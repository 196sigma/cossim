57 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
NitroMed,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of
NitroMed,Inc. as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2006. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
NitroMed,Inc. at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of NitroMed,Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March6,
2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
As discussed in Note 2 and
Note 8 of the financial statements, effective January1, 2006, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 R, Share-Based Payment, using the modified-prospective
transition method.

1. The Company
NitroMed,Inc. the Company is an emerging
pharmaceutical company with substantial expertise and intellectual property in
nitric oxide-based drug development. The Company has devoted substantially all
of its efforts towards the research and development of its product candidates
and the commercialization of its currently marketed product, BiDil. Since its inception, the
Company has funded its operations mainly through the sale of equity securities,
debt financings, license fees, research and development funding, milestone
payments from its collaborative partners and, more recently, sales of BiDil. In
June2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approved the
Companys product, BiDil, for the treatment of heart failure in self-identified
black patients as an adjunct to current standard therapies. BiDil is an orally
administered fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine
hydrochloride. The Company commercially launched BiDil in July2005, and
has since generated approximately $165 million in product sales, including
product sales of $35 million during the fourth quarter of 2006, and total
product sales of $121 million during the year ended December31, 2006.
The Company has used and will continue to require substantial
funds to manufacture, market and sell BiDil during 2007 and beyond. The Company
also expects to incur additional expenses related to the ongoing development of
an extended release formulation of BiDil, called BiDil XR, for which the
Company has recently commenced clinical development. The Company believes that
its existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future
operations will be sufficient to fund the current business plan for at least the
next twelve months.
The Company will require
additional funding in the future and may seek to do so through collaborative
co-promotion arrangements and/or public or private financings. If the Company
is unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, the Company maybe required
to significantly curtail certain of its sales and marketing efforts, and its
development efforts with respect to BiDil XR, and the Company may be required
to limit, scale back or cease its operations. The Company could be required to
seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that
mayrequire the Company to relinquish rights to some of its technologies,
product candidates or products.
2. Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
Cash Equivalents
and Marketable Securities
Cash equivalents are
short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less
at the time of acquisition. Investments with maturities in excess of three
months at the time of acquisition are classified as marketable securities and designated
as available-for-sale. Cash equivalents consist of institutional money market
funds. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair market value, as
reported by the custodian, and unrealized gains and losses are reported as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders
equity. Realized gains and losses were not material for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004.
Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
Financial instruments
mainly consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and
long-term debt. The carrying amounts of these cash and cash equivalents, and
marketable securities approximate their fair values. The fair value of
long-term debt is $93 million. 65  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Research and
Development Expenses
Research and development expenses primarily consist of
salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel, fees paid
to consultants and outside service providers, materials used in clinical trials
and research and development, and medical support costs related to the launch
and commercialization of BiDil. The Company charges research and development
expenses, including costs associated with acquiring patents, to operations as
incurred.
The Company enters into
contracts with professional service providers to conduct clinical trials and
related services. These professional service providers render services over an
extended period of time, generally one to three years. Typically, the Company
enters into two types of vendor contracts, patient-based or time-based.
Under a patient-based contract, the Company first determines an
appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the
contract, which include the estimated number of patients, the cost assigned to
each patient based on a patients number of visits and the total dollar value
of the contract. The Company then records expense based upon the total number
of patients enrolled during the period and the status of each patient. Under a
time-based contract, using critical factors contained within the contract such
as the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided, the
Company records the contractual expense for each service provided ratably over
the period during which the Company estimates the service will be performed. On
a monthly basis, the Company reviews both the timetable of services to be
rendered and the timing of services actually received based on regular
communications with its vendors in order to gauge the reasonableness of its
estimates. Based upon this review, revisions may be made to the forecasted
timetable or the extent of services performed, or both, in order to reflect the
Companys most current estimate of the contract.
Revenue Recognition
The Companys principal source of revenue is the sale
of BiDil, which began shipping in Julyof 2005. Other sources of revenue
to date include license fees, research and development payments and milestone
payments that the Company has received from our corporate collaborators.
Product
Sales/Deferred Revenue. The Company follows the
provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No104, Revenue
Recognition, and recognizes revenue from product sales upon delivery
of product to wholesalers or pharmacies, when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, title to product and
associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectibility of the
related receivable is reasonably assured. All revenues from product sales are
recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns, wholesaler allowances,
rebates, and discounts. For arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed
to wholesalers or pharmacies, the Company defers the recognition of revenue by
recording deferred revenue until such time that risk of loss has passed. In
addition, the Company evaluates its level of shipments to wholesalers and
pharmacies on a quarterly basis compared to the estimated level of inventory in
the channel, remaining shelf-life of the product shipped and quarterly
forecasted sales. As a result of this evaluation, the Company deferred $21
million of revenue from the December2005 shipments and recorded this
amount in deferred revenue as of December31, 2005. During 2006, the
Company reversed $18 million of this deferred revenue and recognized the
remainder as revenue. 66  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Sales Returns, Allowances,
Rebates and Discounts. The Companys product
sales are subject to returns, wholesaler allowances, rebates and cash and
contract discounts that are customary in the pharmaceutical industry. A large
portion of the Companys product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers
for further distribution through pharmacies to patients, who are consumers of
the product. All revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable
allowances for sales returns, wholesaler allowances, rebates and discounts. The
Company determines its provisions for sales returns, allowances, rebates and
discounts based primarily on estimates and contractual terms. In developing a
reasonable estimate for the reserve for product returns, the Company considers
the factors in paragraph 8 of SFAS 48, Revenue Recognition When a
Right of Return Exists. Although the Company has not yet developed a
significant history of product returns because of the recent launch of BiDil,
the Company believes it has developed a reasonable estimate of returns based on
actual return data compared to product shipped. The Company will continue to
monitor actual returns as it gains more sales experience with BiDil.
Product Returns. Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers
contractual return rights that allow customers to return product only during
the period that is six months prior to, and twelve months after product
expiration. Commercial product shipped during 2005 had a shelf-life of twelve
months from date of manufacture with expiration dates ranging from April2006
to November2006. During the third quarter of 2006, the Company began
shipping commercial product with an expiration date of 18 months. Factors that
are considered in the Companys estimate of future product returns include an
analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channels,
discussions with key wholesalers and other customers regarding inventory levels
and shipment trends, review of consumer consumption data as reported by Source
Projected Launchtrac provided by Wolters Kluwer Health, and the remaining time
to expiration of the Companys product. As a result of this ongoing evaluation,
the Companys product return reserve was $13 million at December31, 2006
and $01 million at December31, 2005. This reserve is evaluated on a
quarterly basis, assessing each of the factors described above, and adjusted
accordingly. Based on the factors noted above, the Company believes its estimate
of product returns is reasonable, and changes, if any, from this estimate would
not have a material impact to the Companys financial statements. During the
first quarter of 2007 BiDils shelf life was increased to 24 months.
Initial Trade Shipments Incentive. During Julyof 2005, the Company offered certain
product stocking incentives to a number of wholesalers and pharmacy customers.
These incentives included units with guaranteed sales provisions and extended
payment terms. As a result of these provisions, the Company concluded that
these sales were essentially consignment sales as the risk of loss of this
product had not passed to the customer. Accordingly, the Company deferred all
revenue related to this product until such time as the product is provided to a
patient with a prescription. As of December31, 2005, the remaining
balance of deferred revenue related to this product was $12 million. Through December31,
2006, the Company had either recognized the revenue related to these units, or
the product had been returned or estimated to be returned.
Cash Incentives. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company offered
certain additional incentives to a number of pharmacy customers. These cash
incentives included placement and advertising assistance  67  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
in the amount of $328,000.
The Company recorded this amount as a reduction to revenue during the year
ended December31, 2005. The Company did not offer cash incentives during
the twelve month period ended December31, 2006.
Sample
Voucher and Co-Pay Card Program. Beginning
in the third quarter of 2005, the Company initiated a sample voucher program
whereby the Company offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free 30-day
trial, or approximately 100 tablets, of BiDil. The Company accounted for this
program in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No01-09,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer EITF No01-09. These sample programs have
historically had quarterly expiration dates such that each sample voucher
program is only active for one quarter at a time. As a result, at the end of
each quarter the Company can determine the actual amount of reimbursement
claims received for the vouchers distributed during the quarter. The amount of
reimbursement is recorded as a reduction to revenue. During the third quarter
2006, the Company initiated a six month co-pay program. As a result of these
programs, the Company recorded a reduction to revenue of $05 million and $08
million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
Company expects to continue to offer co-pay incentives in future periods.
Sales
Discounts, Rebates and Allowances. Sales
discounts, rebates and allowances result primarily from sales under contract
with healthcare providers, wholesalers, Medicare and Medicaid programs and
other governmental agencies. The Company estimates rebates and contractual
allowances, cash and contract discounts and other rebates by considering the
following factors: current contract prices and terms, sales volume, and current
actual average rebate rates. For the years ended December31, 2006 and December31,
2005, the Company recorded cash discounts, rebates and other allowances of $15
million and $05 million, respectively.
Collaboration Revenue. The Company records collaboration
revenue on an accrual basis as it is earned and when amounts are considered
collectible. Revenues received in advance of performance obligations or in
cases where the Company has a continuing obligation to perform services, are
deferred and recognized over the contractual or estimated performance period.
Revenues from milestone payments that represent the culmination of a separate
earnings process are recorded when the milestone is achieved. Contract revenues
are recorded as the services are performed. When the Company is required to
defer revenue, the period over which such revenue should be recognized is
subject to estimates by management and may change over the course of the
collaborative agreement. The Company had no collaboration revenue during the
year ended December31, 2006.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable
consists of amounts due from wholesalers and pharmacies for the purchase of
BiDil. Ongoing evaluations of customers payment histories are performed and collateral
is generally not required. As of December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
has not reserved any amount for bad debts related to the sale of BiDil. The
Company continuously reviews all customer accounts to determine if an allowance
for uncollectible accounts is necessary. The Company currently provides
substantially all of its customers with payment terms of net 30 days. Amounts
past due from customers are determined based on contractual payment terms.
Through December31, 2006, payments have generally been made in a timely
manner. 68  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are
recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, which range between three to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized based upon the lesser of the term of the lease or
the useful life of the asset. The Company reviews its property and equipment
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and recognizes an
impairment loss when the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the
carrying value of the asset. The asset is written down to its fair value,
determined by either a quoted market price or by a discounted cash flow
technique, whichever is more appropriate under the circumstances. During 2006,
the Company recorded impairment charges of $13 million See Note 7.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. Inventories consisted of the following

On a quarterly basis, the
Company analyzes its current inventory levels and future irrevocable inventory
purchase commitments and writes down inventory that has become un-saleable, or
has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. In addition,
the Company evaluates its future irrevocable inventory purchase commitments
compared to forecasted product sales, the current level of inventory, and its
related product dating. For the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
recorded inventory impairment charges of $11 million to cost of sales related
to commercial trade and patient sample inventory product, and a $04 million
charge to cost of sales for contractual purchase commitments in excess of
expected future inventory requirements based on the Companys sales forecast.
For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded an inventory
impairment charge of $56 million to cost of sales related to commercial trade
and patient sample inventory product, and a $15 million charge to cost of
sales for contractual purchase commitments in excess of expected future
inventory requirements based on the Companys sales forecast. At December31,
2006, BiDil had an eighteen month shelf life. During the first quarter of 2007,
BiDils shelf life for newly produced finished goods was increased to 24months.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic net loss per share
is computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and the dilutive potential
common stock equivalents then outstanding. Potential common stock equivalents
consist of stock options and warrants.  69  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Since the Company has a
net loss for all periods presented, the effect of all potentially dilutive
securities is antidilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share
is the same.
Options to purchase 4,935,930,
3,819,676 and 3,246,631 shares of common stock for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and warrants to purchase -0 1,319 and 13,861 shares of common stock for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been excluded from the computation of
net loss per share as their effects would have been antidilutive.
Concentration of
Credit Risk
SFAS No105, Disclosure of Information
about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments
with Concentrations of Credit Risk, requires disclosure of any
significant off-balance-sheet and credit risk concentrations. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit
risk consists principally of marketable securities and trade accounts
receivable. The Company has no off-balance-sheet or concentrations of credit
risk such as foreign exchange contracts, options contracts or other hedging arrangements. The Company maintains
its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances with several
high credit quality financial institutions.

Advertising Costs
All advertising costs are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $128 million, $201 million
and $20 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Such estimates relate to allowances for accounts receivable,
product returns rates, contract rebates, the net realizable value of inventory,
useful lives of fixed assets, accrued liabilities, and stock-based
compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such
differences may be material to the financial statements.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss
The Company presents
comprehensive income loss in accordance with SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Accumulated other
comprehensive income is comprised entirely of unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale marketable securities.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting
and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss
carryforwards and tax credits, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and
laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the
uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization.
Segment Information
During the three years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company operated in one
reportable business segment, developing nitric oxide enhancing medicines, under
the management approach of SFAS No131, Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.
Stock-Based Compensation
On December16, 2004,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No123 revised
2004 SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payment,
which is a revision of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. SFAS 123R supersedes APB 25 and
amends SFAS No95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach described in
SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income
statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. Pro forma disclosure
is no longer an alternative. 71 NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued
On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R
using the modified prospective method as permitted under SFAS 123R. Under this
transition method, compensation cost recognized for the year ending December31,
2006 includes: acompensation
cost for all share-based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of December31,
2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123, and bcompensation cost for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the grant-date
fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In
accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption, the Companys
results of operations and financial position for prior periods has not been
restated.
See Note 8 for additional
information relating to stock-based compensation.
New Accounting
Standards
In July2006, the FASB issued FIN48 Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN48. This interpretation requires
that the Company recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax
position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit,
based on the technical merits of the position. The provisions of FIN48
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006
beginning with the Companys 2007 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening
retained earnings. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard
will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
In September2006, the SEC released Staff
Accounting BulletinNo108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year
Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements SAB108. SAB108 provides interpretive guidance on
the SECs views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial
statement misstatements. SAB108 is effective for fiscal years ending
after November15, 2006 beginning with the Companys 2006 fiscal year.
The adoption of SAB108 did not have any impact on the Companys results
of operations or financial position.
In September2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS
No157. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No157 codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, clarifies the
principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market
participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a
fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those
assumptions. SFAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007 and interim periods within those years. The Company does not currently
believe that adoption will have a material impact on its results of operations,
financial position or cash flows. 72  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 3. Cash Equivalents and

Restructuring
In the first quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $20 million related to a restructuring of its
discovery research operations that was intended to better align costs with
revenue and operating expectations. The restructuring charges pertained to
employee severance and impairment of assets and were recorded in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities SFAS
146, and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144.
In connection with the restructuring plan, the Company
terminated 30 employees in its discovery research group, or approximately 30%
of the Companys workforce, resulting in a charge of $14 million, which was
accrued as of March31, 2006. None of these employees remained employed as
of March31, 2006.
As a result of terminating these employees, the
Company recorded an impairment charge for certain research laboratory
equipment, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures aggregating $597,000,
for which the future use was uncertain. These assets were written down to their
fair value utilizing a third party appraiser to estimate the fair value of the
assets based on current market quotes and the current condition of the
equipment, furniture and fixtures.

Stock Based
Compensation
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted
the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based
Payment SFAS 123R,
using the  method. Under this transition method,

non-employees, the Company recognizes compensation expense in accordance with
the requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force No96-18,  76  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 8.
Stockholders Equity Continued
Accounting
for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring,
or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services EITF 96-18.EITF
96-18 requires that companies recognize compensation expense based on the
estimated fair value of options granted to non-employees over their vesting
period, which is generally the period during which services are rendered by
such non-employees. The fair value of unvested non-employee stock awards is
re-measured at each reporting period.
Stock
Option Plans. The Companys Restated 1993 Equity Incentive
Plan the 1993 Plan, which expired in accordance with its terms in 2003,
provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options
and restricted stock awards to purchase up to 2,288,200 shares of the Companys
common stock. Officers, employees, directors, consultants and advisors of the
Company were eligible to receive grants of options under the 1993 Plan at a
price not less than 100% or 110% in the case of incentive stock options granted
to 10% or greater stockholders of the fair market value of the Companys
common stock, as determined by the Companys Board of Directors, at the time
the option was granted. In May2003, the Companys stockholders approved
the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan the 2003 Plan, under which 800,000 shares of
common stock were authorized for issuance. In October2003, the
stockholders of the Company approved an amended and restated 2003 Plan which
provided, among other things, for an increase of shares authorized for issuance
under the 2003 Plan to 2,500,000. In May2005, the stockholders of the
Company approved an amendment to the 2003 Plan which provided for an increase
of shares authorized for issuance under the 2003 Plan to 3,600,000, and the
adoption of an evergreen provision that allows for an annual increase in the
number of shares of the Companys common stock available for issuance under the
2003 Plan. The evergreen provision provides for an annual increase to be added
on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company during the period beginning
in fiscal year 2006 and ending on the second day of fiscal year 2013. The
increase provided by the evergreen provision is equal to the lesser of i1,400,000
shares of the Companys common stock, ii4% of the outstanding shares on
that date or iiian amount determined by the Companys Board of
Directors. In January2006, an additional 1,219,679 shares of common stock
were reserved for issuance under the 2003 Plan. Pursuant to the evergreen
provision, in January2007 an additional 1,400,000 shares of common stock
were reserved for issuance under the 2003 Plan.
While the Company maygrant options to employees
that become exercisable at different times or within different periods, the
Company generally has granted options to employees that are exercisable in
equal annual installments of 25% on each of the first four anniversary dates of
the grant.
Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. On August18, 2003, the Board of
Directors adopted the 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP, which
allows eligible employees to purchase common stock at a price per share equal
to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the
beginning or end of each six month period during the term of the ESPP. The
first offering period began on January1, 2004. During the years ended December31,
2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company issued and sold 32,398, 37,358 and 30,342
shares of common stock, respectively, under the ESPP. In May2006, the
stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the ESPP, which provided
for an increase of shares available for issuance under the ESPP to 150,000, and
the adoption of an evergreen provision that allows for an annual increase in
the number of shares of the Companys common stock available for issuance under
the ESPP. The evergreen provision provides for an annual increase to be added

Board of Directors. Under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, which the Company applied to awards under the ESPP prior
to January1, 2006, the Company was not required to recognize stock-based
compensation expense for the stock options or shares issued under the ESPP. Upon
adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company began recording stock-based compensation
expense related to the ESPP. Pursuant to the evergreen provision, in January2007
an additional 150,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance and
sale under the ESPP.
Grant-date Fair Value. The fair value of each stock award is estimated on
the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the
assumptions noted in the following table

Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the
weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during the years
ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $414, $1151 and $966, respectively.
Volatility is determined exclusively using historical
volatility data of the Companys common stock based on the period of time since
the Companys common stock has been publicly traded. The risk-free interest
rateis based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of
grant commensurate with the expected life assumption. The expected life of
stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the
weighted average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be
outstanding. The expected life is applied to the stock option grant group as a
whole, as the Company does not expect substantially different exercise or
post-vesting termination behavior amongst its employee population.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense. The
Company is using the straight-line attribution method to recognize stock-based
compensation expense. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized
during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are
ultimately expected to vest. SFAS 123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at
the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
forfeitures differ from those estimates.
The term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations
or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered
option. The Company has applied an annual forfeiture rate of 64% to all
unvested options as of December31, 2006. This analysis will be
re-evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary.
Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be
for those options that vest. 78 NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts

The adoption of SFAS 123R on January1, 2006 had
the following impact on fiscal 2006 results: net loss was higher by $80
million, and diluted loss per share was higher by $022, than if the Company
had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25.
The
following table illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share had
the Company applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for the

is calculated by applying an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested options.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the
total intrinsic value of options exercised i.e., the difference between the
market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the
options was $1,887,000, and the total amount of cash received from exercise of
these options was $693,000. The  79  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 8.
Stockholders Equity Continued
total grant-date fair
value of stock options that vested during the year ended December31, 2006
was approximately $37 million.
As of December31, 2006, there was $109 million
of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share based awards.
This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 14
years.
During 1999 and 2000, the Company granted
performance-based options to purchase 75,100 and 100,000 shares of common
stock, respectively, with an exercise price of $130, to certain employees,
which allow for acceleration of the vesting period upon the occurrence of
certain defined events. Of the 100,000 options granted in 2002, 5,000 options
were forfeited in 2002. Based on the terms of the arrangements, the awards were
required to be accounted for as variable, and compensation expense was measured
as the difference between the fair market value of the Companys common stock
at the reporting period date and the exercise price of the award. Compensation
expense is recognized over the vesting period. The Company recognized a
reversal of stock based compensation expense of $261,000 for the year ended December31,
2005, and an expense of $529,000 for the year ended December31, 2004. In
connection with the adoption of SFAS123R, these awards became fixed and their
associated expense is included in stock-based compensation expense for the year
ended December31, 2006.
During 2003 and 2002, the Company granted options to
purchase 413,250 and 241,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to employees
at exercise prices below the deemed fair value for accounting purposes of the
Companys common stock. The weighted average exercise price of these options is
$200 per share. The Company recorded deferred stock compensation expense
related to these grants of $3,317,000 and $566,000 for the years ended December31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. These amounts were being recognized as stock-based
compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of four years. Included in
the results of operations for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004
is stock based compensation expense of $887,000 and $982,000, respectively. In
connection with the adoption of SFAS 123R in January2006, the Company
reversed the remaining deferred stock compensation balance of $1,208,000. The
fair value of these awards is accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123R, and
related stock compensation expense is included in the statement of operations
for the year ended December31, 2006.
Since 1999, the Company
has granted options to purchase a total of 201,000 shares of common stock to
nonemployees at a weighted-average exercise price of $350 per share, of
which 125,000 remained outstanding at December31, 2006. The Company has
applied the recognition provisions of EITF96-18 related to these
stock options and utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to
determine the fair value of these stock options at each reporting date. In
connection with these awards, the Company recognized a reversal of stock based
compensation expense of $239,000, and $133,000 for the years ended December31,
2006, and 2005, respectively, and an expense of $1,011,000 for the year ended December31,
2004.

10. License, Manufacturing
and Commercialization Agreements
The Company has entered into various research, license
and commercialization agreements to support its research and development and
commercialization activities.
Elan. In February 2007, in
connection with the Companys efforts to develop BiDil XR, the Company entered
into a license agreement with Elan Pharma International Limited Elan.
Pursuant to the agreement, Elan granted to the Company an exclusive worldwide
license, for the term of the agreement, to certain know-how, patents and
technology, and any improvements to any of the foregoing developed by either
party during the term of the agreement.
Pursuant to this license, the Company has the right to import, use,
offer for sale and sell the oral capsule formulation incorporating specified
technology referred to in the agreement and containing, as its sole active
combination of ingredients, the combination of the active drug substances
isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride, including BiDil XR. In consideration for the grant of the

meet certain obligations set forth in the agreement with respect to such
country, provided that Elan must first consult with us and, if applicable, provide
us with an opportunity to meet such obligations prior to exercising Elans
termination rights.
Boston
Scientific Collaboration. In November2001,
the Company entered into a research, development and license agreement with
Boston Scientific in the field of restenosis. The Company granted Boston
Scientific an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize nitric
oxide-enhancing cardiovascular stents. The Company also granted to Boston
Scientific a right of first refusal to obtain an exclusive license under the
Companys nitric oxide technologies to commercialize products for restenosis,
which right of first refusal is for a period of three years after the end of
the research term. In December2003, the Company agreed to extend the
agreement to continue the research and development collaboration through December2005.
The research term of the Boston Scientific agreement expired on December31,
2005, although certain rights extend beyond this term. Boston Scientific made
an up-front license payment of $15million to the Company in 2001, and
made an additional payment of $30million in December2003 in
connection with the extension of the research and development collaboration.
The Company recognized the up-front license payments ratably over the term of
the contractual performance obligation. For the years ended December31,
2005, and 2004, the Company recognized revenue of $16million,
respectively. In the event that specified research, development and
commercialization milestones were achieved, Boston Scientific would have been
obligated to make milestone payments to the Company. In addition, Boston
Scientific also would have been obligated to pay royalties to the Company on
the sale of any products resulting from the collaboration. Boston Scientific
made a $35million equity investment in the Companys stock in 2001. In August2003,
in connection with a private placement, Boston Scientific made an additional
$500,000 equity investment the Companys stock.
Merck
Collaboration. From December2002 until November2004,
the Company was party to an exclusive, worldwide research, collaboration and
licensing agreement that granted Merck a license to certain existing nitric
oxide-enhancing COX-2 technology and any technology pertaining to the
license technology developed by the Company under this agreement. The research
portion of the agreement was for three years, and the Company was obligated to
perform certain research and development activities in consideration of
quarterly fees totaling $72 million. In consideration of this license in 2003,
the Company  82  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 10.
License, Manufacturing and Commercialization Agreements Continued
received an upfront
non-refundable license payment of $100million, and two payments, each of
$50million, for achieving the first two milestones. The license fee
revenue and the revenue from the first $50million milestone payment were
recognized ratably over the contractual term of the research and development
program, which was expected to end on December31, 2005. The revenue from
the second $50million payment was recognized in the fourth quarter of
2003, the period in which Merck achieved the milestone. On September30,
2004, Merck halted the phase II trial of the Companys lead candidate in nitric
oxide-enhancing COX-2 inhibitors. This lead nitric oxide candidate is
composed of a derivative of rofecoxib. Rofecoxib is the active ingredient in
Vioxx, a COX-2 inhibitor which Merck voluntarily withdrew from worldwide
markets on September30, 2004. In November2004, the Company agreed
with Merck to terminate the collaboration agreement. Merck paid the Company a
lump sum of $18million, representing the full amount of the research
funding owed to the Company for 2005, however, the Company will not receive any
commercialization milestones or royalty payments from Merck. As a result of the
termination of this agreement, the Company accelerated the recognition of
deferred license revenue of $53million in the fourth quarter of 2004,
and the Company recognized the lump sum payment of $18million as revenue
in the fourth quarter of 2004. Under this agreement the Company recognized
revenue of $149 million for the year ended December31, 2004.
Dr.Jay
N. Cohn. In January1999, as amended in January2001
and March2002, the Company entered into a collaboration and license
agreement with Dr.Jay N. Cohn. Under the agreement, Dr.Cohn
licensed to the Company an exclusive worldwide royalty-bearing license to
technology and inventions owned or controlled by Dr.Cohn and that relate
to BiDil for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Upon achieving certain
developmental events, the Company was required to make milestone payments
totaling $10 million, which were recorded as a charge to research and
development expenses in 2004. Upon commercial sale of BiDil, the Company is
required to make royalty payments based on net sales at varying rates depending
on sales volume. The royalty terms expires upon the later of the expiration of
the patent rights or ten years from the first commercial sale. During the years
ended December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company incurred royalty expenses of
$364,000 and $134,000, respectively. The agreement imposes upon the Company an
obligation to use reasonable best efforts to develop and, upon receipt of
regulatory approval, manufacture, market and commercialize products based upon
the licensed rights. If the Company fails to meet this obligation, Dr.Cohn
has the right to terminate the agreement and the license granted to the Company
under the agreement. Dr.Cohn also has the right to terminate the
agreement if the Company materially breaches the agreement and fails to remedy
the breach within 30days. The Company has the right to terminate the
agreement at any time upon 30days prior written notice. Unless earlier
terminated, the agreement continues in perpetuity. Pursuant to the agreement, Dr.Cohn
was appointed to the Companys then-current scientific advisory board, entered
into a consulting agreement with the Company and was granted an option to
purchase 10,000 shares of the Companys common stock. 83 NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts

The Company has increased
its valuation allowance by $28,243,000 in 2006 to provide a full valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets since the realization of these benefits is
not considered more likely than not. At December31, 2006, the Company had
unused net operating loss carryforwards of $206,896,000 available to reduce
federal taxable income expiring in 2010 through 2025 and $190,072,000 available
to reduce state taxable income expiring in 2006 through 2010. The Company also
has federal and state research tax credits of
$7,755,000 available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of
which expire beginning in 2010. The net operating losses and tax credit
carryforwards may be subject to the annual limitation provisions of Internal
Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383. No income tax payments were made in 2006,
2005 or 2004.
12. Commitments and
Contingencies
In connection with the
Companys efforts to obtain the approval of BiDil from the FDA, the Company
contracted with the law firm of FoxKiser LLC FoxKiser for services related
to the regulatory approval process for BiDil. The agreement provided for
payment of legal consulting fees upon receipt of written FDA approval of BiDil.
In addition, the agreement requires the Company to pay royalties to FoxKiser on
commercial sales of BiDil. The royalty term ends six months after the date of
market introduction of an  84  NITROMED,INC. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued all tabular amounts in thousands except per share amounts 12.
Commitments and Contingencies Continued
FDA-approved generic
version of BiDil. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company entered into a
separate consulting agreement with FoxKiser following the approval by the FDA
of BiDil. During the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company recorded charges of $09 million, $16million and
$19million, respectively, pertaining to the legal consulting fees, and
$364,000, $134,000 and $-0-, respectively, pertaining to royalty
expenses related to these agreements.
An academic institution has asserted that patents and
patent applications which relate to the nitric oxide stent program may require
a license from such institution. It is the opinion of the Companys management
and outside legal counsel that the disputed intellectual property has been
validly licensed to, or is validly owned by, the Company. Accordingly, the
accompanying financial statements do not include any provision related to this
claim.
In November2004, as amended in May2005,
the Company executed an agreement with Publicis Selling Solutions,Inc. Publicis,
a contract sales organization, pursuant to which, on the Companys behalf, Publicis
employed and trained a specialty sales force consisting of approximately 142
sales representatives to sell BiDil to the Companys target prescriber markets.
The Company recorded costs in 2006 and 2005 of $108 million and $298 million,
respectively, excluding one-time start-up costs and project costs. The Company
transitioned the Publicis sales force internally to NitroMed in May2006
and paid a liquidated damages fee of $500,000 and a sales force transition fee
of $348,000 in the second quarter of 2006. As a result of the sales force
transition, the Company no longer has a significant contractual commitment with
Publicis.
On February16, 2005,
the Company engaged Schwarz Pharma Manufacturing,Inc. Schwarz Pharma
under a five-year exclusive manufacturing and supply agreement solely for the
three times daily immediate release dosage formulation of BiDil. Under the
supply agreement, the Company has the right to engage a backup manufacturer. At
December31, 2006, the Company has outstanding binding purchase orders of
$11 million for production of BiDil finished goods.

AND PROCEDURES
a Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures. Our management, with the participation of our
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31,
2006. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules13a-15eand
15d-15eunder the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the SECs rulesand forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in

financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule13a-15for

by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors,
management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and includes those policies and procedures that Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company;and
Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a

internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. In
making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

Based on this assessment, our management concluded
that, as of December31, 2006, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has
issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial
reporting. This report appears below. 89 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and
Stockholders
NitroMed,Inc.
We have audited managements
assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
that NitroMed,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. NitroMed,Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements
assessment that NitroMed,Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, NitroMed,Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria.
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the balance sheets of NitroMed,Inc.
as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2006 of NitroMed,Inc. and our report
dated March6, 2007 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.
