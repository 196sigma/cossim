REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Tenneco Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tenneco Inc. a Delaware
corporation and consolidated subsidiaries see Note 1 as of December 31,
1997 and 1996, and the related statements of income, cash flows and changes in
shareowners' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are
the responsibility of Tenneco Inc. management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Tenneco Inc. and
consolidated subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of
their operations, cash flows and changes in shareowners' equity for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in the fourth quarter of
1997, Tenneco Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries changed their method of
accounting for certain costs incurred in connection with information
technology transformation projects.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The supplemental schedule listed in the
index to Part IV, Item 14 relating to Tenneco Inc. and consolidated
subsidiaries is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and
Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements.
The supplemental schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements of Tenneco Inc.
and consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Consolidation and Presentation
The financial statements of Tenneco Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries
Tenneco include all majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments in 20% to 50%
owned companies where Tenneco has the ability to exert significant influence
over operating and financial policies are carried at cost plus equity in
undistributed earnings since the date of acquisition and cumulative
translation adjustments. All significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated.
In December 1996, Tenneco Inc. was spun-off from the company formerly known
as Tenneco Inc. Old Tenneco in a series of transactions the
Transaction, which included distributions the Distributions to Old
Tenneco shareowners and a subsequent merger the Merger. Following the
Transaction, Tenneco owned the automotive parts Tenneco Automotive,
packaging Tenneco Packaging and administrative services Tenneco Business
Services businesses of Old Tenneco. These transactions and their accounting
treatment are described in more detail in Note 3, Discontinued Operations,
Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary Loss.
For purposes of these financial statements, Tenneco or the Company
refers to Old Tenneco and its subsidiaries before the Transaction and to
Tenneco Inc., formerly known as New Tenneco Inc. New Tenneco, and its
subsidiaries subsequent to the Transaction.
Income Taxes
Tenneco utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby
it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, based upon management
estimates, it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in the
recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future periods
based on new facts or circumstances.
Tenneco does not provide for U.S. income taxes on unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries as it is the present intention of management to reinvest
the unremitted earnings in its foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of
foreign subsidiaries are approximately $740 million at December 31, 1997. It
is not practicable to determine the amount of U.S. income taxes that would be
payable upon remittance of the assets that represent those earnings.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF Issue 97-13, Accounting for Costs Incurred in Connection
with a Consulting Contract that Combines Business Process Reengineering and
Information Technology Transformation, Tenneco recorded an after-tax charge
of $46 million $27 per common share on both the basic and diluted bases,
net of a tax benefit of $28 million, in the fourth quarter of 1997. EITF 97-13
establishes the accounting treatment and an allocation methodology for certain
consulting and other costs incurred in connection with information technology
transformation efforts. This charge was reported as a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle.
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards FAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
established new standards for computing and presenting earnings per share. The
provisions of the statement are effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 1997, and accordingly have been adopted in the accompanying
financial statements including the restatement
42
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
of previously reported earnings per share. Basic and diluted earnings per
share, as reported, are not materially different from earnings per share as
calculated in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, the
previous earnings per share standard.
Effective January 1, 1997, Tenneco adopted the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental
Remediation Liabilities. This statement established new accounting and
reporting standards for recognizing and disclosing environmental remediation
liabilities. Tenneco also adopted FAS No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. This new
statement established new accounting and reporting standards for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishing liabilities. The adoption of
these new standards did not have a significant effect on Tenneco financial
position or results of operations.
Tenneco adopted FAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, in the first quarter of
1996. FAS No. 121 establishes new accounting standards for measuring the
impairment of long-lived assets. The adoption of this new standard did not
have a significant effect on Tenneco financial position or results of
operations.
Inventories
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, inventory by major classification was as
follows:
1997  1996
MILLIONS
Finished  $ 467 $ 408
Work in   100  118
Raw   265  245
Materials and   118  107
$ 950  $878
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. A portion of total
inventories 44% and 46% at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively is valued
using the last-in, first-out method. All other inventories are valued on the
first-in, first-out FIFO or average methods. If the FIFO or average
method of inventory accounting had been used by Tenneco for all inventories,
inventories would have been $45 million and $54 million higher at December 31,
1997 and 1996, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangibles
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, goodwill and intangibles by major category
were as follows:
1997  1996
MILLIONS
$1,212 $ 963
182  187
160  156
23   35
$1,577 $1,341
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging
from 20 years to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $36 million, $21
million, and $10 million for 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively, and is
included in the statements of income caption, Depreciation, depletion and
amortization.

over periods ranging from 5 to 40 years. Such amortization amounted to $24
million and $26 million in 1997 and 1996, was not significant during 1995, and
is included in the statements of income caption, Depreciation, depletion and
amortization.
Plant, Property, and Equipment, at Cost

and equipment. Depletion of timber and timberlands is provided on a unit-of-
production basis.
Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Short and long-term notes receivable of $60 million and $65 million were
outstanding at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the short and long-term allowance for
doubtful accounts on accounts and notes receivable was $35 million and $32
million, respectively.
Environmental Liabilities
Expenditures for ongoing compliance with environmental regulations that
relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations
and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are
expensed. Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments indicate
that remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.
Estimates of the liability are based upon currently available facts, existing
technology, and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into
consideration the likely effects of inflation and other societal and economic
factors. All available evidence is considered including prior experience in
remediation of contaminated sites, other companies' clean-up experience, and
data released by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or other
organizations. These estimated liabilities are subject to revision in future
periods based on actual costs or new information. These liabilities are
included in the balance sheet at their undiscounted amounts. Recoveries are
evaluated separately from the liability and, when assured, are recorded and
reported separately from the associated liability in the financial statements.
For further information on this subject, refer to Note 13, Commitments and
Contingencies.
Earnings Per Share
According to the requirements of FAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, basic
earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common
shareowners by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of
basic earnings
44
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
per share except that the weighted-average number of shares outstanding is
adjusted to include estimates of additional shares that would be issued if
potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. In addition, income
available to common shareowners is adjusted to include any changes in income
or loss that would result from the assumed issuance of the dilutive common
shares.
Tenneco preferred stock outstanding before the Merger was converted into
El Paso Natural Gas Company El Paso common stock as part of the Merger;
therefore, preferred stock dividends have been deducted from income from
discontinued operations in determining earnings per share. For more
information regarding the Merger, see Note 3, Discontinued Operations,
Disposition of Assets, and Extraordinary Loss.
Allocation of Corporate Debt and Interest Expense
Tenneco historical practice has been to incur indebtedness for its
consolidated group at the parent company level or at a limited number of
subsidiaries, rather than at the operating company level, and to centrally
manage various cash functions. Consequently, corporate debt of Tenneco
outstanding before the Transaction has been allocated to discontinued
operations based upon the ratio of the discontinued operations' net assets to
Tenneco consolidated net assets plus debt. Interest expense, net of tax, has
been allocated to Tenneco discontinued operations based on the same
allocation methodology. See Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Disposition of
Assets, and Extraordinary Loss, for further discussion regarding the
Transaction.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development expenses were $53 million, $60 million, and $42 million for 1997,
1996, and 1995, respectively, and are included in the income statement caption
Engineering, research, and development expenses.
Realignment Charges
In 1996, the Company recorded charges of approximately $70 million in
connection with the reorganization of Tenneco Packaging folding carton
operations and the realignment of Tenneco Automotive: i Walker exhaust
system original equipment and aftermarket manufacturing operations in Europe,
ii Walker aftermarket operations in North America, and iii Monroe ride
control product line.
In 1995, Tenneco Packaging recorded charges of approximately $30 million in
connection with the realignment of molded fiber and aluminum foil operations.
Foreign Currency Translation
Financial statements of international operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and
liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for each applicable period
for revenues, expenses, and gains and losses. Translation adjustments are
reflected in the balance sheet caption Cumulative translation adjustments.
Risk Management Activities
Tenneco uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency
forward purchase and sale contracts with terms of less than one year, to hedge
its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Tenneco primary
exposure to changes in foreign currency rates results from intercompany loans
made between Tenneco affiliates to minimize the need for borrowings from third
parties. Net gains or losses on these foreign currency exchange contracts that
are designated as hedges are recognized in the income statement to offset the
45
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
foreign currency gain or loss on the underlying transaction. Additionally,
Tenneco enters into foreign currency forward purchase and sale contracts to
mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates on intercompany and third
party trade receivables and payables. Since these anticipated transactions are
not firm commitments, Tenneco marks these forward contracts to market each
period and records any gain or loss in the income statement. Tenneco has from
time to time also entered into forward contracts to hedge its net investment
in foreign subsidiaries. The after-tax net gains or losses on these contracts
are recognized on the accrual basis in the balance sheet caption Cumulative
translation adjustments. In the statement of cash flows, cash receipts or
payments related to these exchange contracts are classified consistent with
the cash flows from the transaction being hedged.
Tenneco does not currently enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions in determining the reported amounts of Tenneco assets,
liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Reference is made to the Income Taxes
section of this footnote and Notes 10, 11, and 13 for additional information
on significant estimates included in Tenneco financial statements.
Reclassifications
Prior years' financial statements have been reclassified where appropriate
to conform to 1997 presentations.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In March 1997, Tenneco entered into an agreement to acquire the protective
and flexible packaging division of NV Koninklijke KNP BT KNP, a Dutch
distribution, paper and packaging firm, for approximately $380 million
including debt assumed and preferred stock of a subsidiary issued to a seller.
Upon completion of the KNP acquisition in late April 1997, KNP became a part
of Tenneco Packaging. Also during 1997, Tenneco completed acquisitions or
investments in other businesses and joint ventures, principally, in the
automotive parts industry, for total consideration of approximately $38
million.
A preliminary allocation of the purchase price has been made for these
acquisitions. A final determination of the purchase price allocation will be
made upon the completion of certain ongoing appraisals; however, management
does not believe that any adjustments to the preliminary purchase price
allocation will be material to Tenneco financial position or results of
operations.
In June 1996, Tenneco entered into agreements to acquire Clevite for $328
million and Amoco Foam Products for $310 million. Clevite makes suspension
bushings and other elastomeric parts for cars and trucks. Upon completion of
the Clevite acquisition in July 1996, Clevite operations became part of
Tenneco Automotive. Amoco Foam Products manufactures expanded polystyrene
tableware, hinged-lid food containers, packaging trays, and industrial
products for residential and commercial construction applications. Tenneco
closed the acquisition of Amoco Foam Products in August 1996, and Amoco Foam
Products became part of Tenneco Packaging. Also during 1996, Tenneco completed
the acquisitions of or investments in various other businesses and joint
ventures, principally in the automotive parts industry, for total
consideration of approximately $110 million.
In November 1995, Tenneco Packaging acquired the plastics division of Mobil
Corporation for $13 billion. The plastics business is one of the largest
North American producers of polyethylene and polystyrene consumer and food
service packaging.
46
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Also during 1995, Tenneco Packaging completed additional acquisitions of
seven paperboard packaging businesses and three specialty packaging businesses
for a total purchase price of approximately $196 million. In addition, Tenneco
Automotive completed four acquisitions in 1995 for a total purchase price of
approximately $54 million.
All of the acquisitions discussed above have been accounted for as
purchases; accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets
purchased and the liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The excess
of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is
included in the balance sheet caption Goodwill and intangibles, net.
3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, AND EXTRAORDINARY LOSS
Discontinued Operations
The Energy Business and Shipbuilding Business
Tenneco Inc. was spun-off from Old Tenneco on December 11, 1996, following a
series of transactions undertaken to realign the assets, liabilities, and
operations of Old Tenneco such that Tenneco Automotive, Tenneco Packaging, and
Tenneco Business Services were owned by New Tenneco and the shipbuilding
business was owned by Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Newport News. On
December 11, 1996, Old Tenneco distributed the shares of New Tenneco and
Newport News to its shareowners. On December 12, 1996, Old Tenneco, which then
consisted primarily of the energy business and certain previously discontinued
operations of Old Tenneco, merged with a subsidiary of El Paso.
Although the separation of Tenneco Inc. from Old Tenneco was structured as a
spin-off for legal, tax and other reasons, Tenneco Inc. kept certain important
aspects of Old Tenneco, including its executive management, Board of
Directors, and headquarters. Most importantly, the combined assets, revenues,
and operating income of Tenneco Automotive and Tenneco Packaging represented
more than half the assets, revenues, and operating income of Old Tenneco
before the Distributions and Merger. Consequently, Tenneco Inc. financial
statements for periods before the Distributions and Merger present the net
assets and results of operations of Old Tenneco shipbuilding and energy
businesses, as well as its farm and construction equipment business which was
disposed of before the Distributions and Merger, as discontinued operations.
In connection with the Distributions, one share of New Tenneco common stock
$01 par value was issued for each share of Old Tenneco common stock $500
par value and one share of Newport News common stock was issued for each five
shares of Old Tenneco common stock. Also, in connection with the Merger, Old
Tenneco shareowners received shares of El Paso common stock valued at
approximately $914 million in the aggregate in exchange for their shares of
Old Tenneco common and preferred stock. The treasury shares held by Old
Tenneco did not participate in the Merger and Distributions and were retained
by Old Tenneco in the Merger. Subsequent to the Transaction, the common equity
of Tenneco Inc. relates solely to the shares of New Tenneco common stock
issued in the Distributions. In connection with the Transaction, the retained
earnings accumulated deficit of Old Tenneco was eliminated. Retained
earnings accumulated deficit shown on the balance sheets represents net
earnings losses accumulated after the date of the Transaction. The effects
of the issuance of New Tenneco common stock in the Distributions, the
retention of treasury shares by Old Tenneco, and the elimination of Old
Tenneco retained earnings accumulated deficit have been reflected in the
statements of changes in shareowners' equity as Recapitalization of New
Tenneco.

On December 11, 1996, one day before the Merger, Old Tenneco completed the
distribution of the common stock of Newport News to the holders of Old Tenneco
common stock. As part of the Distributions, Newport News retained the net
assets of the shipbuilding business, including approximately $600 million of
debt that had been issued during November 1996.
Net assets as of December 31, 1995, and results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, for the shipbuilding business were as

The costs incurred to complete the Transaction, consisting primarily of
financial advisory, legal, accounting, printing, and other costs, of
approximately $108 million, net of a $17 million income tax benefit, were
recorded as a component of 1996 income from discontinued operations.
Farm and Construction Equipment Operations
In June 1994, Tenneco completed an initial public offering IPO of
approximately 29% of the common stock of Case Corporation Case, the holder
of Tenneco farm and construction equipment segment. In November 1994, a
secondary offering of Case common stock reduced Tenneco ownership interest
in Case to approximately 44%. Combined proceeds from the two transactions was
$694 million, net of commissions and

offering expenses. The combined gain on the transactions was $36 million,
including a $7 million tax benefit. In an August 1995 public offering, Tenneco
sold an additional 161 million shares of Case common stock for net proceeds
of approximately $540 million. The sale resulted in a gain of $101 million and
reduced Tenneco ownership in Case from 44% to 21%. In December 1995, Tenneco
sold to a third party a subordinated note receivable due from Case, which was
received as part of the reorganization preceding the Case IPO, for net
proceeds of $298 million and recognized a gain of $32 million. In March 1996,
Tenneco sold its remaining 152 million shares of common stock of Case in a
public offering. Net proceeds of approximately $788 million were received,
resulting in a gain of $340 million, net of $83 million in income tax expense.
Net assets as of December 31, 1995, and results of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, for the farm and construction equipment
segment are as follows:

Chemicals Operations
In March 1995, Tenneco completed an IPO of 100% of its Albright & Wilson
chemicals segment which was reflected as discontinued operations in the 1994
financial statements. The offering was underwritten in the United Kingdom and
was offered primarily in the United Kingdom. Net proceeds from the sale of the
chemicals operations were approximately $700 million.
Disposition of Assets
In the second quarter of 1996, Tenneco Packaging entered into an agreement
to form a joint venture with Caraustar Industries whereby Tenneco Packaging
sold its two recycled paperboard mills and a fiber recycling operation and
brokerage business to the joint venture in return for cash and an equity
interest in the joint venture. Proceeds from the sale were approximately $115
million and the Company recognized a $50 million pre-tax gain in the second
quarter of 1996.
In 1995, Tenneco sold certain facilities and assets, principally at its
Tenneco Packaging segment. Proceeds from these dispositions totaled
approximately $56 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $15 million.
Gains and losses on the sale of businesses and assets have been included in
the caption Other income, net in the accompanying statements of income.

TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Extraordinary Loss
In preparation for the Transaction, Old Tenneco realigned $38 billion of
indebtedness the Debt Realignment through various cash tender offers, debt
exchanges, defeasances, and other retirements. The cash funding required to
consummate the Debt Realignment was financed through internally generated
cash, borrowings under new credit facilities of both Old Tenneco and New
Tenneco, borrowings under a new credit facility and other financings at
Newport News, and proceeds from the issuance of 8 1/4% cumulative junior
preferred stock NPS Preferred Stock, which was retained by Old Tenneco in
the Merger. As a result of the Merger, El Paso indirectly acquired
approximately $28 billion of debt and preferred stock obligations as well as
certain liabilities related to operations previously discontinued by Old
Tenneco.
As a result of the Debt Realignment, Tenneco recognized an extraordinary
loss of approximately $236 million, net of a tax benefit of approximately $126
million. This extraordinary loss consists principally of the fair value paid
in the cash tender offers and the fair value of debt exchanged in the debt
exchange offers in excess of the historical net carrying value for the debt
tendered and exchanged.

the committed long-term credit facilities is reduced by outstanding
commercial paper borrowings.
At December 31, 1997, Tenneco principal credit facility, which expires in
2001, was a $175 billion committed financing arrangement with a syndicate of
banks and other financial institutions. Committed borrowings under this credit
facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the borrower option,
either i a rate consisting of the higher of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points; ii a
rate of LIBOR plus a margin determined based on the credit rating of Tenneco
long-term debt; or iii a rate based on money market rates pursuant to
competitive bids by the syndicate banks.
The credit facility requires that the Company consolidated ratio of debt
to total capitalization, as defined in the credit facility, not exceed 70%.
Compliance with this requirement is a condition for any incremental borrowings
under the credit facility and failure to meet the requirement enables the
syndicate banks to require repayment of any outstanding loans after a 30-day
cure period. At December 31, 1997, Tenneco ratio of debt to total
capitalization as defined in the credit facility was 535%. In addition, the
credit facility imposes certain other restrictions, none of which are expected
to limit the Company ability to operate its business in the ordinary course.

1996, respectively, which were not recognized in the statements of income when
generated. These unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from foreign tax
loss carryforwards which are available to reduce future foreign tax
liabilities.
All of the U.S. tax loss carryforwards, $289 million at December 31, 1997,
expire in 2012. Of the foreign tax loss carryforwards at December 31, 1997, $3
million will expire in 2001, $21 million will expire in 2003, and $175 million
do not expire.
In connection with the corporate reorganization transactions discussed in
Note 3, Discontinued Operations, Disposition of Assets and Extraordinary
Loss, Tenneco entered into a tax sharing agreement with Newport News, Old
Tenneco and El Paso. The tax sharing agreement provides, among other things,
for the allocation among the parties of tax liabilities arising before, as a
result of, and after the Distributions. For periods after the Distributions,
Tenneco will be liable for taxes imposed on its businesses, Old Tenneco will
be liable for taxes imposed on the energy business, and Newport News will be
liable for taxes imposed on the shipbuilding business. In the case of federal
income taxes imposed on the activities of the Old Tenneco consolidated group
before the Distributions, Tenneco and Newport News are generally liable to Old
Tenneco for federal income taxes attributable to their respective businesses,
and those entities have been allocated an agreed-upon share of estimated tax
payments made by Old Tenneco.

Stock Plans
Tenneco Inc. Stock Ownership Plan--In December 1996, Tenneco adopted the
1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which permits the granting of a variety of awards,
including common stock, restricted stock, performance shares, stock
appreciation rights, and stock options to directors, officers, and employees
of Tenneco. Tenneco can issue up to 17,000,000 shares of common stock under
the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan, which will terminate December 31, 2001. All Old
Tenneco stock options granted to New Tenneco employees before the
Distributions were, in connection with the Distributions, cancelled and
replaced with options to purchase New Tenneco common stock according to the
provisions of the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan. The options were replaced with
the appropriate number of New Tenneco options so that the aggregate option
value immediately after the Distributions equaled the aggregate value
immediately before the Distributions. The 1994 Stock Ownership Plan was
terminated effective as of December 11, 1996.
Restricted Stock and Performance Shares--Tenneco has granted restricted
stock and restricted units under the 1996 Stock Ownership Plan to certain key
employees. These awards generally require, among other things, that the
employee remain an employee of Tenneco during the restriction period. Tenneco
has also granted performance shares to certain key employees which will vest
based upon the attainment of specified performance goals within four years
from the date of grant. During 1997, 1996, and 1995, Tenneco granted 494,350,
465,075, and 481,625 shares and units, respectively, with a weighted average
fair value based on the price of Tenneco stock on the grant date of $4306 4854, and $4362 per share, respectively. Any restricted stock and
performance shares awarded after the Distributions are issued under the 1996
Stock Ownership Plan. At December 31, 1997, 127,270 restricted shares at an
average price of $4253 per share, 324,395 performance shares at an average
price of $4326 per share, and no restricted units were outstanding under this
plan.
Under another arrangement, restricted stock or restricted units are issued
annually to each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer
of Tenneco. During 1996 and 1995, 3,300, and 3,000 restricted shares were
issued with a weighted average fair value based on the price of Tenneco
stock on the grant date of $4825 and $4288 per share, respectively. On
November 1, 1996, all outstanding restricted shares were vested.
55
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
In December 1996, Tenneco adopted a new restricted stock and unit plan for
each member of the Board of Directors who is not also an officer of Tenneco.
During 1997 and 1996, 5,040 and 23,464 restricted shares were issued under the
new plan at a weighted average fair value of Tenneco Inc. stock on the grant
date of $4519 and $4531 per share, respectively. At December 31, 1997,
28,504 restricted shares at an average price of $4529 per share were
outstanding under the new plan.
In conjunction with the Transaction, all outstanding restricted shares and
performance shares as of November 1, 1996, were vested and Tenneco recognized
an after-tax compensation expense of $18 million, of which approximately $7
million related to restricted stock and performance shares awarded to
employees of the energy business and shipbuilding business.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan--In June 1992, Tenneco initiated an Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the 1992 ESPP. The 1992 ESPP was terminated as of the
date of the Distributions. Effective April 1, 1997, Tenneco adopted a new ESPP
with provisions similar to the 1992 ESPP. The ESPP allows U.S. and Canadian
Tenneco employees to purchase Tenneco Inc. common stock at a 15% discount.
Each year employees participating in the ESPP may purchase shares with a
discounted value not to exceed $21,250. Under the respective ESPPs, Tenneco
sold 244,768, 657,936, and 633,495 shares to employees in 1997, 1996, and
1995, respectively. The weighted average fair value of the employee purchase
right, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and
the assumptions described below except that the average life of each purchase
right was assumed to be 90 days, was $1116, $1084, and $939 in 1997, 1996,
and 1995, respectively.

Tenneco applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, to account for its stock-based compensation plans.
Tenneco recognized after-tax stock-based compensation expense in 1997 of $5
million and in 1996 of $27 million, of which $9 million related to restricted
stock and performance shares awarded to employees of the energy business and
the shipbuilding business. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in 1995
was not material. Had compensation costs for Tenneco stock-based
compensation plans been determined in accordance with FAS No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, based on the fair value at the grant dates for
the awards under those plans, Tenneco pro forma net income to common stock
and earnings per share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1996, would have been lower by $34 million, or $20 per both basic and
diluted common share, and $14 million, or $08 per both basic and diluted
common share, respectively. The increase in compensation expense was primarily
the result of stock options issued subsequent to the Transaction.
Stock Employee Compensation Trust SECT
In November 1992, Tenneco established the SECT to fund a portion of its
obligations arising from its various employee compensation and benefit plans.
Tenneco issued 12 million shares of treasury stock to the SECT in exchange for
a promissory note of $432 million that accrued interest at the rate of 78%
per annum. At December 31, 1996, all shares had been utilized.
Shareholder Rights Plan
In connection with the Distributions, Tenneco Inc. adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan the Plan, which is substantially the same as the provisions of
the Old Tenneco Shareholder Rights Plan adopted in 1988. The Plan was adopted
to deter coercive takeover tactics and to prevent a potential acquiror from
gaining control of Tenneco in a transaction which is not in the best interests
of Tenneco Inc. shareholders. Under the Plan, each outstanding share of
Tenneco Inc. common stock receives one Right, exercisable at $130, subject to
adjustment. In the event a person or group i acquires 20% or more of the
outstanding Tenneco Inc. common stock other than pursuant to an offer for all
shares of such common stock that a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors who are not officers of the Company determines is fair and in the
best interests of Tenneco Inc. and its shareholders, or ii has in the
judgment of the Tenneco Inc. Board of Directors acquired 10% or more of the
outstanding Tenneco Inc. common stock under certain motives deemed adverse to
Tenneco best interests, each Right entitles the holder to purchase shares of
common stock or other securities of Tenneco Inc. or, under certain
circumstances, of the acquiring person, having a value of twice the exercise
price. The Rights, under certain circumstances, are redeemable by Tenneco Inc.
at a price of $02 per Right. The Plan is scheduled to terminate in 1998.

b In 1992, 12 million shares of common stock were issued to the SECT.
Shares of common stock issued to a related trust are not considered
to be outstanding in the computation of average shares until the
shares are used to fund the obligations of the trust. During each of
the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, the SECT used 4,358,084
and 2,697,770 shares, respectively. At December 31, 1996, all shares
were used. Stock repurchase plans also affect common stock
outstanding. See Note 7 for additional information regarding these
plans.  
c During 1995, Tenneco Inc. 10% loan stock outstanding was convertible
into common stock. The impact of the assumed conversion on income
from continuing operations was $12,746 and on average shares of
common stock outstanding was 28,770 shares. At December 31, 1995, all
loan stock was converted.

8. PREFERRED STOCK
Tenneco had 50 million shares of preferred stock $01 par value authorized
at December 31, 1997 and 1996. No shares of preferred stock were outstanding
at the respective dates. Tenneco has designated and reserved 35 million
shares of the preferred stock as junior preferred stock for the Shareholder
Rights Plan.
As part of the Merger, Tenneco $740 and $450 preferred stock the
Preferred Stock was acquired by El Paso in exchange for El Paso common
stock. Consequently the $740 and $450 preferred stock dividends have been
subtracted from discontinued operations to compute basic and diluted earnings
per share. Before the Merger, Tenneco made periodic accretions of the excess
of the redemption value over the fair value of the Preferred Stock at the date
of issue. Such accretions have been included in the statements of income
caption, Preferred stock dividends as a reduction of net income to arrive at
net income to common stock.
In connection with the Transaction and as part of the Debt Realignment, Old
Tenneco issued the NPS Preferred Stock in November 1996 for proceeds of
approximately $296 million. The proceeds from the issuance were used to fund a
portion of the cash tender offers made in connection with the Debt Realignment
and other cash requirements preceding the Merger. As a result of the Merger,
the obligations relating to the NPS Preferred Stock remained with Old Tenneco.

10. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Tenneco has postretirement health care and life insurance plans that cover
substantially all of its domestic employees. For salaried employees, the plans
cover employees retiring from Tenneco on or after attaining age 55 who have
had at least 10 years service with Tenneco after attaining age 45. For hourly
employees, the postretirement benefit plans generally cover employees who
retire according to one of Tenneco hourly employee retirement plans. All of
these benefits may be subject to deductibles, copayment provisions, and other
limitations, and Tenneco has reserved the right to change these benefits.
Tenneco postretirement benefit plans are not funded.

The initial weighted average assumed health care cost trend rate used in
determining the 1997, 1996, and 1995 accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 5%, 6%, and 7%, respectively, remaining at 5% thereafter.
Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage-point
in each year would increase the 1997, 1996, and 1995 accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations by approximately $14 million, $13 million,
60

and $12 million, respectively, and would increase the aggregate of the service
cost and interest cost components of the net postretirement benefit cost for
1997, 1996, and 1995 by approximately $2 million, $2 million, and $1 million,
respectively.
The discount rate which is based on long-term market rates used in
determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 775% for
1997, 1996, and 1995.
11. PENSION PLANS
Tenneco has retirement plans that cover substantially all of its employees.
Benefits are based on years of service and, for most salaried employees, on
final average compensation. Tenneco funding policies are to contribute to
the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirement of federal laws
and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of listed equity and fixed
income securities. Also included in the table below are pension obligations
and assets retained by Tenneco related to certain employees of Tenneco
discontinued operations.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Commitments
Tenneco estimates that expenditures aggregating approximately $380 million
will be required after December 31, 1997, to complete facilities and projects
authorized at such date, and substantial commitments have been made in
connection therewith.
Lease Commitments
Tenneco holds certain of its facilities, equipment, and other assets under
long-term leases. The minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating
leases with lease terms in excess of one year are $135 million, $123 million 110 million, $104 million, and $50 million for the years 1998, 1999, 2000,
2001, and 2002, respectively, and $233 million for subsequent years. Of these
amounts, $78 million for 1998, $78 million for 1999, $78 million for 2000, $77
million for 2001, $27 million for 2002, and $74 million for subsequent years
are lease payment commitments to financial investors the Lessor for
certain mill and timberlands assets.
Following the initial mill asset lease period, Tenneco may, under the
provisions of the lease agreements, extend the leases on terms mutually
negotiated with the Lessor or purchase the leased assets under conditions
specified in the lease agreements. If the purchase options are not exercised
or the leases are not extended, Tenneco will make a residual guarantee payment
to the Lessor of approximately $658 million, which will be refunded up to the
total amount of the residual guarantee payment based on the Lessor
subsequent sales price for the leased assets. Throughout the lease period,
Tenneco is required to maintain the leased properties.
65
TENNECO INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
In January 1997, Tenneco refinanced two mill asset leases resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $38 million which is included in the caption Other income,
net.
Commitments under capital leases were not significant to the accompanying
financial statements. Total rental expense for continuing operations for the
years 1997, 1996, and 1995, was $163 million, $179 million, and $171 million,
respectively, including minimum rentals under non-cancelable operating leases
of $155 million, $151 million, and $148 million for the corresponding periods.
Tenneco Packaging various lease agreements require that it comply with
certain covenants and restrictions, including financial ratios that, among
other things, place limitations on incurring additional funded debt as
defined by the agreements. Under the provisions of the timber lease
agreements, in order to incur funded debt, Tenneco Packaging must maintain a
pre-tax cash flow coverage ratio, as defined, on a cumulative four quarter
basis of a minimum of 20, subsequently modified to 125 through December 31,
1996. Tenneco Packaging was in compliance with all of its covenants at
December 31, 1997.
Litigation
Tenneco Inc. and Newport News have received letters from the Defense
Contract Audit Agency the DCAA, inquiring about certain aspects of the
Distributions, including the disposition of the Tenneco Inc. Retirement Plan
TRP and the 1986 asset valuation for the TRP and its cost accounting
treatment. The DCAA has been advised that i the TRP will retain the
liability for all benefits accrued by the Newport News salaried employees
through December 31, 1996, ii the Newport News salaried employees will not
accrue additional benefits under the TRP after December 31, 1996, and iii no
liabilities or assets of the TRP will be transferred from the TRP to any plan
maintained by Newport News. A determination of the ratio of assets to
liabilities of the TRP attributable to Newport News will be based on facts,
assumptions, and legal issues that are complicated and uncertain; however, it
is likely that the U.S. Government will assert a claim against Newport News
with respect to the amount, if any, by which the assets of the TRP
attributable to its employees are alleged to exceed the liabilities. Tenneco,
with the full cooperation of Newport News, will defend against any claim by
the U.S. Government, and in the event there is a determination that an amount
is due to the U.S. Government, Tenneco and Newport News will share the
obligation for such amount plus the amount of related defense expenses, in the
ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. At this preliminary stage, it is
impossible to predict with certainty any eventual outcome regarding this
matter; however, Tenneco does not believe that this matter will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal
proceedings arising from their operations. Tenneco believes that the outcome
of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will have no material
effect on the financial position or results of operations of Tenneco Inc. and
its subsidiaries.
Environmental Matters
Tenneco Inc. and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of environmental
and pollution control laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which they
operate. Tenneco has provided reserves for compliance with these laws and
regulations where it is probable that a liability exists and where Tenneco can
make a reasonable estimate of the liability. The estimated liabilities
recorded are subject to change as more information becomes available regarding
the magnitude of possible clean-up costs and the timing, varying costs, and
effectiveness of alternative clean-up technologies. However, Tenneco believes
that any additional costs which arise as more information becomes available
will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of Tenneco.
