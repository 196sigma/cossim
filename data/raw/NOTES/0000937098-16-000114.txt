DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of BusinessTriNet Group, Inc. the Company or TriNet, a Delaware corporation incorporated in January 2000, provides comprehensive human resources, or HR, solutions for small to midsize businesses, or SMBs, across a number of industries under a co-employment model. The Companys HR solutions are designed to manage an increasingly complex set of HR regulations, costs, risks and responsibilities for its clients, allowing them to focus on operating and growing their core businesses. These HR solutions include bundled services, such as multi-state payroll processing and tax administration, employee benefits programs, including health insurance and retirement plans, workers compensation insurance and claims management, federal, state and local labor, employment and benefit law compliance, risk mitigation, expense and time management, human capital consulting and other services.The Company provides its services through co-employment relationships with its clients, under which the Company and its clients each take responsibility for certain portions of the employer-employee relationship for worksite employees WSEs. The Company is the employer of record for most administrative and regulatory purposes, including the following: i compensation through wages and salaries; ii employer payroll-related taxes payment; iii employee payroll-related taxes withholding and payment; iv employee benefit programs including health and life insurance, and others; and v workers compensation coverage. The client is responsible for responsibilities not assumed by the Company, including the day-to-day job responsibilities of the WSEs.Segment InformationThe Company operates in onereportable segment in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ASC 280 Segment Reporting, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. All of the Companys service revenues are generated from external clients. Less than 1%of revenue is generated outside of the United States of America U.S. Substantially all of the Companys long-lived assets are located in the U.S.Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated balance sheets, the consolidated statement of stockholdersequity deficit, the consolidated statement of cash flows and Note 3 have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets present the current assets and current liabilities directly related to the processing of human resources transactions as WSE-related assets and WSE-related liabilities, respectively. WSE-related assets consist of cash and investments restricted for current workers compensation claim payments, payroll funds collected, accounts receivable, unbilled service revenues, and refundable or prepaid amounts related to the Company-sponsored workers compensation and health plan programs. WSE-related liabilities consist of client prepayments, wages and payroll taxes accrued and payable, and liabilities related to the Company-sponsored workers compensation and health plan programs resulting from workers compensation case reserves, premium amounts due to providers for enrolled employees, and workers compensation and health reserves that are expected to be disbursed within the next 12 months. Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates include, but are not limited to, allowances for accounts receivable, workers compensation-related assets and liabilities, health plan assets and liabilities, recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation and other contingent liabilities. Such estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that Company management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates64Revenue Recognition Professional service revenues represent fees charged to clients for processing HR transactions on behalf of the Companys clients, such as payroll payments and remitting employment tax withholding amounts, providing access to the Companys HR expertise, including HR templates, best practices, and interactions with our HR professionals, providing labor, employment and benefit law compliance services to assist clients in avoiding or reducing liability and exposure and providing additional services, including recruiting or other services, to support various stages of clients growth. Professional service revenues are recognized in the period the services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.Insurance service revenues consist of insurance-related billings and administrative fees collected from clients and withheld from WSEs for Company-sponsored, risk-based, fully-insured insurance plans provided through third-party insurance carriers, primarily employee health benefit insurance and workers compensation insurance. Insurance service revenues are recognized in the period amounts are due and collectability is reasonably assured.The professional service revenues and insurance service revenues are each considered separate units of accounting and the associated fees and insurance premiums are billed as such for the majority of the Companys clients. For clients billed through a bundled invoice, the selling price of significant deliverables is determined based on the best estimate of the selling price. The Company is not the primary obligor for payroll and payroll tax payments and, therefore, these payments are not reflected as either revenue or expense. The gross payroll and payroll tax payments made on behalf of the clients, combined, were $306 billion, $256 billionand $176 billionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. The Company records a liability relating to work performed by WSEs but unpaid at the end of each period in the period in which the WSEs perform work, along with the related receivable for the same period. The Company generally charges an upfront non-refundable set-up fee for which the performance of onboarding services is not a discrete earnings event, and therefore the revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated average client tenure. Insurance Costs Insurance premiums paid to the insurance carriers for the insurance coverage for clients and WSEs and the reimbursements paid to the insurance carriers or third-party administrators for claims payments made on the Companys behalf within its insurance deductible layer, where applicable, are included in cost and operating expenses as insurance costs.Workers Compensation Insurance Reserves Workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated ultimate costs of paying claims within the deductible layer in accordance with workers compensation insurance policies. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus amounts for those claims incurred but not paid, and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims. In establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves, the Company uses an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims. In the Company experience, plan years related to workers compensation programs may take up to 10years or more to be settled.In estimating these reserves, the Company utilizes historical loss experience, exposure data, and actuarial judgment, together with a range of inputs which are primarily based upon the WSE job responsibilities, their location, the historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. All of these components could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements. For each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into the workers compensation claims cost estimates. Accordingly, final claim settlements may vary materially from the present estimates, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of workers compensation insurance reserves. Adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is identified. Such adjustments could be significant, reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends. Any unexpected increases in the severity or frequency of claims could result in material adverse effects to the operating results. The Company does not discount loss reserves accrued under these programs. Claim costs expected to be paid within one year are recorded as accrued workers compensation costs and included in short-term worksite employee related liabilities or 65short term worksite related assets if funds are held by third parties to cover the claims, while costs expected to be paid beyond one year are included in long-term liabilities or long term workers compensation receivables if funds are held by third parties to cover the claims on the consolidated balance sheets. Assets held by third parties to cover claim liabilities remain restricted until the plan year to which they relate are settled.At policy inception, annual premiums are estimated based on projected wages over the duration of the policy period. As actual wages are realized, the amounts paid for premiums may differ from the estimates recorded by the Company, creating an asset or liability throughout the policy year. Such differences could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. Health Benefits Health benefits insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of reimbursing the carriers for paying claims within the deductible layer in accordance with health insurance policies. These reserves include estimates for reported losses, plus estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Reserves are determined regularly by the Company based upon a number of factors, including but not limited to actuarial calculations, current and historical claims payment patterns, plan enrollment and medical trend rates. Ultimate health insurance reserves may vary in subsequent years from the amounts estimated. As of December31, 2015and 2014, liability reserves of $1132 millionand $821 million, respectively, were recorded within health benefits payable and are included in WSE-related liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under certain contracts, based on plan performance, the Company may be entitled to receive refunds of premiums. We estimate these refunds based on premium and claims data and record these within prepaid health plan expenses and are included in WSE-related assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December31, 2015and 2014, the Company had $68 millionand $49 million, respectively, as prepaid health plan expenses included within WSE-related assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include bank deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments. Investments with original maturity dates of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts from the date of purchase to maturity or sale. Such amortization is included in interest income as an addition to or deduction from the coupon interest earned on the investments. The Company uses the specific identification method of determining the cost basis in computing realized gains and losses on the sale of its available-for-sale securities. Realized gains and losses are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company assesses whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. With respect to debt securities, this assessment takes into account our current intent to sell, or not sell, the security, and whether it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. Accounts Receivable The Companys accounts receivable, which represent outstanding gross billings to clients, are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of clients, current economic conditions and other factors that may affect clients ability to pay, and charges off amounts when they are deemed uncollectible. Property and Equipment The Company records property and equipment at historical cost and computes depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms, generally threeto fiveyears for software and office 66equipment, fiveto sevenyears for furniture and fixtures, and the shorter of the asset life or the remaining lease term for leasehold improvements. The Company expenses the cost of maintenance and repairs as incurred and capitalizes betterments. Internal Use Software The Company capitalizes internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage. Application development stage costs include license fees paid to third-parties for software use, software configuration, coding, and installation. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, typically ranging from threeto fiveyears, commencing when the software is placed into service. The Company expenses costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as general and administrative, overhead, maintenance and training costs, and costs that do not add functionality to existing systems. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, internally developed software costs capitalized were $112 million, $63 millionand $33 millionrespectively.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Companys goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit. Impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Companys business is largely homogeneous and, as a result, all goodwill is associated with the Companys onereportable segment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives include purchased client lists, trade names, developed technologies, and contractual agreements. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from twoto sixyears using either the straight-line method or an accelerated method. Intangible assets are reviewed for indicators of impairment at least annually and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Based on the results of the Companys reviews, noimpairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Annually, the Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit has declined below carrying value. This assessment considers various financial, macroeconomic, industry, and reporting unit specific qualitative factors. The Company performs its annual impairment testing in its fiscal fourth quarter. Based on the results of the Companys reviews, noimpairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less selling costs. Advertising Costs The Company expenses the costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and expenses the cost of running advertisements in the period in which the advertising space or airtime is used as sales and marketing expense. Advertising costs were $82 million, $73 million, and $75 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company has issued three types of stock-based awards to employees: restricted stock units, stock options and employee stock purchase plan. Compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is based on the fair value of common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense associated with stock options and employee stock purchase plan are based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Expense is recognized using a straight-line amortization method over the respective vesting period for awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Accordingly, stock-based compensation has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. When estimating forfeitures, the Company 67considers voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures. A tax benefit from stock-based compensation is recognized in equity to the extent that an incremental tax benefit is realized. Income Taxes The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for estimated future tax effects based on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes under current tax laws. Deferred tax expense results from the change in the net liability for deferred income taxes between periods. The Company maintains a reserve for uncertain tax positions. The Company evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return for recognition in its consolidated financial statements. Prior to recording the related tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements, the Company must conclude that tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, assuming those positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information. The benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the amount the Company expects to realize after examination by taxing authorities. If a tax position drops below the more likely than not standard, the benefit can no longer be recognized. Assumptions, judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes and in determining the expected benefit. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard could materially impact the Companys results of operations or financial position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash and restricted investments including payroll funds collected, accounts receivable, and amounts due from insurance carriers. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash and restricted investments including payroll funds collected principally in domestic financial institutions and performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions. The Companys exposure to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding these funds is limited to amounts currently held by the institution in excess of insured amounts. Under the terms of professional services agreements, clients agree to maintain sufficient funds or other satisfactory credit at all times to cover the cost of its current payroll, all accrued paid time off, vacation or sick leave balances, and other vested wage and benefit obligations for all their work site employees. The Company generally requires payment from its clients on or before the applicable payroll date. For certain clients, the Company requires an indemnity guarantee payment IGP supported by a letter of credit, bond, or a certificate of deposit from certain financial institutions. The IGP typically equals the total payroll and service fee for one average payroll period. As of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, oneclient accounted for 12%of accounts receivable. Noclient accounted for more than 10%of total revenues in the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013. Bad debt expense, net of recoveries was $20 million, $14 millionand $06 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02Leases. The amendment requires that lease arrangements longer than 12 months result in an entity recognizing an asset and liability. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The amendment addresses various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted only for certain provisions. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards the Simplification Initiative. The amendment requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendment is effective for 68fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in 2015 with retrospective application. See Note 11 for further details.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05IntangiblesGoodwill and OtherInternal-Use Software, as part of the Simplification Initiative. The amendment provides guidance to clarify the customers accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance in 2016. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03InterestImputation of Interest,as part of its Simplification Initiative. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. The Company expects to adopt this guidance in 2016. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing ConcernSubtopic 205-40,which addresses managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Managements evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued. The standard will be effective for the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect to adopt this guidance early and does not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12CompensationStock Compensation, which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to adopt this guidance in 2016.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date to annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption at the original effective date of December 15, 2016 is permitted. The amendments may be applied retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company has not yet selected a method of adoption and is currently evaluating the effect that the amendments will have on the consolidated financial statements69NOTE 2.

The purchase price for each business combination is allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the date of purchase. Purchase price in excess of the identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the aggregate purchase consideration resulted in intangible assets of$44 millionand goodwill of$04 million. The intangible assets have a useful life of 5years. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of strategic acquisitions considered to be a business since the respective date of the acquisition.

The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of unsuccessful completion of projects in progress, as well as monitoring events or changes in circumstances, which might suggest that impairment has occurred and recoverability should be evaluated. An impairment 72loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Due to significant changes in the extent and manner in which assets were expected to be used, the Company recognized losses of $04 million, $09 millionand $08 millionfor the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively, and included these charges in depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe Companys noncurrent restricted cash and investments include $631 millionof available-for-sale marketable securities and $387 millionof cash collateral at December31, 2015. The Companys restricted investments within WSE-related assets include $23 millionof certificates of deposit and $15 millionof available-for-sale marketable securities as of December31, 2015. The available-for-sale marketable securities as of December31, 2015and December31, 2014consist of the following in thousands:Amortized CostGross Unrealized GainsGross Unrealized LossesEstimated Fair ValueDecember31, 2015:U.S.  funds5004504Total  2014:U.S.  funds5006506Total  were norealized gains or losses for the year endedDecember31, 2015and 2014. As of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, the contractual maturities of the U.S. treasuries were oneto fouryears.As of December31, 2015, certain of the Companys U.S. treasuries were in an unrealized loss position. Unrealized losses are principally due to changes in interest rates. In analyzing an issuers financial condition, the Company considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and industry analysts reports. The fair value of these securities in an unrealized loss position represented 81%and 59%of the total fair value of all securities available for sale as of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, respectively, and their unrealized losses were $01 millionand de minimis as of December31, 2015and December31, 2014. As the Company has the ability and intent to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future as classified as available for sale, no decline was deemed to be other-than-temporary.Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company uses a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:Level Iobservable inputs such as quoted prices in active marketsLevel IIinputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectlyLevel IIIunobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which requires the Company to develop its own assumptionsThis hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value74The following table summarizes the Companys financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis in thousands:TotalFair ValueLevel ILevel IILevel IIIDecember31, 2015:Certificates of deposit$2,319$2,319$$U.S. treasuries64,09164,091Mutual  2014:Certificates of deposit$2,318$2,318$$U.S. treasuries50,08250,082Mutual funds506506Interest rate  were notransfers between Level I and Level II assets during the years December31, 2015or December31, 2014.As of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, certificates of deposit consisted of certificates of deposit held by domestic financial institutions, which are presented as restricted investments within WSE-related assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments not measured at fair value, including cash, restricted cash, WSE-related assets and liabilities, line of credit and accrued corporate wages, approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity, cash repayments or market interest rates of such instruments. The fair value of such financial instruments, other than cash and restricted cash, is determined using the income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The fair value of all of these instruments would be categorized as Level II of the fair value hierarchy, with the exception of cash and cash equivalents, which would be categorized as Level I.At December31, 2015and December31, 2014, the carrying value of the Companys notes payable of $4996 millionand $5449 million, respectively, approximated fair value. The estimated fair values of the Companys notes payable are considered a Level II valuation in the hierarchy for fair value measurement and are based on a cash flow model discounted at market interest rates that considers the underlying risks of unsecured debt.NOTE 8. NOTES PAYABLE AND BORROWINGS UNDER CAPITAL LEASESThe following schedule summarizes the components of the Companys notes payable and borrowings under capital leases balances in thousands:December31, 2015December31, 2014Notes payable under credit  leases153275Less current  March 2014, the proceeds from the Companys initial public offering IPO were used to fully repay its existing $1900 millionsecond lien credit facility, which resulted in a prepayment premium of $38 million, and to repay $250 millionof its existing first lien tranche B-1 term loan.

The tranche B term loans will be repaid in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1%of the principal amount thereof, with any remaining balance payable on the final maturity date of the tranche B term loans.The $750 millionrevolving credit facility includes capacity for a $400 millionletter of credit facility and a $100 millionswingline facility. The total unused portion of the revolving credit facility was $595 millionas of December31, 2015. In connection with the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company incurred $111 millionof debt issuance costs. The Company deferred $80 millionof the costs, which are being amortized over the term of the credit facility. The remaining $31 millionof costs were recorded to interest expense and bank fees. Additionally, the Company recorded a $90 millionloss on extinguishment of debt to write-off deferred issuance costs associated with the original first lien credit facility, which was also recorded to interest expense and bank fees. The remaining $61 millionof loan fees associated with the previous facility that was deemed to be modified continues to be amortized over the revised remaining term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.In March 2015, the Company repaid $250 millionof the tranche B term loan. As a result, a portion of the loan fees associated with the first lien credit facility was fully amortized in March 2015 for a charge of $04 million.The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among other things, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, prepayment of other indebtedness, and dividends and other distributions. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require the Company to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least 350to 100 and a maximum total leverage ratio of 425to 100 at December31, 2015.

In addition to these covenants, the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement requires, beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, the Company to prepay the tranche B term loan in an amount which is based on the specified excess cash flow percentage determined by the current leverage ratio. The Company recorded a current liability of $127 millionat December 31, 2015 in anticipation of this prepayment.

The undistributed earnings are allocated between common stock and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period.Basic EPS is calculated by taking net income, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common stock outstanding.Diluted EPS is calculated using the more dilutive of the if-converted method and the two-class method. Because the preferred stock participates in dividends on a pro rata basis as if the shares had been converted, the diluted earnings per share are the same under both methods. The two-class method has been presented below80The following table sets forth the computation of the Companys basic and diluted net income per share attributable to common stock in thousands, except per share data:Year Ended December 31,201520142013Numerator basicNet  net income allocated to participating securities2,2249,926Net income attributable to common  basicWeighted average shares of common stock  EPS$045$024$026Numerator dilutedNet  net income allocated to participating securities2,1149,303Net income attributable to common  dilutedWeighted average shares of common  effect of stock options and restricted stock units2,3903,4063,379Weighted average shares of common stock  EPS$044$022$024Common stock equivalents excluded from income per diluted share because of their anti-dilutive effect1,0045261,389Special Dividend In August 2013, the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $588per common-equivalent share for holders of record of the Companys preferred stock as of August21, 2013, or a total of $2236 million, and $588per share for holders of record of the Companys common stock as of August30, 2013, or a total of $871 million. These dividends were fully paid in August 2013 and September 2013. Dividends have also been declared to holders of restricted stock units at $588per share, or a total of $01 million, and are payable as the restricted stock units vest. In December 2013, the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $088per common-equivalent share for holders of record of the Companys preferred stock as of December25, 2013, or a total of $333 million, and $088per share for holders of record of the Companys common stock as of December25, 2013, or a total of $134 million. These dividends were fully paid in December 2013. Dividends have also been declared to holders of restricted stock units at $088per share and are payable as the restricted stock units vest. As a result of the August 2013 special dividend and in accordance with the provisions of the 2009 Plan, the Company adjusted the exercise prices on all outstanding options downward by $588, exactly equal to the amount of the dividend, except in three instances in which: i the exercise price was lower than $638, iithe holder of the incentive stock option under the 2009 Plan did not consent to the adjustment when consent was required, or iiithe incentive stock option was under the 2000 Plan. For options that were priced lower than $638, the Company adjusted the exercise price to $050. As a result of the December 2013 special dividend and in accordance with the provisions of the 2009 Plan, the Company adjusted the exercise prices on all outstanding options downward by $088, exactly equal to the amount of the dividend, except in three instances in which: i the exercise price was lower than $138, ii the holder of the incentive stock option under the 2009 Plan did not consent to the adjustment when consent was required, or iii the incentive stock option was under the 2000 Plan. For options that were priced lower than $275, the Company adjusted the exercise price to $050.No changes were made to the original option grant-date fair value for the purpose of recognizing ongoing stock-based compensation cost. No changes were made to nonvested restricted stock units. 81Stock Repurchases In May 2014, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $15 millionof our outstanding common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. In November 2014, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $30 millionstock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. These stock repurchase programs are intended to offset dilution resulting from the issuance of shares under the Companys ESPP and upon exercise of stock options. During 2014, the Company repurchased 490,419shares of outstanding common stock for $15 million. On June 29, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a $500 millionincremental increase to the Companys stock repurchase program. During the year endedDecember31, 2015, the Company repurchased 1,895,625shares of outstanding common stock for $484 million. Accordingly, as of December31, 2015, a total of approximately $316 millionremained available for further repurchases of the Companys common stock under the Companys stock repurchase program.Stock SplitOn March7, 2014, the Companys board of directors and stockholders approved and effected an amendment to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation providing for a 2-for-1 stock split of the outstanding common stock, which has been retroactively adjusted for all periods presented. NOTE 10. 401k PLAN Under the Companys 401k plan, corporate participants may direct the investment of contributions to their accounts among certain investments. The Company matches individual employee 401k plan contributions at the rate of $050for every dollar contributed by employees subject to a cap. The Company recorded matching contributions to the 401k plan of $46 million, $35 million, and $27 millionduring the years ended December31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, which are reflected in various operating expense lines within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company also maintains a multiple employer defined contribution plan, which covers WSEs for client companies electing to participate in the plan and for its internal staff employees. The Company contributes, on behalf of each participating client, varying amounts based on the clients policies and serviced employee elections. NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES The Company is subject to income taxation in the United States and Canada. However, business is conducted primarily in the United States. The effective income tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes, non-deductible stock-based compensation, and tax credits. The Company makes estimates and judgments about its future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with the Companys plans and estimates. Should the actual amounts differ from these estimates, the amount of the valuation allowance could be materially affected.Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are reflected as a component of provision for income taxes. 82Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31,20152014Deferred tax assets:Net operating losses federal and state$2,508$2,996Accrued expenses9,9089,381Accrued workers compensation costs18,82313,964Stock-based compensation4,6432,508Tax benefits relating to uncertain positions2920Tax credits federal and  allowance5,2766,945Total deferred tax assets37,02032,143Deferred tax liabilities:Depreciation and  service  health plan expenses3,1212,202Total deferred tax  non-current deferred tax  November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The Company elected to early adopt and retrospectively apply the provisions of the amendment which resulted in reclassification of the previously reported current deferred tax liability of $657 millionand noncurrent deferred tax asset of $72 millionto net against the noncurrent deferred tax liability for a total noncurrent deferred tax liability of $585 millionfor 2014.  The deferred tax assets and liabilities presented above are classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31,20152014Net current deferred tax liabilities$$Net non-current deferred tax  current deferred tax assetsNet non-current deferred tax assetsNet deferred tax  provision for income taxes consists of the following in thousands: Year Ended December  due to state legislative  U.S. federal statutory income tax rate reconciled to the Companys effective tax rate is as follows: Year Ended December 31,201520142013U.S. federal statutory tax rate3500%3500%3500%State income taxes, net of federal benefit663838Tax rate change527815Nondeductible transaction costs09Nondeductible meals, entertainment and penalties334341Stock-based  tax positions020823Tax  effective income tax rate decreased from 532%for 2014to 472%for 2015. The decrease is primarily due to disqualifying dispositions on previously non-deductible stock-based compensation and tax credits offset in part by increased state taxes of 28%due to state legislative changes. Revaluation of deferred taxes due to state legislative changes resulted in discrete tax expense representing 52%, 78%and 15%of the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The benefit in other tax expense of 22%is primarily attributable to adjustments to state net operating losses resulting from state legislative changes.   The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce reported deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, both positive and negative, for each respective tax jurisdiction, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $06 millionand $19 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively, related to certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards that may not be utilized prior to expiration. The Company has federal and multiple state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $01 millionand $608 million, respectively, as of December31, 2015. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2031and the state net operating loss carryforward will begin expiring in 2016. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Accordingly, a companys ability to use net operating losses may be limited as prescribed under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 IRC Section 382. Events which may cause limitations in the amount of the net operating losses that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50% over a 84three-year period. Due to the effects of historical equity issuances, the Company has determined that the future utilization of a portion of its net operating losses is limited annually pursuant to IRC Section 382. As of December31, 2015, the Company has determined that a portion of its state net operating losses in the amount of $27 million, will expire because of the annual limitation. The Company has excluded excess windfall tax benefits resulting from stock option exercises as components of the Companys gross deferred tax assets, as tax attributes related to such windfall tax benefits should not be recognized until they result in a reduction of taxes payable. The gross amount of unrealized net operating loss carryforwards for state resulting from stock option exercises was $141 millionat December31, 2015. When realized, excess windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid-in capital. The provision for income taxes for the year ended December31, 2015included $207 millionof excess tax benefit resulting from stock option exercises and net operating loss carryforward utilization. The Company follows the tax law ordering method to determine when such net operating loss carryforwards have been realized.The Company has $65 millionnet of federal benefit state tax credit carryforwards available that will begin expiring in 2021, which are partially offset by a valuation allowance of $47 millionand $50 millionas of December31, 2015and 2014, respectively. Provision for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2015and 2014included a tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards of $39 millionand $243 million, respectively. The valuation allowance decreased by $17 millionas of December31, 2015. The valuation allowance increased by $18 millionand $37 millionas of December 31, 2014and 2013, respectively. The Company is subject to tax in U.S. federal and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as Canada. The Company is not subject to any material income tax examinations in federal or state jurisdictions for tax years beginning prior to January 1, 2011. The Company paid Notices of Proposed Assessments disallowing employment tax credits totaling $105 millionin connection with the IRS examination of Gevity HR, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which was acquired by TriNet in June 2009. The Company plans to exhaust all administrative efforts to resolve this matter, however, it is likely that the matter will ultimately be resolved through litigation. With regard to these employment tax credits, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the Company will prevail.Therefore, no reserve has been recognized related to this matter. As of December31, 2015and 2014, the total unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain income tax positions, which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized, were $33 millionand $32 million, respectively. As of December31, 2015, the amount of the total unrecognized tax benefits for which it was reasonably possible such benefits could settle within the next year was de minimis. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties is as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31,201520142013Unrecognized tax benefits at  for tax positions of prior periods25Additions for tax positions of current period167182286Reductions for tax positions of prior period:Settlements with taxing authorities406Lapse of applicable statute of limitations290Adjustments to tax positions2036Unrecognized tax benefits at  Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of December31, 2015and December31, 2014, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $08 millionand $08 million, respectively. In connection with tax matters, the Company recognized de minimis interest and penalty expense related to its uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively. The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on its Canadian subsidiarys undistributed earnings of $26 millionas of December31, 2015, because the Company intends to reinvest such earnings 85indefinitely. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits. Determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the Company investment in its Canadian subsidiary that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicable. We currently intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the U.S. NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESLease CommitmentsThe Company leases office facilities, including its headquarters and other facilities, and equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. The Company also leases certain software and furniture, fixtures, and equipment under capital leases. The schedule of minimum future rental payments under non-cancelable operating and capital leases having initial terms in excess of one year at December31, 2015, is as follows in thousands: Capital LeasesOperating LeasesYear ending December  lease payments268$50,323Less current portion of minimum lease payments37Less interest115Long term portion of capital leases$116The lease agreements generally provide for rental payments on a graduated basis and for options to renew, which could increase future minimum lease payments if exercised. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period and accrues for rent expense incurred but not paid. Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014and 2013was $129 million, $119 millionand $99 million, respectively. Sublease income to be received under non-cancelable subleases for the years ending December31, 2016 and 2017, is $03 millionand de minimis, respectively. Operating CovenantsTo meet various states licensing requirements and maintain accreditation by the Employer Services Assurance Corporation, the Company is subject to various minimum working capital and net worth requirements. As of December31, 2015and 2014, the Company believes it has fully complied in all material respects with all applicable state regulations regarding minimum net worth, working capital and all other financial and legal requirements. Further, the Company has maintained positive working capital throughout the period covered by the financial statements.ContingenciesOn or about August 7, 2015, Howard Welgus, a purported stockholder of the Company, filed a putative securities class action lawsuit arising under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The case has not been certified as a class action, although it purports to be filed on behalf of purchasers of the Companys common stock between May 5, 2014 and August 3, 2015, inclusive. The name of the case is Welgus v. TriNet Group, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-03625. No stockholder other than Mr. Welgus submitted a motion for appointment as lead plaintiff to represent the putative class, and, on December 3, 2015, the Court appointed Mr. Welgus as lead plaintiff. On February 1, 2016, Mr. Welgus filed an amended complaint. The defendants named in the case are the Company and certain of its officers and directors, as well as General Atlantic, LLC, a significant shareholder, and formerly majority shareholder, of the Company. The amended complaint generally alleges that the Company caused damage to stockholders of the Company by misrepresenting and/or failing to disclose facts generally pertaining to alleged trends affecting health insurance and workers compensation claims. Under a stipulated briefing schedule approved by the Court, the Company intends to move to dismiss the amended complaint no later than April 11, 2016. The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses against this action and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against the allegations of Mr. Welgus86The Company is and, from time to time, has been and may in the future become involved in various litigation matters, legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business, including disputes with its clients or various class action, collective action, representative action and other proceedings arising from the nature of its co-employment relationship with its clients and WSEs in which the Company is named as a defendant. In addition, due to the nature of the Companys co-employment relationship with its clients and WSEs, the Company could be subject to liability for federal and state law violations, even if the Company does not participate in such violations. While the Companys agreements with its clients contain indemnification provisions related to the conduct of its clients, the Company may not be able to avail itself of such provisions in every instance. While the outcome of the matters described above cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently does not believe that any such claims or proceedings or the above mentioned securities class action will have a materially adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, the unfavorable resolution of any particular matter or the Companys reassessment of its exposure for any of the above matters based on additional information obtained in the future could have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, the above matters, individually and in the aggregate, could have an adverse impact on the Company because of diversion of management resources and other factors.NOTE 13.

Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2015. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December31, 2015, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.However, giving full consideration to these weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; andprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015was not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report dated March [15], 2016, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K89Ineffective information technology IT general controls Our management determined that several control deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness exist related to the design and operating effectiveness of our IT general controls ITGCs for certain of our key information systems, including our enterprise resource planning ERP systems and payroll systems, that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and system of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, these deficiencies also impact the ability to rely on related interfaces, application controls and reports generated by the systems with ineffective ITGCs. The ineffective design and operation of our ITGCs impacts all of our significant financial statement accounts and disclosures. The deficiencies related to the design and operating effectiveness of our ITGCs fell into the three main categories listed below: Computer OperationsDesign and operating effectiveness of our system of controls related to the monitoring of batch processing and system interfaces to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data movement involving our ERP system and certain payroll systems that process revenue transactions were identified as having deficiencies. Access ControlsDesign and operating effectiveness of our controls to ensure that access to applications and data were adequately restricted to appropriate personnel were identified as having deficiencies. These deficiencies impact a number of our systems that process internal and revenue-generating payroll transactions, fixed assets, stock option and restricted stock unit information, procurement authorizations, insurance expenses, insurance reserves and payroll taxes. Change ManagementDesign and operating effectiveness of controls to monitor program change management procedures, including monitoring the activities of individuals who have authority and have been granted access to make changes to programs, were identified as having deficiencies. These deficiencies impacted systems that process procurement authorizations and accumulate claims data that is utilized to estimate workers compensation liabilities.Ineffective control environment and risk assessmentOur management determined that a material weakness exists due to a lack of a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training commensurate with our structure, internal control, and financial reporting requirements. Additionally, we did not have an adequate process in place to complete our testing and assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner.Ineffective management review controls and controls over system-generated reportsOur management determined that several control deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness exist related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls to ensure that key spreadsheets and system-generated reports were properly reviewed for completeness and accuracy. For certain management review controls, controls verifying the accuracy of underlying data used to perform these reviews were not performed or adequately documented. In addition, certain management review controls were not performed at a sufficiently precise level to identify errors that could aggregate to a material misstatement of the financial statements. These deficiencies impact substantially all of our significant financial statement accounts.Ineffective controls over payroll operationsOur management determined that several control deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness exist related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over the accuracy of certain information that we manually input into the payroll systems and that is used in the processing of payroll for customers. Manually input information includes contractual terms, bill rates, benefit elections and other wage data. Controls identified to prevent or detect inappropriate changes to payroll information and resolve payroll processing errors were not effectively designed to detect material errors. Additionally, management identified deficiencies related to the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the reconciliation of benefit enrollment data between the Companys payroll systems and the insurance carriers records. The deficiencies impact amounts recorded as professional and insurance service revenues, operating expenses, accrued corporate wages, and worksite employee related assets and liabilities. 90Ineffective controls over health and workers compensation liabilities and related expensesOur management determined that several control deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness exist related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls to validate the completeness and accuracy of data utilized in calculating health and workers compensation liabilities and related expenses, including premium expenses and administrative fees. Data utilized includes enrollment counts, cost rates, wage data, claim counts and incurred and paid claim amounts. Certain reconciliations of claim payments per the Companys actuarial analyses to actual amounts paid were not operating effectively. Additionally, controls over the review of health premium expenses did not operate at a level of precision that would detect material errors. These deficiencies impact insurance costs, workers compensation receivables, workers compensation liabilities, and worksite employee related assets and liabilities. Ineffective controls over validating accuracy of payroll tax liabilitiesOur management determined that several control deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness exist related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls to validate the accuracy and completeness of tax rates input into our payroll systems, including reconciliation to the general ledger of the payroll taxes payable account at a sufficient level of detail. In addition, due to the ineffective ITGCs over the system that calculates payroll tax withholdings, compensating controls identified are not sufficiently precise to prevent or detect errors in the amounts recorded as payroll tax liabilities for internal employees and WSEs.Ineffective authorization controls over procurement processesOur management determined that a material weakness exists related to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over the initial set up and changes to designated approvers over corporate purchases, including purchasing card limits, expense reimbursements or approving new vendors added to the procurement system. 91REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders of TriNet Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited TriNet Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework, the COSO criteria. TriNet Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses have been identified in the following categories and included in managements assessment:Ineffective information technology IT general controlsIneffective control environment and risk assessmentIneffective management review controls and controls over system-generated reportsIneffective controls over payroll operationsIneffective controls over health and workers compensation liabilities and related expensesIneffective controls over validating accuracy of payroll tax liabilitiesIneffective authorization controls over procurement processesWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the 2015 consolidated financial statements. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2015 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March31, 2016which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, TriNet Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria./s/ Ernst Young LLPSan Francisco, CaliforniaMarch31, 201692Additional Analyses and Procedures and Remediation PlanAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, we performed additional analyses and other procedures in order to prepare the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the material weaknesses described above create a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after extensive review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required. In addition, we are taking specific steps, as further described below, to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management and described in greater detail in the preceding section. Although we intend to complete the remediation process with respect to these material weaknesses as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our remediation plan may not prove to be successful. With respect to the remediation of our ineffective IT general controls, we are taking a number of steps, which include, but are not limited to:designing, adopting or implementing IT governance policies, procedures and general controls across all technology platforms;improving the design and operation of control activities and procedures associated with monitoring of batch processing and system interfaces to ensure the completeness and accuracy of data movement;establishing a more comprehensive review and approval process for authorizing user access to IT systems , including both preventive and detective control activities;improving the design and operation of program change management control activities such as change management control setting configurations across the affected IT systems, including tracking of access and history of change; andaugmenting and hiring additional IT resources and professionals.We are also working to integrate our technology platforms and ERP systems to reduce the number of redundant business processes. For example, we completed the integration of our Ambrose technology platform as of February 29, 2016 and we currently expect to complete the integration of our Accord technology platform by the end of 2016.With respect to the remediation in other areas, we are taking a number of steps, which include, but are not limited to:defining and assessing the control deficiency for each of the material weaknesses to ensure a thorough understanding of the as-is state, identify relevant process owners, and define and address gaps in the control deficiency;designing and evaluating a remediation plan for each of the material weaknesses to validate or improve the related policy and procedures, assess and improve skills of the process owners with regards to the policy and make necessary adjustments as required;implementing the remediation plan for each of the material weaknesses and training process owners, evaluating process adoption and monitoring results;testing and measuring the design and effectiveness of the remediation plan, and the updated controls; management review and acceptance of the remediation effort; andaugmenting and hiring additional accounting, actuarial, finance and internal audit resources and professionals.We believe that the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weaknesses identified above. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation of these material weaknesses will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective and there is no assurance that additional remediation steps will not be necessary. As such, as we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, our management may decide to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or modify the remediation steps described above. As noted above, although we plan to complete the remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our initiatives may not prove to be successful. Accordingly, until these weaknesses are remediated, we plan to perform additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. 93Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOther than the identification of the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15d and 15d-15d of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2015, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Item9B.
