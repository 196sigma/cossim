Item 8.
From time to time, the Company evaluates potential acquisitions of products,
businesses and technologies that would complement or expand the Company
business. The Company currently does not have any commitments or agreements with
respect to any such acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any such
acquisitions will be made or, if made, will be successfully integrated. The
Company has also engaged a financial advisor to assist it in assessing strategic
alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Factors Affecting Future Operating Results
In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company is providing the following cautionary
statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company actual
results to differ materially from its historical operating results and from
those projected in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the
Company.
The Company wishes to caution readers that the following important factors,
among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, the
Company actual results and could cause the Company future actual results to
differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made
by, or on behalf of, the Company. General Business and Economic Conditions
General business and economic conditions have an impact on the Company
financial results. The Company customer base, which is largely retailers and
distributors for resale to retailers, may be impacted by weak economic
conditions and, as a result, may reduce required inventory levels of products
purchased from the Company. The Company customers are not contractually
required to make future purchases of the Company products and therefore could
discontinue carrying the Company products in favor of a competitor products
or for any other reason. The Company financial results could be affected by
the size and rate of growth of the consumer software market and consumer PC
market. The consumer software business is seasonal due primarily to the
increased demand for consumer software during the year-end holiday buying
season. General business and economic conditions and consumer confidence may
impact retail sales of consumer software. Currency fluctuations associated with
international sales and accounts receivable may also affect the Company
financial results.
Competition
The market for the Company products is intensely and increasingly competitive.
Existing consumer software companies may broaden their product lines to compete
with the Company products and potential new competitors, including computer
hardware and software manufacturers, diversified media companies and book
publishing companies, may enter or increase their focus on the consumer software
market, resulting in even greater competition for the Company. There has been a
consolidation among competitors in the market for the Company products, and
many of the companies with which the Company currently competes or may compete
in the future have greater financial, technical, marketing, sales and customer
support resources, as well as greater name recognition and better access to
consumers, than the Company. The competition for retail space is also likely to
increase due to the proliferation of consumer software products and companies.
Dependence on Retailers and Distributors
Retailers and distributors compete in a volatile industry that is subject to
rapid change, consolidation, financial difficulty and increasing competition
from new distribution channels. Due to increased competition for limited shelf
space, retailers and distributors are increasingly in a better position to
negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, promotional
support and product return policies. The Company financial results may be
impacted by the accuracy of retailers' forecasts of consumer demand, the timing
of the receipt of orders from major customers, account cancellations or delays
in shipment, competitors' marketing strategies and promotions, changes in
pricing strategies by the Company or its competitors and the collectibility of
accounts receivable. Furthermore, a significant portion of sales within a
quarter is typically not realized until late in that quarter. As a result, it
may be difficult for the Company to predict is net revenues for the quarter or
to quickly adapt its spending levels within a quarter to reflect changes in
demand for its products.
Uncertainty of Market Acceptance; Changes in Technology and Industry
Standards
The consumer software industry is undergoing rapid changes, including evolving
industry standards, frequent product introductions and changes in consumer
requirements and preferences. Consumer preferences are difficult to predict, and
few consumer products achieve sustained market acceptance. The Company
financial results will be impacted by market acceptance of the Company
products and those of its competitors, development and promotional expenses
relating to the introduction of new products, new versions of existing products
or new operating systems, evolving distribution channels, and the growth in
popularity of the Internet and other new technologies which could impact the
distribution and purchase of software.
Other Factors
In addition to the important factors discussed above, the Company financial
results, financial position and cash flows may be impacted by, among other
factors, future cash flow and working capital requirements, implementation and
expansion of the Company systems and operations to accommodate the Company
anticipated future revenues, the outcome of current and future examinations by
taxing authorities, and the acquisitions of new businesses by the Company and
related charges and write-offs. The market price of the Company Common Stock
has been, and in the future will likely be, subject to significant fluctuations
in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors, such
as announcements of technological innovations or new products by the Company or
its competitors, or other events. The Year 2000 Issue
The Company does not believe that it has material exposure to the Year 2000
issue with respect to its own information system as the supplier of its primary
systems has an updated release of the Company applications software that
correctly identifies the year 2000. The Company plans to implement the new
release beginning in 1998 and to complete the implementation before the fourth
quarter of 1999. However, there can be no assurance that this software
implementation will be successfully completed, or that the implementation will
not have a material adverse impact on the Company financial results, financial
position and cash flows. The Company is seeking to determine if the information
systems of its major customers and vendors insofar as they relate to the
Company business comply with Year 2000 requirements, and there can be no
assurance that the Year 2000 issue will not affect the information systems of
the Company major customers and vendors as they relate to the Company
business, or that any such impact of a major customer or vendor information
system would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data         INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                   Page

Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1997.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Expert Software,
Inc. and subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 1997 and 1996
1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Organization Expert Software, Inc. the Company publishes and distributes computer
software under the Expert trade name. The Company products address a broad
range of consumer interest and everyday tasks for the productivity, lifestyle,
small office/home office, entertainment and education market categories. The
Company titles are primarily available on the Windows operating system, and
substantially all are available on CD-ROM. The Company sells its products
directly to retailers, as well as to distributors.
Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Swfte International, Ltd. Swfte
and ES International, Inc. All intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements
approximate fair value.
Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investment instruments with a maturity
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
include investments in repurchase agreements and tax-exempt bond instruments.
Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk Accounts receivable are principally from retailers and distributors of the
Company products. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its
customers and maintains allowances for potential credit losses and potential
returns of  $4,361,000  and  $5,061,000 at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
The Company customers are invoiced upon shipment, at which time a provision is
recorded for expected future returns. The Company estimates returns based on
management evaluation of historical experience and current industry trends and
charges such estimates against gross revenues. Retailers and distributors
compete in a volatile industry that is subject to rapid change, consolidation,
financial difficulty and increasing competition from new distribution channels.
Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors
are increasingly in a better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale,
including price discounts, promotional support and product return policies. The
Company financial results may be impacted by the accuracy of retailers'
forecasts of consumer demand, the timing of the receipt of orders from major
customers, account cancellations or delays in shipment, competitors' marketing
strategies and promotions, changes in pricing strategies by the Company or its
competitors and the collectibility of accounts receivable. Furthermore, a
significant portion of sales within a quarter is typically not realized until
late in that quarter. As a result, it may be difficult for the Company to
predict its net revenues for the quarter or to quickly adapt its spending levels
within a quarter to reflect changes in demand for its products. Sales to the Company customers which represented 10% or more of gross sales
less actual returns in any of the periods shown below are as follows                Years Ended December 31,
1997    1996    1995
Customer A.  152%   196%   116%
Customer B.   45    104   144
Customer C.   48    78   113 The two major customers at December 31, 1997 and 1996 also account for 105% and
221% of gross outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
Inventories Inventories, which consist primarily of software media, manuals and related
packaging materials, are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost
determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis. Management performs periodic
assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and nonsalable
inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to net
realizable value.
During the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 the Company had one supplier
which accounted for approximately 428% and 328%, respectively, of total
purchases. A second supplier accounted for 223% of total purchases in 1997.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense includes the
amortization of capital lease assets.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred; betterments are
capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized
currently.
Revenue Recognition Sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped, net of allowances for
returns, in accordance with the provisions of the AICPA Statement of Position
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. While the Company has no other obligation
to perform future services subsequent to shipment, the Company provides
telephone customer support as an accommodation to purchasers of its products as
a means of fostering customer loyalty. Costs associated with this effort are
insignificant and immaterial to the financial statements, and accordingly, are
expensed as incurred.
Amortization Acquired software technology related to the 1995 acquisition of Swfte discussed
in Note 2 represents the fair value of certain software technology and licenses
acquired. The recorded value of $3,835,000 was based on independent appraisal
and was being amortized on a straight-line basis over two to two and one-half
years, the anticipated period of benefit. As discussed in Note 2, a loss on
impairment of these intangibles was recorded during the second quarter of 1996.
Additionally, amortization of $98,000 and $459,000 on these assets was recorded
during 1997 and 1996, respectively. Accumulated amortization on acquired
software technology totaled $4,454,000 and $3,672,000 at December 31, 1997 and
1996, respectively.
Royalties Royalties are accrued based on net revenues pursuant to agreements with external
software developers of software products published by the Company. Royalty
costs, which are included in cost of revenues, were $3,012,000, $2,715,000, and
$2,575,000  during the years ended  December 31, 1997,  1996 and 1995,
respectively. Software Development Costs In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 SFAS
86, Accounting for the Cost of Capitalized Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed, the Company examines its software development costs after
technological feasibility has been established to determine the amount of
capitalization that is required. For all periods presented herein, software
development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological
feasibility have been immaterial and therefore expensed as incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation Beginning in 1996, the Company implemented the provisions of SFAS 123,
Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  in accounting for stock-based
transactions with non-employees and accordingly records compensation expense in
the consolidated statements of operations for such transactions. The Company
continues to apply the provisions of APB 25 for transactions with employees, as
permitted by SFAS 123.
Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires that deferred income taxes be recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting basis at rates based on enacted tax
laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. Current income tax expense
represents the tax payable for the period. The deferred income tax expense
benefit represents the change during the period in the balance of deferred
taxes.
Earnings Per Share of Common Stock In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued
SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share. This statement simplifies the standards for
computing and presenting earnings per share EPS and makes them comparable to
international EPS standards. SFAS 128 replaces the presentation of primary EPS
with a presentation of basic EPS. It also requires dual presentation of basic
and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement for all entities with
complex capital structures. SFAS 128 became effective for financial statements
issued for periods after December 15, 1997 and requires restatement of all prior
periods presented. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of convertible
securities and dilutive common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method
of accounting. For periods in which the Company reports a loss from continuing
operations, diluted earnings per share do not include stock options as their
effect would be antidilutive.
2. ACQUISITION AND LOSS ON IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS In November 1995, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of
Swfte International, Ltd., a developer of consumer software for the education
and entertainment markets. Total consideration paid was $70 million in cash,
subject to post-closing adjustments, and 320,630 unregistered shares of the
Company common stock which were independently valued at approximately $44
million. Additionally, the Company assumed $13 million of Swfte bank debt
which was repaid by the Company subsequent to the consummation of the
transaction.
The acquisition of Swfte was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of Swfte since November 2, 1995 are
included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Based on an
independent appraisal, of the excess of purchase price over the fair value of
the net assets acquired, approximately $84 million or approximately 65% of the
purchase price was expensed during the Company 1995 fourth quarter as
incomplete purchased research and development projects that had not reached
technological feasibility as defined by SFAS No. 86.
Swfte assets and liabilities are included in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets at values representing an allocation of the purchase price,
adjusted in 1996 for the impairment of these assets discussed below. The aggregate purchase price was allocated based upon the fair value of the
tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities acquired, summarized as
follows in thousands                   
Current assets. $1,952
Equipment.   478
Purchased research and   
development.  8,392
Acquired intangibles.  4,498
Current liabilities. 1,951
Notes payable. 1,304
Total cost of      
acquisition. $12,065
During the second quarter of 1996, management reevaluated the carrying value of
the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of Swfte. This
reevaluation was necessitated by management determination based on recent
results of operations that the expected sales and cash flows from the acquired
assets would be substantially lower than had been previously expected by
management. Since these factors were not expected to be short-term or temporary
in nature, the carrying value of the intangible assets was reduced by $3,478,000
in accordance with SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. Management also determined that the
lower demand for the acquired products and claims from customers arising during
1996 for pre-acquisition cooperative marketing and price protection credits
required an additional  provision for returns of $1,065,000 higher than
originally provided on the acquired accounts receivable; and a provision for
reserves $150,000 higher than originally provided on the acquired inventories.
The lower than expected sales and higher than expected returns levels on the
acquired products indicate that the minimum royalties will not be recouped in
the ordinary course of business and $339,000 of such royalties were accrued as
part of the loss on impairment of intangibles during the second quarter.
Similarly, losses totaling $668,000 on fixed assets and certain other assets
determined to have lower values than originally assigned were accrued as part of
the loss on impairment of intangibles as of June 30, 1996. Such losses totaled
$5,700,000 and are reflected as Loss on impairment of assets in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

6. REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT
The Company has entered into a loan agreement with a bank also a shareholder of
the Company which provides for a revolving line of credit collateralized by
substantially all of the Company assets. Borrowings under the line of credit
are limited to a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the
agreement and may not exceed $5,000,000 through May 31, 1998, the maturity date.
Interest is payable at the bank base rate plus 15%. To date, there have been
no borrowings under the line.
The loan agreement contains restrictive covenants, including the achievement of
certain earnings, as defined in the agreement, and the maintenance of a minimum
net worth and various financial ratios. At December 31, 1997, the Company was in
compliance with the agreement.
7. COMMON STOCK In February 1995, in connection with its initial public offering, the Company
increased the amount of authorized common stock to 30,000,000 shares, authorized
the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of $01 par value, preferred stock and
increased the shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Company
1992 stock option plan to 2,250,000.
In April 1995, the Company completed an initial public offering of 3,105,000
shares of its common stock of which 1,700,000 were sold by the Company and
1,405,000 shares were offered by certain of the Company stockholders. The
offering price was $1200 per share and the proceeds to the Company, net of the
underwriters discount of $1,428,000, were $18,972,000. Costs associated with the
offering include legal, accounting and other direct costs of $1,017,000. The
Company used $2,241,000 of net proceeds to redeem preferred stock, including
interest and dividends, and $4,019,000 including interest to repay subordinated
debt.
In November 1995, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and the Board of
Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right
for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the
close of business on November 29, 1995. Initially, these rights will not be
exercisable and will trade with the shares of the Company common stock. Under
the Shareholder Rights Plan, the rights become exercisable if a person becomes
an acquiring person by acquiring 15% or more of the common stock of Expert
Software, if a person who owns 10% or more of the common stock of the Company is
determined to be an adverse person by the Board of Directors, or if a person
commences a tender offer that would result in that person owning 15% or more of
the common stock of the Company. In the event that a person becomes an
acquiring person or is declared an adverse person by the Board, each holder
of a right other than the acquiring person or the adverse person would be
entitled to acquire such number of shares of preferred stock which are
equivalent to Expert Software common stock having a value of twice the
then-current exercise price of the right. If the Company is acquired in a merger
or other business combination transaction after any such event, each holder of a
right would then be entitled to purchase, at the then current purchase price,
shares of the acquiring company common stock having a value of twice the
exercise price of the right. The rights will expire at the close of business on
November 9, 2005, unless previously redeemed or exchanged by the Company. In
connection with the Shareholder Rights Plan, the Board of Directors authorized
the designation of 25,000 shares of Series A Junior Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, $001 par value, none of which are outstanding at December 31,
1997 or 1996.
In March 1997, pursuant to its obligations under the Swfte acquisition
agreement, the Company completed a registration with the Securities and Exchange
Commission of substantially all the shares of Company common stock issued in
connection with the Swfte acquisition.
8. STOCK OPTIONS The Company has reserved 2,250,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under
its 1992 Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan, 1,000,000 shares under its 1997
Stock Option Plan for Officers and Employees the 1997 Plan, and 250,000
shares under the 1997 Stock Option Plan for Directors the Directors' Plan,
the 1992 Plan, the 1997 Plan and the Directors' Plan are referred to herein
collectively as the Plans.Under the Plans, options may be granted to purchase
common stock at exercise prices generally determined by a committee of the Board
of Directors. Incentive stock options may be granted at exercise prices not less
than the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant, and in
certain instances, at prices in excess of the current fair market value.
Non-employee members of the Board of Directors are granted non-qualified options
annually at a price equal to the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of the grant. Incentive stock options are available to officers, directors
who are also employees and other full-time employees and non-qualified options
are available to the same group and consultants and other key persons who
provide services to the Company. The terms and vesting schedule of each option
agreement are determined by the Board of Directors; vesting typically is ratably
over four years. All options expire on the date specified in the agreement and
in no event later than the tenth anniversary of the date which the option was
granted. A summary of stock option activity is as follows                                Weighted

At December 31, 1997, options to purchase 1,716,965 shares of common stock were
available for grant under the Plans. Canceled options increase the amount
of options available to be granted under the Plans.
The Company applied APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock option plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost for stock options
granted to employees has been recognized under the Plans. Had compensation been
recorded based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under the Plans
consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the Company proforma net income loss
and diluted income loss per share would have been as follows in thousands,

Diluted earnings per share, as reported  $ 21 $137 $ 33
Diluted earnings per share, proforma    $ 15 $140 $ 34 The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Sholes  option pricing model with the following  weighted  average
assumptions: expected volatility ranging from 40% to 70%, risk-free interest
rate of 5%, expected dividends of $0 and expected lives of five years. In 1997
and 1996, the Company recorded compensation expense of $54,000 and $7,000,
respectively,  related to options to purchase  common stock  granted to
non-employees of the Company accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 123.

profitability which can be predicted with reasonable certainty.
10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share were computed by dividing income available to
common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share were determined by
including assumptions of stock option conversions, except for periods in which
the Company reported a loss from continuing operations. Effective December 31,
1997, the Company adopted SFAS 128. As a result, the earnings loss per share
of common stock for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 have been
restated in accordance with the requirements of SFAS 128. In thousands, except per share amounts   Income      Per-Share

Options to purchase approximately 172,300 shares of common stock at prices from
$5375 to $6625 were outstanding during 1997 but were not included in the
computation of diluted EPS because the options' prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares. The options, which expire between
January 1999 and December 2001, were still outstanding at December 31, 1997.
11. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In October 1996, the Company settled litigation with David H. Goodman, the
former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Swfte International, Ltd., and
others. The original dispute involved the contingent purchase price to the
Agreement and Plan of Merger among Expert, ES I Acquisition Corp., Swfte and the
Stockholders of Swfte, dated as of October 16, 1995. The results for the third
quarter of 1996 include expenses of $1,900,000 for the settlement, as well as
related legal and associated costs. A portion of the settlement will be paid in
agreed-upon installments through April 1, 1998.
12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases office space under operating leases. Rent expense under
operating leases was $510,000, $661,000, and $368,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company leases certain
equipment under capital leases, which are recorded at the present value of
future  minimum lease  payments.  Future  minimum lease  payments  under
non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases at December 31, 1997 are as

with developers and licensers. Minimum royalty guarantees under such contracts
are approximately $125,000, $150,000, $175,000 and $200,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
The Company federal tax filings with respect to the year ended December 31,
1992 and subsequent years are presently being reviewed by the Internal Revenue
Service IRS. The IRS has questioned the allocation of the purchase price
made by the Company in connection with the acquisition of assets and business of
the Predecessor from Bloc in October 1992, and related amortization and other
deductions with respect to the acquired assets. In June 1997, the IRS proposed
assessments for additional taxes of $412,000, $553,000 and $857,000 for the tax
years 1992, 1993 and 1994, respectively, plus interest to the date of payment.
The preliminary adjustments proposed by the IRS would also reduce the Company
federal income taxes for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997 by $242,000, $68,000 and
$55,000, respectively. The Company believes that it has properly reported its
income and paid its taxes in accordance with applicable laws and intends to
contest the proposed adjustments vigorously. The Company believes that the
ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on
its financial position. Item 1.

meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of stockholders
and until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier
resignation or removal.   Compliance with Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires the Company
officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of the Company
outstanding shares of Common Stock, to file reports of ownership and changes in
ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq. Officers,
directors and greater than ten percent stockholders are required by SEC
regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16a forms they
file.
Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or
written representations from certain reporting persons that no Section 16a
reports were required for those persons, the Company believes that during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1997, all filing requirements were complied with,
except in the case of Susan A. Currier who failed to timely file one report
regarding a scheduled sale of the Common Stock.
