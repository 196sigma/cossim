To the Stockholders of Edgewater Technology, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Edgewater
Technology, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years
ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Edgewater Technology, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years ended December 31,
2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS:
Edgewater Technology, Inc. Edgewater or the Company f/k/a StaffMark,
Inc. provides human resource and business solutions through its eSolutions
segment, Edgewater Technology Delaware, Inc. Edgewater Technology, which
was acquired effective April 1, 1999. As discussed in Note 4, the Company sold
its interests in their Commercial staffing segment, Robert Walters finance and
accounting staffing services, Strategic Legal Resources legal staffing,
IntelliMark information technology staffing and solutions and ClinForce
clinical trials support services. Robert Walters, Strategic Legal Resources,
IntelliMark and ClinForce were previously components of the Company
Professional/Information Technology IT segment. As a result of these
transactions, the operating results for these non-eSolutions divisions have been
included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
Edgewater provides IT consulting services to businesses. These services
primarily include the design, development and implementation of web-based
applications as well as eCommerce software solutions and consulting services to
clients throughout the United States. Edgewater Technology has approximately 250
employees and offices in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Arkansas, Minnesota,
North Carolina and Alabama.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Principles of Consolidation   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Edgewater and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents   The Company considers cash on deposit with financial institutions and all
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment   Property and equipment are stated at cost, which approximates fair value,
net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from three to ten years. Equipment held under capital leases
are amortized utilizing the straight-line method over the lessor of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the lease. Additions
that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized while repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. When property and equipment are
retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are
removed from the balance sheet and any resultant gain or loss is recorded.
Intangible Assets   Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which is amortized over 10
years using the straight-line method. Intangibles associated with non-compete
agreements are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of the
respective agreements.
In conjunction with management restructuring plan described more fully in
Note 4, in January 2000, management decided to operate its eSolutions business
unit as a distinct operating unit as opposed to an integrated component of the
Professional/IT segment, as had been originally planned. As a result of this
change in operating strategy, management reevaluated the estimated useful life
for the intangibles associated with their acquisition of Edgewater Technology
and reduced the estimated useful life to 10 years. Prior to the restructure and
segmentation, these intangibles were amortized over 30 years since Edgewater
Technology was operated as an integral component of the Professional/IT segment.
The change in useful life was made effective January 1, 2000 and resulted in
increased annual amortization expense of approximately $24 million. In
addition, as a result of an independent appraisal obtained during the fall of
2000, the Company reallocated the Edgewater Technology purchase price between
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets see Note 8.
38 Revenue Recognition   Revenues pursuant to time and materials contracts are generally recognized
as services are provided. Revenues pursuant to fixed price contracts are
generally recognized as services are rendered using the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting. Revenues and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to
quarter based on the number, size and scope of projects in which we are engaged,
the contractual terms and degree of completion of such projects, any delays
incurred in connection with a project, employee utilization rates, the adequacy
of provisions for losses, the use of estimates of resources required to complete
ongoing projects, general economic conditions and other factors. Certain
significant estimates include percentage-of-completion estimates used for fixed
price contracts and the allowance for doubtful accounts. These items are
frequently monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and
circumstances and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.
Income Taxes   Income taxes have been provided based upon the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred income taxes using the liability method.
Deferred income taxes result from the effect of transactions which are
recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes.
Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of such temporary
differences by applying currently enacted statutory tax rates to differences
between the financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and
liabilities. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts ultimately expected to be realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments   Edgewater financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and its
debt obligations. Management believes that these financial instruments bear
interest at rates which approximate prevailing market rates for instruments with
similar characteristics and, accordingly, that the carrying values for these
instruments are reasonable estimates of fair value.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   Edgewater regularly evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred
which may indicate that the carrying amount of intangible or other long-lived
assets warrant revision or may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that an
asset or assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, an evaluation is
performed pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. If
an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows
associated with the asset are compared to the asset carrying amount to
determine if a write-down to market value or discounted cash flow value is
required. During 2000, the Company recognized an impairment in the goodwill
associated with its Professional/IT segment as more fully described in Note 4.
Stock Options   During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, which encourages all companies to
recognize compensation expense based on the fair value, at grant date, of
instruments issued pursuant to stock-based compensation plans. SFAS No. 123
requires the fair value of the instruments granted, which is measured pursuant
to the provisions of the statement, to be recognized as compensation expense
over the vesting period of the instrument. However, the statement also allows
companies to continue to measure compensation costs for these instruments using
the method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Companies electing
to account for stock-based compensation plans pursuant to the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income as if the fair
value method defined in SFAS No. 123 had been applied. Edgewater has elected to
account for stock options under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and has
included the disclosures required by SFAS No. 123 in Note 13.
Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates
and assumptions used in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial
statements are based upon management evaluation of the relevant facts and
circumstances as of the date of the financial statements. However, actual
results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these
consolidated financial statements.
39 Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition. This bulletin,
as amended, established guidelines for revenue recognition and originally was
effective for periods beginning after March 15, 2000. In June 2000, the SEC
announced that the effective date of SAB 101 was being delayed until no later
than the quarter ending December 31, 2000. The Company revenue recognition
policy complies with the pronouncement and, accordingly, there was no impact of
adopting this new guidance in 2000.
In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock
Compensation - An Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25, FIN 44. FIN 44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion 25 and, among other issues, clarifies
the following: a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB
Opinion 25, b the criteria for determining whether a stock ownership plan
qualifies as noncompensatory, c the accounting implications of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and d
the accounting for the exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000 and the effects of applying FIN 44
are recognized on a prospective basis. The adoption of this interpretation did
not have a material impact on the Company financial condition or results of
operations.
3.   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS:
Effective April 1, 1999, the Company acquired Edgewater Technology, a
full-service provider of eSolutions located in Boston Route 128 technology
corridor. Edgewater Technology applies its eStrategy, eSolutions and Internet
outsourcing services to vertical markets such as financial services, customer
service centers, transportation and logistics, retail/e-tail and healthcare.
Edgewater Technology brings mission-critical eSolutions to clients primarily in
the middle market. As the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business
combination, the consolidated financial statements include the operating results
of Edgewater Technology from the date of acquisition. The cost of this
acquisition has been allocated based on estimated fair market value of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the excess costs over fair values
of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to goodwill are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.
The aggregate consideration paid with respect to acquisitions was $07
million and $427 million for 2000 and 1999, respectively. The remaining earnout
for the acquisition of Edgewater Technology was determined as $12 million and
was paid in the first quarter of 2001. As this amount was fixed and
determinable, it has been accrued and recorded as goodwill in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.
The unaudited consolidated results of operations for 1999 on a pro forma
basis as though Edgewater Technology had been acquired as of the beginning of
1999 are presented below.                                In Thousands, Except Per Share Data

40 4.   DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:
On June 28, 2000, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated May 16, 2000 with
Stephens Group, Inc., the Company sold all of its subsidiaries, and the assets
and liabilities of its Commercial staffing segment to affiliate entities of
Stephens Group, Inc. As consideration, the Company received gross proceeds of
$1901 million in cash before fees, expenses and taxes. As part of the
transaction, the Company sold the name StaffMark as that was the name used by
the Commercial staffing segment.
On July 13, 2000, the Company sold, through two indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries, all of its equity interests in Robert Walters through an initial
public offering on the London Stock Exchange. Robert Walters had previously been
the Company finance and accounting platform within its Professional/IT
segment. The Company two subsidiaries sold 67,200,000 ordinary shares at a
price of 170 pence per share or $257 at then current exchange rates. The
shares began trading on a conditional basis on the London Stock Exchange on July
6, 2000. On July 14, 2000, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment of
10,400,000 ordinary shares. The Company share of offering gross proceeds,
including the exercise of the over-allotment option, was $1992 million prior to
offering commissions, fees and expenses.
During the second quarter of 2000, in accordance with SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be Disposed Of, the Company recorded a $150 million non-cash charge for the
write-down of the goodwill in its IntelliMark and Strategic Legal Resources
divisions to estimated realizable values. This write-down was largely due to a
decline in the revenues, gross profit and cash flow of these divisions and the
overall decrease in market values within these industries. Accordingly, the
carrying values of these assets were written down to management estimates of
fair value, which were based on market comparables for companies operating in
similar industries.
On September 22, 2000, the Company sold all of the outstanding stock of
Strategic Legal Resources, the legal staffing platform within its
Professional/IT segment, to a company owned by a group of investors including
MidMark Capital II, L.P. and Edwardstone & Company for $1325 million, of which
$425 million was represented by a promissory note. The balance of this note was
collected in January 2001.
On November 16, 2000, the Company sold all of the outstanding shares of
stock of its subsidiaries that comprised IntelliMark, its IT staffing and
solutions division, to IM Acquisition, Inc., an affiliate of Charlesbank Equity
Fund V Limited Partnership, for approximately $427 million in cash, subject to
potential upward or downward post-closing adjustments. In connection with this
sale, the Company recorded a $539 million non-cash charge for the write-down of
the goodwill in its IntelliMark division to estimated realizable values. The
effect of this adjustment is included in net gain on sale of divisions in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
On December 15, 2000, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to
sell all of its outstanding stock in ClinForce to Cross Country TravCorps, Inc.
for approximately $31 million in cash, before fees and expenses and subject to
potential upward or downward post-closing adjustment the Transaction. The
Company held a Special Stockholders' Meeting on March 14, 2001 to approve the
Transaction. After receiving approval from stockholders, the Transaction was
closed on March 16, 2001. As a result of receiving this approval, the financial
results for ClinForce are included in discontinued operations in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company estimates that it
will record a gain of approximately $144 million before taxes related to the
Transaction during the first quarter of 2001.
During the third and fourth quarter of 2000, as a result of the impending
sale of the Company remaining two segments, the Company recorded nonrecurring
expenses totaling approximately $38 million relating to the Company
divestiture process and costs related to the closing of the Company former
corporate headquarters in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The move of the corporate
headquarters to Wakefield, Massachusetts, where the eSolutions segement is
located, is expected to be completed during the second quarter of 2001. All of
the remaining corporate employees approximately 25 have been or will be
severed as a result of this restructuring. The restructuring expense includes
future contractual obligations to certain employees, which extend through
October 2001. As a result of the above, expenses of approximately $30 million
for severance costs, $06 million for facility costs and $02 million for
relocation costs were recorded in the third and fourth quarter of 2000 and have
been included in discontinued operations.
41   The following is a summary of the Company restructuring accrual, which has
been included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets                            In Thousands

Amortization expense related to intangible assets for the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 1999 totaled approximately $45 million and $05 million,
respectively.
9.   DEBT:
The Company had a credit facility the Credit Facility with a consortium
of banks which was used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 1999, maximum borrowings
pursuant to the Credit Facility were limited to approximately $3250 million.
Additionally, during December 1999, the Company obtained a commitment from two
members of its Credit Facility to increase its borrowing capacity for an
additional $100 million through January 2000. This increased borrowing capacity
was not utilized by the Company. On March 31, 2000, the maximum amount of
borrowings under the Credit Facility reverted back to $300 million. In April
2000, the Company obtained a commitment from one member of the Credit Facility
to increase its borrowing capacity for an additional $75 million through May
2000 as a buffer for unexpected costs. This $75 million borrowing increase was
never utilized by the Company. The $300 million portion of the Credit Facility
was scheduled to mature in August 2003.
In July 2000, using proceeds from the sale of its Commercial staffing
segment and Robert Walters, the Company paid-off all of its outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Facility and terminated the Credit Facility.
43   Interest on borrowings was computed at the Company option, either the
bank group prime rate or the London interbank offered rate, incrementally
adjusted based on the Company operating leverage ratios. This rate averaged
754% for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and 653% for the year ended
December 31, 1999. As of December 31, 1999, the Company was required to pay a
quarterly facility fee determined by multiplying the total amount of the Credit
Facility by a percentage which varied based on the Company operating leverage
ratios. As of December 31, 1999, this fee was 025% of the total amount of the
Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility required compliance with certain financial ratios and
other operational covenants. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at
December 31, 1999. The Credit Facility was secured by all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company first tier foreign
subsidiaries.
10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:
In 1998, the Company entered into fixed interest rate swap agreements with
a notional amount of $600 million related to borrowings under the Credit
Facility to hedge against increases in interest rates which would increase the
cost of variable rate borrowings under the Credit Facility. In May 2000, the
Company terminated the agreements and recognized the proceeds as an asset to be
amortized over the original life of the contracts. These swaps did not have a
material impact on recorded interest expense during the periods presented. In
July 2000, in conjunction with the repayment and termination of the Credit
Facility, the Company wrote off the unamortized balance and recognized a gain of
approximately $10 million on these swaps in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.
The Company involvement with derivative financial instruments was limited
to the interest rate swap agreements discussed above. The Company entered into
these agreements as hedges against increases in interest rates which would
increase the cost of its variable rate borrowings under our Credit Facility.
Conversely, the Company was exposed to the risk that the cost of those
borrowings would be higher than the amount computed under our Credit Facility
should interest rates decline. In addition, the Company was exposed to credit
risk in the event of non-performance by the bank facilitating these agreements
but had no off-balance-sheet risk of accounting loss related to these
agreements. At December 31, 2000, the Company had no open foreign currency
derivatives.

The Company has net operating losses for federal income tax purposes of
approximately $177 million, which expire through 2020. The utilization of these
losses in any given year may be limited in the event that a significant
ownership change, as defined, has occurred. A valuation allowance for the
deferred tax assets has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as management believes that some deferred tax assets are more likely than
not to be remain unrecoverable. In assessing the realizability of deferred
income tax assets, management has considered scheduled reversals of the deferred
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the amount and
expiration of net operating loss carryforwards.
The differences in income taxes determined by applying the statutory
federal tax rate of 34% for 2000, 1999 and 1998, to income from continuing

The Company maintains several defined contribution employee benefit plans,
some of which allow eligible employees to defer a portion of their income
through contributions to the plans. Contributions by Edgewater to the various
plans were approximately $18 million, $16 million and $12 million for the
years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
In May 1997 and May 2000, the Company stockholders approved an employee
stock purchase plan the Stock Purchase Plan which grants employees the right
to purchase shares of the Company common stock at a price equal to the lower
of 85% of the market value on the date of purchase or the beginning of the
calendar quarter of the purchase. Purchases under the Stock Purchase Plan are
limited to 10% of the respective employees' compensation and do not impact the
Company reported net loss.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK OPTIONS:
Common Stock    The Company stockholders had authorized 200 million shares of common
stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock for issuance as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively. In January 2001, the Company completed an issuer
tender offer in which the Company repurchased 1625 million shares of its common
stock at $800 per share for aggregate consideration of $130 million, and common
stock subject to certain vested in-the-money stock options. This repurchase of
options will result in a $02 million compensation charge in January 2001.
Dividends    Edgewater has not historically paid any dividends on its common stock and
intends to continue this practice for the foreseeable future with regard to cash
generated through its normal operations. The Company 1998 dividend in the
accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity was paid by Robert
Walters prior to their pooling-of-interests transaction with the Company.
Stock Options    In October 1999, Edgewater Board of Directors amended Edgewater 1996
Stock Option Plan the Plan to increase the maximum number of shares of
Edgewater common stock that may be issued under the Plan from 12% to 15% of
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. Options granted under
the Plan generally become 33% vested after one year and then vest 33% in each of
the next two years or become 40% vested after two years and then vest 20% in
each of the next three years. Under the Plan, the exercise price of the option
equals the market value of Edgewater common stock on the date of the grant,
and the maximum term for each option is 10 years.
Robert Walters maintained three stock option plans for its employees, all
of which required compensatory accounting treatment under APB Opinion No. 25.
Total compensation income recognized related to Robert Walters stock option
plans was $07 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This amount is
included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements
of operations and reflected as an adjustment to paid-in capital in the
accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
In February 2000, the Company adopted a subsidiary stock option plan the
Subsidiary Plan for employees and consultants of Edgewater Technology, its
eSolutions segment. The purpose of the Subsidiary Plan was to aid Edgewater
Technology in attracting and retaining employees and consultants. The total
amount of Edgewater common stock for which stock options could be granted under
the Subsidiary Plan could not exceed 50 million shares of Edgewater common
stock. In August 2000, the Subsidiary Plan was terminated and the options for
29 million shares of the Company subsidiary stock that had been granted under
this Subsidiary Plan were exchanged into 18 million options under a newly
created parent company stock option plan the Parent Plan and into 11
million options under the Company Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan.
The Parent Plan excludes grants for directors and officers and for which stock
option grants may not exceed 40 million shares of the Company common stock.
As a result of this exchange, the Company recorded a one-time compensation
charge of $02 million.

Options outstanding under the Amended and Restated 1996 Edgewater Stock
Option Plan vested 100% upon the closing of the Transaction as this constituted
a change in control as defined in the plan, except for 11 million stock
options granted under this plan to officers of the Company eSolutions business
in August 2000. Employees of the Commercial segment and IntelliMark hold
approximately 14 million of these outstanding options, which terminate on April
16, 2001, which is 30 days following the change in control. Employees of
ClinForce hold approximately 01 million of these outstanding options, which
terminate on June 14, 2001, which is 90 days following the change in control.
As discussed in Note 2, Edgewater has elected to account for its stock
options under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations other than the compensation expense recognized related to the
Subsidiary Plan stock option plans as discussed above. Pursuant to the
requirements of SFAS No. 123, the following disclosures are presented to reflect
Edgewater pro forma net loss income for the years ended December 31, 2000,
1999 and 1998, as if the fair value method of accounting prescribed by SFAS No.
123 had been used. In preparing the pro forma disclosures, the fair value was
estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. These
fair value calculations were based on the following assumptions                              Years Ended December 31,
2000     1999    1998
Weighted average risk-free interest rate      481%    634%    455%

Expected volatility                  78%     80%     58                    47   Using these assumptions, the fair value of the noncompensatory stock options
granted during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
approximately $140 million, $87 million and $120 million, respectively. The
weighted average fair value per share of noncompensatory options granted during
2000, 1999 and 1998 was $410, $564 and $1460, respectively. Had compensation
expense been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, utilizing the assumptions
above and the straight-line amortization method over the vesting period, net
loss income would have been adjusted to the following pro forma amounts                                        Years Ended December 31,

Options to purchase 24 million shares of common stock at prices ranging
from $672 to $4031 per share were outstanding during 2000 but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options'
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the Company
common shares. These options, which expire ten years from the date of issue,
were still outstanding as of December 31, 2000. Options to purchase
approximately 21 million shares of common stock at prices ranging from $1138
to $4075 per share were outstanding during 1999 but were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise prices
were greater than the average market price of the Company common shares.
15.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
Edgewater has entered into agreements with certain stockholders and officers
of the Company to lease certain parcels of land and buildings used in the
Company operations. Rent expense related to these facilities totaled
approximately $04 million, $05 million and $06 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Future related party lease
obligations relate to the Company current corporate headquarters in
Fayetteville, Arkansas. As the Company corporate headquarters will be moving
to Wakefield, Massachusetts during 2001, the Company is currently in the process
of negotiating a sublease or assignment of the Fayetteville lease to a third
party.
48   Annual future minimum payments required under this lease are included in the
table in Note 17 and are summarized as follows         Fiscal Years                Amount

respectively.
Synapse Group, Inc., one of our significant customers discussed in Note 19,
is considered a related party as their President and Chief Executive Officer
Michael Loeb is also a member of the Company Board of Directors. As of
December 31, 2000, the Company maintained an accounts receivable balance of $22
million from Synapse Group, Inc.
16.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
The Company has been subject to a number of stockholder lawsuits alleging
that the Company and one of its officer/directors violated federal securities
laws. Such actions were consolidated into one action in United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas the Court. In June 2000, the
Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order dismissing most of the allegations
in the consolidated complaint. In November 2000, the Court granted the Company
motion for partial reconsideration and dismissed all of the remaining
allegations in the complaint. The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration
in December 2000 and, in January 2001, the Court rejected the plaintiffs'
request for reconsideration resulting in the entire consolidated complaint being
dismissed by the Court. In February 2001, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal
of the complaint to the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, Missouri.
Although the outcome is uncertain, the Company believes that this complaint is
without merit and denies all of the allegations of wrongdoing and is vigorously
defending the suit. Accordingly, no provisions have been made in the
accompanying financial statements related to this matter.
Edgewater is subject to certain claims and lawsuits arising in the normal
course of business. Edgewater maintains various insurance coverages in order to
minimize the financial risk associated with certain of these claims.
Edgewater has employment agreements with certain executive officers and
management personnel that provide for annual salaries, cost-of-living
adjustments and additional compensation in the form of performance-based
bonuses. Certain agreements include covenants against competition with
Edgewater, which extend for a period of time after termination. These agreements
generally continue until terminated by the employee or Edgewater.
17.   NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES:
Edgewater leases office space and certain equipment under noncancelable
operating leases through 2009. As discussed in Note 15, certain of these
facilities are leased from related parties. Annual future minimum payments
required under operating leases that have an initial or remaining noncancelable
lease term in excess of one year are as follows         Fiscal Years                Amount

18.   SEGMENT INFORMATION:
As a result of the Company IT restructuring plan in late 1999, as
discussed in Note 4, the Company determined that Edgewater Technology, its
eSolutions business, was fundamentally different than the other components of
its Professional/IT segment and the Company began managing the eSolutions
segment as an autonomous business unit beginning in 2000. Accordingly, in
January 2000, Edgewater began disaggregating the results of its eSolutions
business unit and reviewing those results separately. These operations had
previously been included in its Professional/IT segment.
The Company eSolutions segment, provides eCommerce software solutions,
consulting and development services. The corporate column below includes
general corporate expenses, headquarters facilities and equipment, internal-use
software, and other expenses not allocated to the segments. The corporate
column includes general corporate expenses, headquarters facilities and
equipment, internal-use software, and other expenses not allocated to the
segment.
The accounting policies used in measuring segment assets and operating
results are the same as those described in Note 2. The Company evaluates
performance of the segments based on segment operating income, excluding
corporate overhead. The Company does not have any significant intersegment sales
or transfers. Revenues and property and equipment for all periods presented are
from operations in the United States.
The results of the Company business segments as of and for the years
ending December 31 are as follows                                Edgewater            Consolidated
