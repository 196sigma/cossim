REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board
of Directors and Stockholders of Hub Group, Inc.:
We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hub Group, Inc. as of
December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2008.Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the index at b.These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company
management.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States.Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement.An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement
presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hub Group, Inc. at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.
As
described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January
1, 2007, the Company changed its method of accounting for uncertain tax
positions to conform with FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes.
We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, Hub Group, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16, 2009

HUB
GROUP, INC.
NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE
1.Description
of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business:Hub
Group, Inc. we, us or our provides intermodal transportation services
utilizing primarily third party arrangements with railroads and drayage
companies.We also arrange for transportation of freight by truck and
perform logistics and drayage services.
Principles of
Consolidation:The consolidated financial statements include
our accounts and all entities in which we have more than a 50% equity ownership
or otherwise exercise unilateral control.All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents:We consider as cash equivalents all highly liquid
instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.In
2008, we invested our cash overnight in a money market fund comprised of U.S.
Treasury Securities and repurchase agreements for these securities, of which
$840 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008.In 2007, we
invested our cash overnight in commercial paper, of which $330 million was
outstanding at December 31, 2007.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance
for Uncollectible Accounts: In the normal course of business,
we extend credit to customers after a review of each customers credit
history.An allowance for uncollectible trade accounts has been
established through an analysis of the accounts receivable aging, an assessment
of collectibility based on historical trends and an evaluation based on current
economic conditions.To be more specific, we reserve a portion of
every account balance that has aged over one year, a portion of receivables for
customers in bankruptcy and certain account balances specifically identified as
uncollectible.On an annual basis we perform a hindsight analysis to
determine our experience in collecting account balances over one year old and
account balances in bankruptcy.We then use this hindsight
analysis to establish our reserves for receivables over one year and in
bankruptcy. In establishing a reserve for certain account balances specifically
identified as uncollectible, we consider the aging of the customer receivables,
the customers current and projected financial results, the customers ability
to meet and sustain their financial commitments, the positive or negative
effects of the current and projected industry outlook and the general economic
conditions.The allowance for uncollectible accounts is reported on
the balance sheet in net accounts receivable.Our reserve for
uncollectible accounts was approximately $51 million and $55 million at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.Recoveries of receivables
previously charged off are recorded when received.
Property and
Equipment:Property and equipment are stated at
cost.Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the
straight-line and various accelerated methods at rates adequate to depreciate
the cost of the applicable assets over their expected useful
lives:building and improvements, 1 to 8 years; leasehold
improvements, the shorter of useful life or lease term; computer equipment and
software, 3 to 5 years; furniture and equipment, 3 to 11 years; and
transportation equipment and automobiles, 5 to 10 years.Direct costs
related to internally developed software projects are capitalized and amortized
over their expected useful life on a straight-line basis not to exceed five
years.Interest is capitalized on qualifying assets under development
for internal use.Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations
as incurred and major improvements are capitalized.The cost of
assets retired or otherwise disposed of and the accumulated depreciation thereon
are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss realized upon sale or
disposal charged or credited to operations.We review long-lived
assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.In the event that
the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset group is
less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the
assets carrying amount over its fair value is recorded.
Goodwill and Other
Intangibles:Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
over the fair market value of net assets acquired in connection with our
business combinations.Under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Statement 142,
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not
amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests.
We review
goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment as of November 1
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles may not be
recoverable.An indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if its
fair value is less than its carrying value.Goodwill impairment is
indicated if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying
value.We utilize a third party independent valuation firm to assist
in performing the necessary valuations to be used in the impairment
testing.These valuations are based on a market comparable approach,
a discounted cash flow approach or a combination of both
approaches.The assumptions used in the valuations include
expectations regarding future operating performance which are consistent with
out internal projections and operating plans, discount rates, control premiums
and other factors which are subjective in nature.As of December 31,
2008, reasonable variations in these assumptions do not have a significant
impact on the results of the goodwill impairment test.Actual cash
flows from operations could differ from managements estimates due to changes in
business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.
31
In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets SFAS No. 144, we evaluate
the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets when
impairment indicators exist.If the carrying value is no longer
recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the
amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the
fair value of the asset.
Fair Value of Financial
Instruments:The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value as of December
31, 2008 due to their short-term nature.
Concentration of Credit
Risk:Our financial instruments that are exposed to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
accounts receivable.We place our cash and temporary investments with
high quality financial institutions and invest our cash overnight in a money
market fund comprised of U.S. Treasury Securities and repurchase agreements for
these securities.We primarily serve customers located throughout the
United States with no significant concentration in any one region.No
one customer accounted for more than 5% of revenue in 2008, 2007 or
2006.We review a customers credit history before extending
credit.In addition, we routinely assess the financial strength of
our customers and, as a consequence, believe that our trade accounts receivable
risk is limited.
Revenue
Recognition:Revenue is recognized at the time 1 persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, 2 services have been rendered, 3 the sales
price is fixed and determinable and 4 collectibility is reasonably
assured.In accordance with EITF 91-9, revenue and related
transportation costs are recognized based on relative transit
time.Further, we report our revenue on a gross basis in accordance
with the criteria in EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent.We are the primary obligor as we are responsible
for providing the service desired by the customer.Our customers view
us as responsible for fulfillment including the acceptability of the
service.Services requirements may include, for example, on-time
delivery, handling freight loss and damage claims, setting up appointments for
pick up and delivery and tracing shipments in transit.We have
discretion in setting sales prices and as a result, the amount we earn
varies.In addition, we have the discretion to select our vendors
from multiple suppliers for the services ordered by our
customers.Finally, we have credit risk for our
receivables.These three factors, discretion in setting prices,
discretion in selecting vendors and credit risk, further support reporting
revenue on a gross basis.
Deferred Income
Taxes:Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax
effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting
using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to
reverse.We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred
tax assets will be realized with the exception of $02 million related to state
tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance has been
established.In the event the probability of realizing the deferred
tax assets do not meet the more likely than not threshold in the future, a
valuation allowance would be established for the deferred tax assets deemed
unrecoverable.
Accounting for Income Taxes:
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
which is an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes.We adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007.FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the
financial statements.FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure and transition.In addition, FIN 48 clearly
scopes out income taxes from Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
5, Accounting for Contingencies.
New
Pronouncements:In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS
No. 157. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB deferred
the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for all nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, except for those items that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at
least annually.In addition, certain leasing transactions accounted
for under SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, are now excluded from the scope
of SFAS No. 157.We adopted SFAS No. 157 effective January 1,
2008.There was no cumulative effect recorded upon adoption as of
January 1, 2008 or significant impact on our financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2008. See Note 4 for additional information.
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS No. 159.SFAS No. 159
permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value.SFAS No159was
effective January1, 2008, but we have decided not to adopt this optional
standard at this time.
The FASB
issued Statement of SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations SFAS No. 141R
in December 2007.SFAS No. 141R requires the acquiring entity in a
business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
their respective acquisition-date fair values including contingent
consideration.In addition SFAS No. 141R changes the recognition of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from preacquisition
contingencies and requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as
incurred.SFAS No. 141R applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1,
2009.We adopted SFAS No. 141R effective January 1, 2009 and do not
currently expect the impact on our financial statements to be
significant.
32
The FASB
issued Statement of SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest SFAS No. 160 in
December 2007.SFAS No. 160 clarifies the classification of
noncontrolling interests in consolidated statements of financial position and
the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity
and holders of such noncontrolling interests.SFAS No. 160 is
effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins on or
after December 15, 2008 and is required to be adopted prospectively, except for
the reclassification of noncontrolling interests to equity and the recasting of
net income loss attributable to both the controlling and noncontrolling
interests, which are required to be adopted retrospectively.We
adopted SFAS No. 160 effective January 1, 2009 and do not currently expect the
impact on our financial statements to be significant.
In April
2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP No. 142-3, Determination of the
Useful Life of Intangible Assets.This FSP amends the factors that
should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.This statement is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.We adopted FSP No.
142-3 effective January 1, 2009 and do not currently expect the impact on our
financial statements to be significant.
Earnings Per Common
Share:Basic earnings per common share are based on the
average quarterly weighted average number of Class A and Class B shares of
common stock outstanding.Diluted earnings per common share are
adjusted for the assumed exercise of dilutive stock options and for restricted
stock.In computing the per share effect ofthe assumed
exercise of stock options, funds which would have been received from the
exercise of options, including tax benefits assumed to be realized, are
considered to have been used to purchase shares at current market prices, and
the resulting net additional shares are included in the calculation of weighted
average shares outstanding.The dilutive effect of restricted stock
and stock options is computed using the treasury method.
Stock based
Compensation:Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair
value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123 R Share-Based Payment
SFAS No. 123 R, using the modified-prospective transition
method.Under that transition method, compensation cost recognized in
2006 includes: a compensation costs for all share-based payments granted prior
to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123 and b
compensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123 R.We have not granted any stock options since
2003.
We have
elected to calculate our initial pool of excess benefits under FASB Staff
Position 123 R-3 FSP. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123 R, we
presented all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of
share-based compensation as operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash
Flows.Beginning on January 1, 2006, we changed our cash flow
presentation in accordance with the FSP which requires benefits of tax
deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits
to be classified as a financing cash in-flow and an operating cash
out-flow.The results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006 include $29 million, $40 million and $123 million of excess tax
benefits, respectively, as a financing cash in-flow and an operating cash
out-flow.
Use of
Estimates:The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during
the reporting period.Significant estimates include the allowance for
doubtful accounts and the cost of purchased transportation.Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications: Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
NOTE

During
2007, the State of Illinois enacted tax legislation which impacts us by
modifying how we apportion taxable income to Illinois.The new
legislation resulted in a reduction of our net deferred liabilities and a credit
to our provision for state income taxes of approximately $12 million in the
third quarter.This resulted in a reduction in our effective tax rate
of 13% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Our state
net operating losses of $04 million expire between December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2023.Management believes it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax assets will be realized with the exception of $02 million
related to state net operating losses for which a valuation allowance has been
established.
Effective
January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No. 48 FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes.Although the implementation of FIN 48 did not impact the
amount of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, we reclassified our
liability for unrecognized tax benefits from deferred tax liabilities to
non-current liabilities to conform with the balance sheet presentation
requirements of FIN 48.As of January 1, 2007, the amount of
unrecognized tax benefits, including $21 million $13 million net of income
tax of accrued interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits, was $53
million.
During
its examination of our 1997 federal income tax return, the Internal Revenue
Service IRS proposed to reclassify our allocation of a significant amount of
tax basis in fixed assets to non-amortizable intangibles.The dispute
was ultimately resolved in the fourth quarter of 2007 after the IRS Office of
Appeals reviewed the dispute and permitted the statute of limitations to
lapse.The settlement reduced our 2007 income tax provision by $13
million and resulted in a reclassification of our liability for unrecognized tax
benefits to a deferred tax liability.
As of
December 31, 2008, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $04 million, of
which $02 million would decrease our income tax provision, if
recognized.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
unrecognized tax benefits excluding accrued interest expense is as follows in
millions:

During
the fourth quarter of 2007, $15 million of accrued interest, net of income tax,
was reversed as a consequence of the settlement of our dispute with the
IRS.This resulted in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 14%
for the year ended December 31, 2007.
36
We are
subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and numerous state
jurisdictions.The IRS has completed examinations of our federal
income tax returns through 2004.The IRS commenced an examination of
our 2006 tax year in October 2008.Illinois is currently examining
our 2005 and 2006 tax years.Although no other examinations are in
effect currently, tax years 2005 through 2007 generally remain open to
examination by the major tax jurisdictions to which we are subject.
We
recognize interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
our provision for income taxes.During 2008 we paid penalties of
approximately two thousand dollars and received interest related to income tax
refunds of approximately eighteen thousand dollars.
NOTE
7.Long-Term
Debt and Financing Arrangements
We have a
revolving credit agreement that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to $500
million.The interest rate ranges from LIBOR plus 075% to 125% or
Prime plus 05%.The revolving line of credit expires on March 23,
2010.The financial covenants require a minimum net worth of $1750
million and a cash flow leverage ratio of not more than 20 to
10.The commitment fees charged on the unused line of credit are
between 015% and 025%.
Our
unused and available borrowings under our bank revolving line of credit at
December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $471 million and $472 million,
respectively.We were in compliance with our debt covenants at
December 31, 2008.
We have
standby letters of credit that expire from 2009 to 2012.As of
December 31, 2008, our letters of credit were $29 million.

Total
rental expense included in general and administrative expense, which relates
primarily to real estate, was approximately $83 million, $77 million and $81
million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.Many of the real
estate leases contain renewal options and escalation clauses which require
payments of additional rent to the extent of increases in the related operating
costs.We straight-line rental expense in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, paragraph 15 and Financial Accounting
Standards Board Technical Bulletin 85-3.
In March
2006, we entered into a ten year lease agreement for a building and property
Comtraks Memphis facility with a related party, the President of
Comtrak.Rent paid under this lease agreement included in general and
administrative expense totaled $07 million, $07 million and $06 million for
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.The annual lease payments escalate
by less than 1% per year.
We incur
rental expense for our leased containers and tractors that are included in
Transportation Costs and totaled $121 million, $99 million, and $81 million
for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
We incur
charges for use of a fleet of rail owned chassis and dedicated rail owned
containers on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Norfolk Southern and Union
Pacific which are included in transportation costs.Such charges were
$454 million, $455 million and $428 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.As of December 31, 2008, we have the ability to return
the majority of the containers and pay for the chassis only when we are using
them under these agreements.As a result, no minimum commitments
related to these chassis and containers have been included in the table above.
Chassis charges included in accrued expenses-other as of December 31, 2008 and
2007 were $98 million and $114 million, respectively.

9.Stock-Based
Compensation Plans
In 1996, we adopted a
Long-Term Incentive Plan the 1996 Incentive Plan.The number of
shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1996 Incentive
Plan was 1,800,000.In 1997, we adopted a second Long-Term Incentive
Plan the 1997 Incentive Plan.The number of shares of Class A
Common Stock reserved for issuance under the 1997 Incentive Plan was
600,000.In 1999 we adopted a third Long-Term Incentive Plan the
1999 Incentive Plan.The number of shares of Class A Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the 1999 Incentive Plan was 2,400,000.In
2002, we adopted a fourth Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2002 Incentive
Plan.The number of shares of Class A Common Stock reserved for
issuance under the 2002 Incentive Plan was 2,400,000.In 2003, we
amended our 2002 Incentive Plan to add an additional 2,000,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock that are reserved for issuance.In 2007, we amended our
2002 Incentive Plan to add an additional 1,000,000 shares of Class A common
Stock that are reserved for issuance.Under the 1996, 1997, 1999 and
2002 Incentive Plans, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
and performance units may be granted for the purpose of attracting and
motivating our key employees and non-employee directors.The options
granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a three-year period and
expire 10 years after the date of grant.The options granted to
employees vest over a range of three to five years and expire 10 years after the
date of grant.Restricted stock vests over a three to five year
period.At December 31, 2008, 2,120,955 shares are available for
future grant.Generally, when stock options are exercised, either new
shares are issued or shares are issued out of treasury.
We
generally recognize the cost of share-based awards on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period of the award including an estimate of
forfeitures.Share-based compensation expense for 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $44 million, $39 million and $34 million or $27 million, $25 million
and $20 million, net of taxes, respectively.Share-based
compensation is included in Salaries and Benefits in the accompanying statements
of income.

During
2008, we granted 215,508 shares of restricted stock to certain employees and
10,644 shares of restricted stock to outside directors with a weighted average
grant date fair value of $2616.The stock vests over a three to five
year period.
During
2007, we granted 200,163 shares of restricted stock to certain employees and
10,644 shares of restricted stock to outside directors with a weighted average
grant date fair value of $2777.The stock vests over a three year
period.
During
2006, we granted 106,819 shares of restricted stock to certain employees with a
weighted average grant date fair value of $2158.The stock vests
over a three year period.
The fair
value of non-vested restricted stock is equal to the market price of our stock
at the date of grant.
The total
fair value of restricted shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 was $39 million, $39 million and $133 million,
respectively.
As of
December 31, 2008, there was $73 million of unrecognized compensation cost
related to non-vested share-based compensation that is expected to be recognized
over a weighted average period of 141 years.
In May
2006, the Board of Directors granted certain of our officers 593,542 performance
units.Due to attrition, there are currently 529,026 performance
units outstanding.The performance units entitle the recipients to
receive restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock contingent upon the
achievement of an operating income earnings target.The aggregate
operating income for the three year period ending December 31, 2008 must meet a
specified target amount in order for these performance units to be earned and
converted to restricted stock.No restricted stock will be awarded
and therefore no compensation expense associated with the performance units was
recognized.
During
January 2009, we granted 184,849 shares of restricted stock to certain employees
and 12,000 shares of restricted stock to outside directors with a weighted
average grant date fair value of $2701. The stock vests over a three to five
year period.

Benefit Plans
We had
two profit-sharing plans and trusts in 2008, 2007 and 2006 under section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code.At our discretion, we partially match
qualified contributions made by employees to the plan.We expensed
approximately $18 million, $19 million and $17 million related to these plans
in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
39
In
January 2005, we established the Hub Group, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation Plan the Plan to provide added incentive for the retention of
certain key employees.Under the Plan, participants can elect to
defer certain compensation.Accounts will grow on a tax-deferred
basis to the participant.Restricted investments included in the
consolidated balance sheet represent the fair value of the mutual funds and
other security investments related to the Plan at December 31, 2008 and
2007.Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in
income and expense and offset the change in the deferred compensation
liability.We provide a 50% match on the first 6% of employee
compensation deferred under the Plan, with a maximum match equivalent to 3% of
base salary.In addition, we have a legacy deferred compensation
plan.There are no new contributions being made into this legacy
plan.We expensed $03 million, $10 million and $08 million related
to the employer match for these plans in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.The liabilities related to these plans at
December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $88 million and $104 million,
respectively.

party to litigation incident to our business, including claims for personal
injury and/or property damage, freight lost or damaged in transit, improperly
shipped or improperly billed.Some of the lawsuits to which we are

14.Stock
Splits
The Board
of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split which was paid on June 6,
2006.All shares and per-share amounts have been retroactively
restated to give effect to the two-for-one stock split which was affected in the
form of a 100% stock dividend.In addition, all options and
performance units have been retroactively restated for the stock split in
accordance with the terms of the incentive plans.Each of our Class A
stockholders and Class B stockholders received one Class A share on each share
of Class A Common Stock and each share of Class B Common Stock held by them on
the record date in connection with the stock split.In accordance
with the terms of our Certificate of Incorporation, the number of votes held by
each stockholder of Class B Common Stock was adjusted in connection with this
stock dividend such that each share of Class B Common Stock now entitles its
holder to approximately 80 votes.Each share of Class A Common Stock
entitles its holder to one vote.

NOTE
15.Acquisition
At the
close of business on February 28, 2006, we acquired certain assets of Comtrak,
Inc. Comtrak, a transportation company whose services include primarily rail
and international drayage for the intermodal sector.Comtrak was
established in 1983 and is headquartered in Memphis,
Tennessee.Comtrak utilizes company drivers and third-party owner
operators to serve its customers.Comtrak had net sales of $871
million, including sales to Hub of $86 million, for the year ended December 31,
2005.The acquisition was consistent with our strategic plan to
increase the amount of local trucking or drayage we perform.We
have benefited from Comtraks diverse service offerings.In addition,
we have been able to perform more of our own drayage which our customers
value.We are also less vulnerable to the capacity volatility in the
marketplace.Due to these factors and the fact Comtrak had best in
class operations that we have implemented at our existing drayage operations, we
paid a premium or goodwill when we acquired Comtrak.
We paid
the $380 million purchase price plus a working capital adjustment of $12
million, which was finalized during 2006, in accordance with the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement, from available cash.There is an earn-out
mechanism for 2006 and 2007, which has been achieved for $100 million in total
and is based on Comtraks 2006 and 2007 EBITDA as defined in the Asset Purchase
Agreement.The additional contingent consideration of $50 million
for both 2006 and 2007 has been added to the purchase price and has been applied
to goodwill.The earn-out payments were considered additional
goodwill because 1 the payments are not affected if the former owner of Comtrak
is not employed at Hub, 2 the President of Comtrak received a compensation
package comparable to other key employees and 3 at the time of acquisition, the
contingent earn-out was determined based on our valuation of
Comtrak.The $50 million for both 2006 and 2007 have been
paid.The results of operations of Comtrak are included in our
consolidated statements of income for the period March 1, 2006 to December 31,
2006 and the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008.
The
Comtrak acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 Business
Combinations.Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at their fair values as of March
1, 2006.

purposes to be deductible over 15 years and for book purposes it has an
indefinite life.
