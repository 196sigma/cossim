Management of Manhattan Associates, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Companys internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
As of the end of the Companys 2015 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework COSO. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015 was effective.
Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys financial statements for the year ended December31, 2015, has audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015 and has issued a report regarding the Companys internal control over financial reporting appearing on page 38, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2015. s/ Eddie Capel Eddie Capel President and Chief Executive Officer February 5, 2016 s/ Dennis B.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 1. Organization, Consolidation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization and Business 
Manhattan Associates, Inc. Manhattan or the Company is a developer and provider of supply chain commerce solutions that help organizations optimize the effectiveness, efficiency, and strategic advantages of their supply chains. The Companys solutions consist of software, services, and hardware, which coordinate people, workflows, assets, events, and tasks holistically across the functions linked in a supply chain from planning through execution. These solutions also help coordinate the actions, data exchange, and communication of participants in supply chain ecosystems, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, trading partners, transportation providers, channels such as catalogers, store retailers, and Web outlets, and consumers. 
The Companys operations are in North America, Europe EMEA, and the Asia/Pacific APAC region. The European operations are conducted through the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries, Manhattan Associates Limited, Manhattan Associates Europe B.V., Manhattan France SARL, and Manhattan Associates GmbH, in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, respectively. The Companys Asia/Pacific operations are conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Manhattan Associates Pty Ltd., Manhattan Associates KK, Manhattan Associates Software Shanghai, Co. Ltd., Manhattan Associates Software Pte Ltd., and Manhattan Associates India Development Centre Private Limited in Australia, Japan, China, Singapore, and India, respectively. The Company occasionally sells its products and services in other countries, such as countries in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Asia, through its direct sales channel as well as various reseller channels. 
Stock Split and Increase of the Authorized Number of Shares of Common Stock 
On December19, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a four-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on December31, 2013 received three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date. The additional shares were distributed on January10, 2014 and trading began on a split-adjusted basis on January13, 2014. 
On May15, 2014, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Companys articles of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000. The amendment was effective on May15, 2014. 
All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been restated to reflect the effect of the four-for-one stock split for all periods presented.The Company retained the current par value of $001 per share for all shares of common stock. Stockholders equity reflects the stock split by reclassifying an amount equal to the par value of the additional shares arising from the split from Additional Paid-in Capital or Retained Earnings to Common stock. 
Principles of Consolidation and Foreign Currency Translation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into United States dollars in accordance with the foreign currency matters topic in the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification. Revenues and expenses from international operations were denominated in the respective local currencies and translated using the average monthly exchange rates for the year. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and the effect of changes in exchange rates from year to year are disclosed as a separate component of shareholders equity and comprehensive income. 45 New Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued guidance codified in Accounting Standard Codification ASC 606, Revenue Recognition Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which will replace substantially all current revenue recognition guidance once it becomes effective. The new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers unless the contracts are in the scope of other standards. The new standard is less prescriptive and may require software entities to use more judgment and estimates in the revenue recognition process than are required under existing revenue guidance. This guidance is now effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December15, 2017, using either of the following transition methods: ia full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or iia modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting the standard recognized at the date of adoption which includes additional footnote disclosures. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal Use Software Subtopic 350-40: Customers Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance will not change GAAP for a customers accounting for service contracts. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes to simplify the presentation of the deferred income taxes. The ASU requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The guidance does not change the existing requirement that only permits offsetting within a tax-paying component of an entity. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, but may be adopted earlier. We have not adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2015, but believe that the adoption of the ASU will not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash or cash equivalents. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments with various financial institutions. Amounts held are above the federally insured limit. 
The Companys sales are primarily to companies located in the United States, Europe and Asia. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and does not require collateral. Accounts receivable are due principally from large U.S., European and Asia Pacific companies under stated contract terms. Accounts receivable, net as of December31, 2015 for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC companies were $795 million, $127 million, and $52million, respectively. Accounts receivable, net as of December31, 2014 for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC companies were $692 million, $135 million, and $41million, respectively. The Companys top five customers in aggregate accounted for 8%, 10%, and 11% of total revenue recognized for each of the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 or for more than 10% of accounts receivable as of December31, 2015 and 2014. 
Fair Value Measurement 
The Company measures its investments based on a fair value hierarchy disclosure framework that prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of asset or liability and their characteristics. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows: Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. 
46 Level 2Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable. 
The Companys investments are categorized as available-for-sale securities and recorded at fair market value. Investments with maturities of 90days or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; investments with maturities of greater than 90days from the date of purchase but less than one year are generally classified as short-term investments; and investments with maturities of one year or greater from the date of purchase are generally classified as long-term investments. Unrealized holding gains and losses are reflected as a net amount in a separate component of shareholders equity until realized. For the purposes of computing realized gains and losses, cost is determined on a specific identification basis. 
At December31, 2015, the Companys cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments balances were $787 million, $397 million, and $104 million, respectively. Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market funds and certificates of deposit. Short-term investments consist of certificates of deposit. At December31, 2015, the Company has $198 million in certificates of deposit in India, which are included in cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company uses quoted prices from active markets that are classified at Level 1 as a highest level observable input in the disclosure hierarchy framework for all available-for-sale securities. At December31, 2015, the Company has $303 million in money market funds, which are classified as Level 1 and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has no long-term investments or investments classified as Level 2 or Level 3. 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon an evaluation of historical amounts written-off, the customers ability to pay, and general economic conditions; self-insurance accruals; impairment of goodwill; stock based compensation, which is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest; and the Companys effective income tax rate including the impact of unrecognized tax benefits and deferred tax assets, which are based upon the Companys expectations of future taxable income, allowable deductions, and projected tax credits. Actual results will differ from these estimates. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other financial instruments included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate their fair values principally due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on investments are included as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of any related tax effect, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Risks Associated with Single Business Line, Technological Advances, and Foreign Operations 
The Company currently derives a substantial portion of its revenues from sales of its software and related services and hardware. The markets for supply chain commerce solutions are highly competitive, subject to rapid technological change, changing customer needs, frequent new product introductions, and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete. As a result, the Companys position in these markets could be eroded rapidly by unforeseen changes in customer requirements for application features, functions, and technologies. The Companys growth and future operating results will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications that meet changing customer requirements that respond to competitive products and that achieve market acceptance. Any factor adversely affecting the markets for supply chain commerce solutions could have an adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and operating cash flows. 
The Companys international business is subject to risks typical of an international business, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax structures, other regulations and restrictions, and foreign exchange rate volatility. In addition, we have a large development center in Bangalore, India, that does not have a natural in-market revenue hedge to mitigate currency risk to our operating expense in India.Fluctuations in the value of other currencies, particularly the Indian rupee, could significantly affect our revenues, expenses, operating profit and net income. The Company recognized foreign exchange losses 
47 of $01 million and $04 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and a foreign exchange rate gain of $07 million in 2013. Foreign exchange rate transaction gains and losses are classified in Other income loss, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Companys revenue consists of fees from the licensing and hosting of software collectively included in Software license revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income, fees from implementation and training services collectively, professional services and customer support services and software enhancements collectively with professional services revenue included in Services revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and sales of hardware and other revenue, which consists of reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our professional services collectively included in Hardware and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. All revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes. 
The Company recognizes license revenue when the following criteria are met: 1a signed contract is obtained covering all elements of the arrangement, 2delivery of the product has occurred, 3the license fee is fixed or determinable, and 4collection is probable. Revenue recognition for software with multiple-element arrangements requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when athere is vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement that is not accounted for using long-term contract accounting, bVSOE of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement, and call other applicable revenue-recognition criteria for software revenue recognition are satisfied. For those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications, license revenue is recognized using contract accounting. 
The Company allocates revenue to customer support services and software enhancements and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on VSOE of fair value of each element, and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The balance of the revenue, net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement, is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered. If the Company cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the VSOE of fair value, the Company defers revenue recognition until all elements are delivered, all services have been performed, or until fair value can be objectively determined. The Company must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the VSOE of fair value for each element, considering the price charged for each product on a stand-alone basis or applicable renewal rates. For arrangements that include future software functionality deliverables, the Company accounts for these deliverables as a separate element of the arrangement. Because the Company does not sell these deliverables on a standalone basis, the Company is not able to establish VSOE of fair value of these deliverables. As a result, the Company defers all revenue under the arrangement until the future functionality has been delivered to the customer. 
Payment terms for the Companys software licenses vary. Each contract is evaluated individually to determine whether the fees in the contract are fixed or determinable and whether collectability is probable. Judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection, which is generally based on evaluation of customer-specific information, historical collection experience, and economic market conditions. If market conditions decline, or if the financial conditions of customers deteriorate, the Company may be unable to determine that collectability is probable, and the Company could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the Company receives customer payments. The Company has an established history of collecting under the terms of its software license contracts without providing refunds or concessions to its customers. Therefore, the Company has determined that the presence of payment terms that extend beyond contract execution in a particular contract do not preclude the conclusion that the fees in the contract are fixed or determinable. Although infrequent, when payment terms in a contract extend beyond our standard terms or twelve months, the Company has determined that such fees are not fixed or determinable and recognizes revenue as payments become due provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. 
The Companys services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services and customer support and software enhancements related to the Companys software products. Professional services include system planning, design, configuration, testing, and other software implementation support, and are not typically essential to the functionality of the software. Fees from professional services performed by the Company are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized as the services are performed. In certain situations, professional services are rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement. Revenue related to fixed-fee-based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement. The Company has determined that output measures, or services delivered, approximate the input measures associated with fixed-fee services arrangements. Project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known. Revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. 
48 Hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products, developed and manufactured by third parties, that are integrated with and complementary to the Companys software solutions. As part of a complete solution, the Companys customers periodically purchase hardware from the Company for use with the software licenses purchased from the Company. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, radio frequency identification RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. Hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes. The Company generally purchases hardware from the Companys vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, the Company generally does not maintain hardware inventory. 
In accordance with the other presentation matters within the Revenue Recognition Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC, the Company recognizes amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue. Such amounts have been included in Hardware and other revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was $202 million, $189 million, and $153 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
Deferred Revenue 
Deferred revenue represents amounts collected prior to having completed performance of professional services, customer support services and software enhancements, and significant remaining obligations under license agreements. The Company generally expects to complete such services or obligations within the next twelve months. 
Returns and Allowances 
The Company has not experienced significant returns or warranty claims to date and, as a result, has not recorded a provision for the cost of returns and product warranty claims at December31, 2015 or 2014. 
The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the historical experience of write-offs and a detailed assessment of accounts receivable. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue, which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue. The total amounts charged to operations were $71 million, $48 million, and $29 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers the age of the accounts receivable, the Companys historical write-offs, and the creditworthiness of the customer, among other factors. Should any of these factors change, the estimates made by management will also change accordingly, which could affect the level of the Companys future allowances. Uncollectible accounts are written off when it is determined that the specific balance is not collectible. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment is recorded at cost and consists of furniture, computers, other office equipment, internal use software, and leasehold improvements. The Company depreciates the cost of furniture, computers, other office equipment, and internal use software on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives three to five years for computer software, five years for office equipment, seven years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the term of the lease. Depreciation expense for property and equipment for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was approximately $73 million, $62 million, and $58 million, respectively, and was included in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Property and equipment, at cost, consist of the following in thousands: December 31 2015 2014 Office equipment 33,912 32,916 Computer software 18,809 17,351 Furniture and fixtures 4,100 3,022 Leasehold improvement 18,119 15,191 Property and equipment, gross 74,940 68,480 Less accumulated depreciation 53,764 51,215 Property and equipment, net 21,176 17,265 49 Software Development Costs 
Research and development expenses are charged to expense as incurred. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not capitalize any internal research and development costs because the costs incurred between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date when the product was available for general release to customers have been insignificant. 
The Company determines the amount of development costs capitalizable under the provisions of FASB Codification accounting for costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or marketed. Under this guidance, computer software development costs are charged to RD expense until technological feasibility is established, after which remaining software production costs are capitalized. The Company has defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which the Company has a detailed program design or a working model of the related product, depending on the type of development efforts, and high-risk development issues have been resolved through end-to-end system testing. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews the values assigned to long-lived assets, including property and certain intangible assets, to determine whether events and circumstances have occurred which indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be recoverable. In such reviews, undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not recognize any impairment charges associated with its long-lived or intangible assets. 
The evaluation of asset impairment requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment, and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. 
Goodwill and Impairment of Goodwill 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but instead tests goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill was $622 million at the end of each years ended December31, 2015 and 2014. Approximately $360million of the gross Goodwill balance is deductible for income tax purposes. To date, there have been no goodwill impairments. 
Impairment of Goodwill 
The Company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually as of December31 and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, 1a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, 2unanticipated competition, or 3an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. 
The Company applied the simplified goodwill impairment test for the fiscal year ended December31, 2015, that permits companies to perform a qualitative assessment based on economic, industry and company-specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units. Based on the results of the qualitative assessment, companies are only required to perform Step 1 of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is not more likely than not that the units fair value is less than its carrying amount. To the extent the Company concludes it is more likely than not that a reporting units estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount, the two-step approach is applied. The first step would require a comparison of each reporting units fair value to the respective carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The Company did not identify any macroeconomic or industry conditions as of December31, 2015, that would indicate the fair value of the reporting units were more likely than not to be less than their respective carrying values. If circumstances change or events occur to indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting units have fallen below their carrying value, the Company would test such reporting unit for impairment. The Company performed its periodic review of its goodwill for impairment as of December31, 2015 and 2014, and did not identify any impairment as a result of the review. 
Guarantees and Indemnities 
The Company accounts for guarantees in accordance with the guarantee accounting topic in the FASB Codification. Our customer contracts generally contain infringement indemnity provisions. Under those provisions, we generally agree, subject to certain 
50 exceptions, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with third party claims against the customer alleging that the customers use of our software products in compliance with their license infringe the third partys patent, copyright, or other intellectual property rights. Conditions to our obligations generally include that we are provided the right to control the defense of the claims and, in general, to control settlement negotiations. Those provisions generally provide also that, if the customer is prevented from using our software because of a third party infringement claim, our sole obligation in addition to the indemnification, defense, and hold harmless obligation referred to above is to, at our expense, iprocure for the customer the right to continue to use the software, iito replace or modify the product so that its use by the customer does not infringe, or, if either of the foregoing are not reasonably feasible, to terminate the customer contract and provide a refund of the unamortized portion of the customers license fee based on a five year amortization period. Our customer contracts sometimes also require us to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the customer in connection with death, personal injury, or property damage claims made by third parties with respect to actions of our personnel or contractors. The indemnity obligations contained in our customer contracts generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on liability. We have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations. We account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with FASB guidance on accounting for contingencies, and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. We have not recorded any liabilities for these contracts as of December31, 2015, or 2014. 
In general, in our customer contracts, the Company warrants to its customers that its software products will perform in all material respects in accordance with the standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the licensed products to the customer for six months after first use of the licensed products, but no more than 24months after execution of the license agreement. Additionally, the Company warrants to its customers that services will be performed consistent with generally accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed upon services. If necessary, the Company will provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history. However, the Company has not incurred significant recurring expense under product or service warranties. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is nominal. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of December31, 2015 and 2014. 
Segment Information 
The Company has three reporting segments: Americas, EMEA, and APAC as defined by FASB Codification topic for segment reporting. See Note 7 for discussion of the Companys reporting segments. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately $349,000, $168,000 and $154,000 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Advertising costs are included in Sales and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share 
Basic net income per share is computed using net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding Weighted Shares for the period presented. 
51 Diluted net income per share is computed using net income divided by Weighted Shares and the treasury stock method effect of common equivalent shares CESs outstanding for each period presented. The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of net income per share for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in thousands, except per share data stock split adjusted: Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 in thousands, except per share data Net income 103,475 82,000 67,296 Earnings per share Basic 141 109 088 Effect of CESs 001 001 002 Diluted 140 108 086 Weighted average number of shares Basic 73,443 74,995 76,664 Effect of CESs 595 846 1,268 Diluted 74,038 75,841 77,932 There were no anti-dilutive CESs in 2015, 2014 and 2013. See Note 2 for further information on those securities. 
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income includes net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on investments that are excluded from net income and reflected in shareholders equity. The entire accumulated other comprehensive income balance as of December31, 2015 and 2014 represents foreign currency translation adjustments. 2.Equity-Based Compensation 
Equity Based Compensation Plans 
As discussed in Note 1, on December19, 2013, our Board of Directors of the Company approved a four-for-one stock split of the Companys common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend.All references to stock award data have been restated to reflect the effect of the stock split for all periods presented. 
In May 2007, the Manhattan Associates, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan was approved by the shareholders of the Company and subsequently amended in May 2009 and May 2011. The 2007 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights. Vesting conditions can be service-based or performance-based, or a combination of both. 
As amended, a maximum of 30,000,000 shares are available for grant under the 2007 Plan. Each stock option or stock appreciation right granted is counted against the maximum share limitation as one share, and each share of restricted stock or restricted stock unit granted including those that are service based or performance based counts against the maximum share limitation as two shares. Options and stock appreciation rights cannot have a term exceeding seven years. As of December31, 2015, there were 11,923,068 shares available for issuance under the amended 2007 Plan. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The committee has the authority to interpret the provisions thereof. 
The restricted stock awards contain vesting provisions that are 50% service based and 50% performance based for employee awards and 100% service based for non-employee members of the Board of Directors Outside Directors. The employee awards have a four year vesting period, with the performance portion tied to annual revenue and earnings per share targets. The awards to Outside Directors have a one year vesting period. The Company recognizes compensation cost for service-based restricted awards with graded vesting on a straight-line basis over the entire vesting period, with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant-date value of the award that is vested at that date. For its performance-based restricted stock awards with graded vesting, the Company recognizes compensation cost on an accelerated basis applying straight-line expensing for each separately vesting portion of each award. 
In January 2012, in order to simplify equity grant administration, the Company changed its practice of granting restricted stock in favor of granting restricted stock units, or RSUs, which convert to the Companys common stock upon vesting. There is no material 
52 difference between the grant of restricted stock and the grant of RSUs to either the Company or the recipients receiving the grants; however, in contrast to the granting of restricted stock, no stock will actually be issued under the granting of RSUs until the units vest. The Company does not currently grant stock options. 
Restricted Stock and RSU Awards 
A summary of changes in unvested shares/units of restricted stock for the year ended December31, 2015 are as follows: Number of Shares/Units Grant Date Fair Value Outstanding at January 1, 2015 1,346,062 1843 Granted 579,954 5199 Vested 647,181 1849 Forfeited 73,302 2582 Outstanding at December 31, 2015 1,205,533 3409 The Company recorded equity-based compensation related to restricted stock and RSUs collectively restricted stock awards of $145 million, $97 million, and $71 million during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, based on market value at the vesting dates was $312 million, $239 million, and $268 million, respectively. As of December31, 2015, unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock awards totaled $227 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3 years. 
Included in the RSU grants for the year ended December31, 2015 are 137,294 units that have performance-based vesting criteria.As noted above, the performance criteriaare tied to the Companys 2015 financial performance.As of December31, 2015, the performance criteria for the fiscal year were met and the associated equity-based compensation expense has been recognized for the portion of the award attributable to 2015 services. 
Stock Option Awards 
The Company recorded equity-based compensation related to stock options granted prior to 2011 of $02 million during the year ended December31, 2013. No amounts were recorded for equity-based compensation expense related to stock options during the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014 as all stock options vested prior to 2014. The Company does not currently grant stock options. A summary of changes in outstanding options for the year ended December31, 2015 is as follows: Number of
Shares Weighted

Value in thousands Outstanding at January 1, 2015 153,764 478 Exercised 150,154 478 Outstanding at December 31, 2015 3,610 506 05 221 Vested or expected to vest at December 31, 2015 3,610 506 05 221 Exercisable at December 31, 2015 3,610 506 05 221 No stock options were granted in 2015, 2014, or 2013. 
As of December31, 2015, there is no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 based on market value at the exercise dates was $80 million, $89 million, and $139 million, respectively. 
53 3. Income Taxes 
The Company is subject to future federal, state, and foreign income taxes and has recorded net deferred tax assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2015 and 2014. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Significant components of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows in thousands: December 31 2015 2014 Deferred tax assets Accounts receivable 2,455 1,308 Accrued liabilities 7,671 8,481 Equity-based compensation 4,304 3,471 Capitalized costs 1,207 1,428 Accrued sales taxes 348 181 Deferred rent 1,344 2,238 State tax credits 4,339 3,848 Foreign subsidiary net operating losses 386 1,094 Valuation allowance 4,916 5,071 Other 695 449 17,833 17,427 Deferred tax liabilities Intangible assets 10,457 9,264 Depreciation 2,763 1,953 13,220 11,217 Net deferred tax assets 4,613 6,210 The components of income from domestic and foreign operations before income tax expense for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Domestic 152,040 118,448 94,336 Foreign 10,801 9,550 8,773 Total 162,841 127,998 103,109 The components of the income tax provision for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Current Federal 47,195 37,076 25,682 State 6,308 5,593 3,292 Foreign 4,331 5,034 3,674 57,834 47,703 32,648 Deferred Federal 1,252 1,490 2,877 State 300 375 341 Foreign 580 160 629 1,532 1,705 3,165 Total 59,366 45,998 35,813 The income tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options were approximately $27 million, $31 million, and $48 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 
54 As a result of losses in foreign locations, the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards NOLs of approximately $14 million available to offset future income. Approximately $13 million of the NOLs expire in 2016 to 2024 and the remainder does not expire. The Company has established a valuation allowance for substantially all of these NOLs because the ability to utilize them is not more likely than not. 
The Company has tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $67 million available to offset future state tax. These tax credit carry-forwards expire in 2017 to 2025. These credits represent a deferred tax asset of $43 million after consideration of the federal benefit of state tax deductions. A valuation allowance of $28 million has been established for these credits because the ability to use them is not more likely than not. 
Deferred taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $410 million, $357 million, and $314 million as of December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested; accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries. It is impractical to calculate the tax impact until such repatriation occurs. 
The following is a summary of the items that cause recorded income taxes to differ from taxes computed using the statutory federal income tax rate for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended December 31 2015 2014 2013 Statutory federal income tax rate 350 350 350 Effect of State income tax, net of federal benefit 25 27 20 State credit carryforwards 03 01 09 U.S. federal RD tax credit 07 09 20 Foreign operations 04 04 04 Tax contingencies 05 04 12 Other permanent differences 01 01 05 Change in valuation allowance 03 03 Income taxes 365 359 347 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 in thousands: December 31 2015 2014 2013 Unrecognized tax benefits at January 1 4,455 5,122 3,375 Gross amount of increases in unrecognized tax benefits as a
result of tax positions taken during a prior period 1,687 18 804 Gross amount of decreases in unrecognized tax benefits as a
result of tax positions taken during a prior period 292 508 61 Gross amount of increases in unrecognized tax benefits as a
result of tax positions taken during the current period 481 1,460 Reductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of
the applicable statute of limitations 61 658 456 Unrecognized tax benefits at December 31 5,789 4,455 5,122 The Companys unrecognized tax benefits totaled $58 million and $45 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in these amounts are unrecognized tax benefits totaling $40 million and $28 million as of December31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 
The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within its global operations in income tax expense. For the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recognized $02 million, $01 million, and 
55 02 million, respectively, of expense for the potential payment of interest and penalties. Accrued interest and penalties were $13 million and $08 million for the years ended December31, 2015 and 2014. The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United State federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is generally no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, and local, or non-US income tax examinations for the years before 2012. Due to the expiration of statutes of limitations in multiple jurisdictions globally during 2016, the Company anticipates it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by $05 million. 4. Shareholders Equity 
During 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company purchased 1,721,457, 2,620,118, and 2,831,520 shares of the Companys common stock for $1016 million, $911 million, and $592 million, respectively, through open market transactions as part of a publicly-announced share repurchase program. In January 2016, our Board of Directors increased the remaining share repurchase authority to $50 million. 5. Commitments and Contingencies 
Leases 
Rents charged to expense were $63 million, $63 million, and $59 million for the years ended December31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In 2014, the Company amended its Atlanta headquarters lease to obtain additional space and extend the lease term. As part of such lease agreement, the Company will receive reimbursement of $13 million from the landlord in 2018 for leasehold improvements. The entire cash rent obligation is being amortized to expense on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Aggregate future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases as of December31, 2015 are as follows in thousands: Year Ending December 31 2016 7,003 2017 7,282 2018 6,370 2019 5,211 2020 4,783 Thereafter 21,415 Total minimum payments required 52,064 There are no future minimum lease payments under capital leases as of December31, 2015. 
Legal and Other Matters 
From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its ordinary course of business, and occasionally legal proceeding not in the ordinary course. Many of the Companys installations involve products that are critical to the operations of its clients businesses. Any failure in a Company product could result in a claim for substantial damages against the Company, regardless of the Companys responsibility for such failure. Although the Company attempts to limit contractually its liability for damages arising from product failures or negligent acts or omissions, there can be no assurance that the limitations of liability set forth in its contracts will be enforceable in all instances. The Company is not currently a party to any ordinary course legal proceeding or other legal proceedings the result of which it believes is likely to have a material adverse impact upon its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company expenses legal costs associated with loss contingencies as such legal costs are incurred. 6. Employee Benefit Plan 
The Company sponsors the Manhattan Associates 401k Plan and Trust the 401k Plan, a qualified profit sharing plan with a 401k feature covering substantially all employees of the Company. Under the 401k Plans deferred compensation arrangement, eligible employees who elect to participate in the 401k Plan may contribute up to 60% of eligible compensation up to $18,000, as defined, to the 401k Plan. The Internal Revenue Service raised the eligible compensation limit to $265,000 for 2015.
