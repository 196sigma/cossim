To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Data Critical Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Data
Critical Corporation, a Delaware corporation the Company, and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Data Critical Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business
Data Critical Corporation, together with its subsidiaries, designs,
manufactures, markets, installs and supports communication and information
systems, using wireless and internet technology and proprietary software to
allow access to health information, including patient vital signs and other
diagnostic data. The Company systems provide for information retrieval from
remote sources, both inside and outside the hospital environment, and are
integrated and coordinated through either a wireless network utilizing an
interactive device, a personal computer or the internet. The Company focus
within healthcare is on the hospital, physician and at-home consumer markets.
On November 9, 2000, the Company announced a distribution agreement with
Medtronic Physio-Control Corp. that appoints Medtronic Physio-Control the
exclusive non-OEM distributor of the Company wireless alarm notification
systems for in-hospital use. Under the agreement, beginning January 1, 2001,
the parties expect that Medtronic Physio-Control will hire approximately 25
employees of the Company current hospital sales and implementation staff for
positions in Medtronic Physio-Control sales and service network, and
Medtronic will undertake a significant portion of the Company direct product
distribution.
Principles of Consolidation
The Company consolidated financial statements include the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Financial Statement Preparation
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity when
purchased of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market investments.
Inventories
The Company primary medical product is made up of the Company
proprietary software applications which it integrates with hardware that is
acquired from third parties as well as hardware made by third parties to the
Company specifications. Inventories consist primarily of the Company
hardware product, components to make the product and other third-party
equipment, all of which is stated at the lower of cost or market, using the
first-in, first-out method.
Property, Equipment and Software
Property, equipment and software are stated at historical cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five
54              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
years. Ordinary repairs and maintenance and purchases of less than $750 are
expensed as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of
the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Other Assets
Other assets include licensed intellectual and property rights which are
stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization provided on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful lives of the asset, generally seven years.
Other assets also include capitalized legal expenses associated with patent
applications. These costs will be amortized over their estimated useful lives
upon patent issuance by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Amortization
expense on other assets was $19,000, $17,000, and $104,000 in 1998, 1999 and
2000, respectively. Accumulated amortization was $47,000, $64,000, and $168,000
at December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangibles
Goodwill and intangibles includes technology purchased in the Physix, Elixis
and Paceart acquisitions see Note 10, which are stated at their fair market
values at the acquisition date less accumulated amortization provided on a
straight-line basis over three to ten years. Amortization expense on goodwill
and intangibles was $0, $17,000 and $1,177,000 in 1998, 1999 and 2000,
respectively.
Software Development Costs
Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Under this
standard, capitalization of software development costs generally begins upon
the establishment of technological feasibility, subject to net realizable value
considerations. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility
and the general availability of the software has been short; therefore,
software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been immaterial.
Through December 31, 2000, the Company had not capitalized any software
development costs.
Internal use software development costs are accounted for in accordance with
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of
Position SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use. Costs incurred in the preliminary project stage are
expensed as incurred and costs incurred in the application development stage,
which meet the capitalization criteria, are capitalized and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally five
years.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue recognition policies are in conformity with AICPA
SOP 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition as amended. License revenue is earned
when delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and determinable, evidence of an
arrangement exists, collection of the receivable is probable and no significant
post-delivery obligations remain. For sales to end users, revenue is recognized
upon installation. For sales to distributors, revenue is recognized upon
delivery. Maintenance and support revenue is recognized over the term of the
agreement.
The Company recognizes revenue from software development contracts involving
significant production, modification or customization of software, based on
performance milestones specified in the contract where these milestones fairly
reflect progress toward contract completion.                    55              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Deferred Revenue
Deferred revenue was $13 million and $18 million at December 31, 1999 and
2000, respectively. This deferred revenue resulted primarily from the
recognition of systems shipped but not installed and software maintenance fees.
The Company recognizes revenue that had been deferred upon shipment when the
system is installed and recognizes revenue from software maintenance agreements
generally over one year terms.
Major Customers
In January 1997, the Company signed a distribution and license agreement
with GE Marquette Medical Systems, Inc. now GEMS IT for the non-exclusive
licensing and distribution of a medical wireless data product. Approximately
545%, 185%, and 161% of the Company revenues for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, is attributable to GEMS IT.
Approximately 447%, 721%, and 45% of the Company revenue for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, is attributable to
Agilent Technologies, Inc. pursuant to a 1994 license agreement which provided
Agilent exclusive distribution rights to a specific implementation of the
Company medical wireless data technology.
Warranty Obligations
The Company generally provides product warranties for 12 months after date
of purchase. Estimated warranty obligations are provided at the time of the
sale of the Company products.
Royalty Expense
During 1997 and 1998, the Company entered into two nonexclusive licenses to
sell products using patented technology. In exchange for the licenses the
Company is required to make quarterly royalty payments based on the number of
products invoiced. Amounts charged to cost of revenue for the two nonexclusive
licenses were $142,000, $144,000, and $236,000 for the years ended 1998, 1999
and 2000, respectively.
Research and Development Costs
The Company accounting policy is to capitalize eligible computer software
development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which
the Company has defined as completion of a working model. The amount of
eligible costs to be capitalized has not been material and accordingly, the
Company has charged all software development costs to research and development
in the accompanying statements of operations.
Advertising Costs
Costs related to advertising the Company products are expensed in the
period incurred. Advertising costs incurred during the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 were $67,000, $49,000 and $366,000 respectively.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability
method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are
recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying
enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. To date,
the Company has fully reserved for its net deferred tax assets.                    56              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Stock Options
The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123,
the Company has elected the disclosure only provisions related to employee
stock options and follows the provisions of Accounting Principals Board Opinion
No. 25 APB 25 in accounting for stock options issued to employees. Under APB
25, compensation expense, if any, is recognized as the difference between the
exercise price and the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date,
which is typically the date of grant, and is recognized over the service
period, which is typically the vesting period.
The Company discloses the pro forma effect on net income as if it had
accounted for option grants to employees under the fair value method
prescribed by SFAS No. 123. The fair-value based model values stock options
using an acceptable valuation model. Pro forma compensation cost is measured at
the grant date based upon the fair value of the award and is recognized over
the service period, which is typically the vesting period.
Warrants and options granted to non-employees are accounted for under the
fair value provisions of SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash and trade receivables. The risk for cash and
cash equivalents is limited by the Company policy of maintaining cash and
equivalents in multiple, highly rated, liquid investments. The Company has
credit risk regarding trade accounts receivables as most of these receivables
are with healthcare institutions or with distributors to healthcare
institutions. To mitigate this risk, the Company has a credit policy under
which it verifies the creditworthiness of its customers.
Fair Value of Financial Instrument
The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments. The carrying amounts of capital leases and notes payable
approximate fair value as the stated interest rates reflect current market
rates. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
relevant market information about the financial instrument when available.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
Investments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates
Investments in corporate entities with less than a 20 percent voting
interest are generally accounted for using the cost method. The Company uses
the equity method to account for investments in corporate entities in which it
has a voting interest of 20 percent to 50 percent, or which it otherwise has
the ability to exercise significant influence, and for less than 501 percent
ownership in partnerships. Under the equity method, the investment is
originally recorded at cost and adjusted to recognize the Company share of
net earnings or losses of the investee, limited to the Company investment in,
advances to and financial guarantees for the investee.
Loss Per Share
In accordance with SFAS No. 128, Computation of Earnings Per Share, basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stock
net loss less preferred stock redemption obligation
57              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
accretion and dividend requirements by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is
computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stock by the weighted
average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding
during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of the shares of common
stock issuable upon the conversion of the mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon the exercise of
stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method; common equivalent
shares are excluded from the calculation as their effect is antidilutive.
Accordingly, basic and diluted loss per share are equivalent. The Company has
not had any issuances or grants for nominal consideration as defined under U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 98.

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. SFAS
No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and presentation of comprehensive
income and its components in consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 130
requires only additional disclosures in the financial statements; it does not
affect the Company financial position or results of operations. The Company
has no material components of other comprehensive loss.
Segment Reporting
The Company adopted SFAS No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, during 1998. SFAS No. 131 requires
companies to disclose certain information about operating segments. Based on
the criteria within SFAS No. 131, the Company has determined that it has two
reportable segments, Hospital Systems and Physician Systems.
Future Accounting Requirements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, issued SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS
No. 133 establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments
and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging
activities. In June 1999, FASB issued Statement No. 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date
of FASB Statement No. 133. Statement No. 137 defers the effective date of
Statement No. 133 for one year. Statement No. 133 is now effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Because the
Company currently holds no material derivative financial instruments and do not
currently engage in hedging activities, adoption of SFAS No. 133 is expected to
have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
In December 1999, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin: No. 101 Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements was issued. This pronouncement summarizes
certain of the SEC Staff views on applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition. SAB No. 101 is required to be adopted by the
Company for the year ended December 31, 2000. We believe the Company
practices are in conformity with this guidance.                    58              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
In March 2000, FASB released FASB interpretation No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25, which provides clarification of Opinion 25 for certain issues
such as the determination of an employee, the criteria for determining whether
a plan qualifies as a non compensatory plan and the accounting consequences of
various modifications of the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award.
We believe that the Company practices are in conformity with this guidance,
and therefore interpretation No. 44 has no impact on the Company financial
statements.
In March 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus, on
EITF Issue 00-3. This consensus indicates that a software element covered by
AICPA SOP 97-2 is only present in a software hosting arrangement if the
customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any
time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible
for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract
with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. Therefore,
AICPA SOP 97-2 only applies to hosting arrangements in which the customer has
such an option. Arrangements that do not give the customer such an option are
service contracts and are outside the scope of AICPA SOP 97-2. The Task Force
observed that hosting arrangements that are service arrangements may include
multiple elements that affect how revenue should be attributed. The Company
recognizes revenue related to software hosting as service is provided,
therefore this consensus has not had any material effect on the Company
results of operations or its financial position.

5. Debt Obligations Line of Credit
The Company had a secured bank line of credit with maximum available
borrowings of $15 million and with a variable borrowing base of 60% to 75% of
accounts receivable based on maintaining certain minimum financial covenants.
The line bore interest at the bank prime rate plus 075%. The Company had
outstanding letters of credit of $340,000 and $340,000, as of December 31, 1999
and 2000, respectively, but no outstanding borrowings against this line of
credit. The Company was required to comply with various financial covenants
including tangible net worth, liquidity ratios and maximum quarterly operating
losses. This line of credit expired in April 2000 and was not renewed.
Notes Payable
In April 1999, the Company established a subordinated debt facility totaling
$15 million. The six-month lending term expired in October 1999. Loans made
under this facility were secured by substantially all of the Company assets,
subordinated to the commercial bank loans. Advances under the subordinated debt
agreement were limited to $500,000 or more per advance. 110% interest-only
payments were payable for the first 12 months followed by 24 months of interest
plus equal monthly principal payments. As of December 31, 1999, $987,000 was
outstanding under this debt facility. This entire outstanding balance was
repaid in January 2000. In connection with this debt facility, the lender
received an option to purchase up to 105,000 shares of Series D preferred stock
at a purchase price of $500 per share. The lender exercised this option in
full on October 25, 1999.
60              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  The same lender has also provided a lease line of credit for up to $10
million, comprised of $800,000 to finance equipment and $200,000 to finance
equipment, leasehold improvements and software. Advances under the lease line
were available for 12 months beginning in April 1999 and became unavailable in
April 2000. Each advance was payable over 36 months in equal installments. The
Company had outstanding borrowings of $161,000 and $100,000 as of December 31,
1999 and 2000, respectively. As part of this lease line, the lender received a
warrant to purchase 12,500 shares of Series D preferred stock at an exercise
price of $400 per share.
The determination of fair value of the warrants issued in connection with
the Company various financing arrangements were made using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model and an effective borrowing rate of the Company.
In April 1999, the Company established a non-cancelable statutory finance
lease facility totaling $214,000. The finance lease agreements were funded in
three installments from April to August 1999 and secured by the leased
property. The leases are payable in 36 equal installments plus 166% interest
on the declining balances. The Company had outstanding borrowings of $179,000
and $114,000 as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively.
6. Capital Structure Common Stock
On November 9, 1999 the Company completed its initial public offering of
common stock. The Company issued 4,025,000 shares, including the underwriters
over-allotment, at $1000 per share for a gross offering of $40,250,000.
On June 5, 2000, the Company completed the sale of 1,230,770 shares of
common stock to a private investor, Investor. The Company raised $10
million in the sale of its shares to the Investor. In addition, the Company
granted the Investor a nine-month option the Option to purchase shares of
its common stock worth $10 million at a purchase price of $1500 per share if
the Option is exercised within 135 days of June 5, 2000 or $2000 per share
if the Option is exercised more than 135 days after June 5, 2000. This Option
expired unexercised in March 2001.
In November 2000, the Company initiated a stock repurchase program. As of
December 31, 2000, the Company had repurchased 765,500 shares of its common
stock on the open market at an average purchase price of $271 per share. Of
these repurchased shares, the Company reissued 56,333 to company employees at
an average price of $288 per shares.
Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Purchase Rights Plan
The Company has 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issue in
one or more series, at a par value of $0001. In July 2000 the Board of
Directors implemented a Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan Rights Plan to
protect stockholders' rights in the event of a proposed takeover of the
Company. Under the Rights Plan, the Company declared a dividend on each share
of outstanding common stock of one right a Right to purchase one one-
thousandth of a share of preferred stock for each share of the Company common
stock outstanding. Similar rights will generally be issued in respect to common
stock subsequently issued. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from the Company a one one-thousandth of a share
of the Company Series A Participating Preferred Stock, $0001 par value per
share, at a purchase price of $7500 subject to certain adjustments under the
plan. The rights are exercisable only if a person or group an Acquiring
Person acquires beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the Company
outstanding shares of common stock. Upon exercise, holders, other than the
Acquiring Person, will

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
have the right, subject to termination, to receive the Company common stock
or other securities, cash or other assets having a market value, as defined
equal to twice such purchase price. The Rights, which expire on July 21, 2010,
are redeemable in whole, but not in part, at the Company option at any time
for a price of $001 per Right.

7. Employee Benefit Plans Employee Savings and Retirement Plan
The Company has a 401k plan that allows eligible employees to contribute
up to 15 percent of their salary subject to annual limits. The Company
currently does not match any portion of the employees' contribution but may, at
its discretion, make matching contributions in the future.
Stock Option Plans
The Company has three stock option plans, the 1994 Stock Plan, the 1999
Stock Plan and the 1999 Directors Stock Plan collectively, the Plans. The
1994 and 1999 Stock Plans provide for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory
stock options to employees, directors and consultants. The 1999 Directors Stock
Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options to non-employee
directors of the Company. Options generally terminate if unexercised within 90
days after the employee leaves the company or, in the case of the 1999
Directors Stock Plan, 90 days after the director ceases to be a director of the
Company.
Under the 1994 and 1999 Stock Plans, options generally become exercisable at
the rate of 25% of the total number of shares underlying the options 12 months
after the vesting commencement date, and 25% every 12 months thereafter.
Options generally expire no later than ten years after grant, or five years in
the case of an incentive stock option granted to a 10% stockholder.                    62              DATA CRITICAL CORPORATION

issuance. No further options will be granted under the 1994 Stock Plan. Under
the 1999 Stock Plan, 1,000,000 shares plus an annual increase in each of the
next five years equal to the lesser of 250,000 shares or two percent of the
outstanding shares of common stock on the last day of the preceding fiscal year
of common stock have been reserved for issuance. In addition, the stockholders
of the Company approved in 2000 an increase of 500,000 in shares reserved for
issuance under the 1999 Stock Plan. Under the 1999 Directors Stock Plan,
100,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance.

shares of common stock if, on that date, he or she has served on the Company
board of directors for at least six months.

compensation is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period of the
options. In 1999 and 2000, the Company recognized $541,000 and $615,000,
respectively, of expense related to this deferred compensation. Up to the
Company initial public offering, the fair value of common stock on the dates

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method
prior to going public, which considers the time-value of money, with the
following assumptions for grants in 1998, 1999 and 2000: risk-free interest
rates of 625% to 650%; expected lives of five years; and no dividends. The
weighted average fair value of options granted in 1998, 1999 and 2000 were
$058, $738 and $647, respectively. The volatility number used for those
options granted between December 9, 1999 and December 31, 2000 was 070. The
pro forma effect upon net loss and net loss per share, taking into account only
the additional compensation expense that would be recognized using the fair
value method, are as follows in thousands, except per share data                           Year Ended December 31,

on the first day or the last day of each six-month offering period. Employees
may authorize the Company to withhold up to 20% of their compensation during

8. Income Taxes  At December 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $28,800,000. The Company may be limited in its ability to utilize
certain of its future carryforwards in any year due to previous sales of its
stock. Management believes that, based on a number of factors, the available
objective evidence creates significant uncertainty regarding the realization of
the net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been
provided for the net deferred tax assets of the Company. This valuation
allowance increased in 1998, 1999 and 2000 by $2,232,000, $2,662,000 and
$4,125,000 respectively. These carryforwards, which may provide future tax
benefits, expire from 2008 to 2020.
The difference between the statutory tax rate of approximately 365% 34%
federal and 25% state, net of federal benefits and the tax benefit of zero
recorded by the Company is primarily due to the Company full valuation
against its net deferred tax assets. In addition, the Company has research and
development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $500,000.

the Company issued 200,000 shares of common stock, all of which were placed in
escrow. Of these 200,000 shares, 100,000 shares were to be released if not
required to satisfy Physix indemnification obligations, and the other 100,000
shares the Contingency Shares were only to be released upon the achievement
of certain milestone obligations. If these performance milestones were not met
within one year, the number of Contingency Shares to be released to Physix were
to be reduced on a sliding scale, up to the total 100,000 shares, and the
unreleased shares were to be returned to the Company for retirement. The
Company also paid approximately $15 million in cash to repay certain Physix
obligations and assumed certain other Physix liabilities amounting to
approximately $600,000. In December 2000 the Company consented to the release
of all 100,000 Contingency Shares from escrow and accounted for the release
with an approximate fair value of $138,000 as additional purchase price.
This acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the
financial statements reflect valuation of all assets, including identifiable
intangibles, at their estimated fair market values. Physix results of
operations are included in the accompanying statements of operations from the
date of the acquisition.
Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to
the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair value. The following

segments. In accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, the Company is required to describe its
reportable segments and provide data that is consistent with the data made
available to the Company management to allocate resources and assess
performance. Information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to
the current year presentation.
The Company is organized on the basis of products and services. The
Company segments are divisions that offer different products and services.
Reportable segments are as follows   Hospital Systems-designs, manufactures, and markets systems and services
using technologies for use primarily within the hospital environment.
Physician Systems-designs, manufactures, and markets systems and
services using hand-held and internet-based wireless technologies primarily
for physician use.
The Company measures the performance of its operating segments based on
segment operating income, which includes sales and marketing expenses, research
and development costs, and other overhead charges directly attributable to the
operating segment. Certain expenses that are managed outside of the operating
segments are excluded from segment operating income. These consist primarily of
corporate charges, including other income and expense items, unallocated shared
expenses and taxes. Asset information by operating segment is not reported
since the Company does not identify assets by segment. The accounting policies
of the segments are the same as those used in the preparation of the Company
consolidated financial statements.
The Company does not have material revenues or assets outside the United
States. Approximately 992%, 906%, and 206% of the Company revenues for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively, is attributable to
sales to GE Marquette Medical Systems, Inc. now GEMS IT and sales co-marketed
with Agilent Technologies, Inc.
The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. EBITDA
includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments. Segment
data includes intersegment revenues. The table below presents information about
reported segments for the years ending December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000 in
