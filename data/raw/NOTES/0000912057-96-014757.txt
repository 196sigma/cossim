REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
U.S. Office Products Company
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of U.S. Office Products Company and its subsidiaries at April 30, 1996
and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended April 30, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance  about whether the financial  statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 1 -- BUSINESS ORGANIZATION
U.S. Office Products Company U.S. Office Products and the Company was
founded in October 1994 to create a nationwide office products supplier,
primarily to corporate, commercial and industrial customers.
Concurrent with the closing of its initial public offering the IPO in
February 1995, the Company acquired four companies for a combination of its
common stock and cash which are referred to herein as the Combined Companies
and acquired two companies in business combinations accounted for under the
purchase method. The six companies are referred to as the Founding Companies.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, U.S. Office Products acquired by
merger each of the Combined Companies the Mergers. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial
statements are representative of what the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows would have been if U.S. Office Products and the
Combined Companies had been combined on May 1, 1993. The assets and liabilities
of the Combined Companies are reflected at their historical amounts. Capital
stock of the Combined Companies is included in additional paid-in capital. The
Combined Companies previously reported on fiscal years ending other than April
30. Commencing on May 1, 1994, the fiscal year-ends were changed to April 30
which resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings during fiscal 1994 of $273
which resulted from revenues of $8,983 and expenses of $8,710.
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of U.S. Office Products,
the Combined Companies and the companies acquired in business combinations
accounted for under the purchase method the Purchased Companies from their
respective acquisition dates and give retroactive effect to the results of the
companies acquired  in business  combinations  accounted for  under  the
pooling-of-interests method the Pooled Companies for all periods presented.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
DEFINITION OF FISCAL YEAR
As used in these consolidated financial statements and related notes to
consolidated financial statements, fiscal 1996, fiscal 1995 and fiscal
1994 refer to the Company fiscal years ended April 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions
and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original maturities of
three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial  instruments  which  potentially  subject  the  Company  to
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
trade accounts receivable. The Company invests a portion of its cash in highly
rated corporate commercial paper with original maturities of 30 days or less and
in overnight
25
U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
investments collateralized by U.S. government securities. Receivables arising
from sales to customers are not collateralized and, as a result, management
continually monitors the financial condition of its customers to reduce the risk
of loss.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined
on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis and consist primarily of product held for
sale.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Additions and improvements are
capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of
property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The estimated useful lives
range from 25 to 40 years for buildings and its components and 5 to 15 years for
furniture, fixtures and equipment. Property and equipment leased under capital
leases are being amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or their lease
terms.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, which represents the excess
of cost over the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations
accounted  for under the  purchase method. Goodwill  is amortized on a
straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Management
periodically evaluates the recoverability of goodwill, which would be adjusted
for a permanent decline in value, if any, by comparing anticipated undiscounted
future cash flows from operations to net book value.
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the
year-end exchange rate, and statement of income accounts are translated using
the average exchange rate for the year. Translation adjustments are recorded as
a separate component of stockholders' equity.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company majority owned foreign subsidiary has entered into forward
foreign  currency  exchange  contracts  the  Exchange  Contracts with
counterparties to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations to the
extent permissible by hedge accounting requirements. At April 30, 1996, the
Exchange Contracts, in the notional amount of $4,616, hedge approximately $5,292
of foreign currency denomininated assets. Discounts or premiums on the Exchange
Contracts are amortized over the life of the contracts.
The Company majority owned foreign subsidiary has also entered into
interest rate swap agreements the Swap Agreements with counterparties to
convert the interest rates associated with certain outstanding debt from
variable rates to fixed rates. The notional amount of the Swap Agreements was
$43,000 at April 30, 1996. The market risks associated with these Swap
Agreements result from short-term fluctuations in interest rates. The credit
risks related to non-performance of the Swap Agreements by the counterparties
are not deemed to be significant, however, non-performance would result in the
Company terminating the Swap Agreements and recognizing a gain or loss,
depending on the fair market value of the Swap Agreements.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 107,
Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the Company has
estimated the fair value of its financial instruments using the following
methods and assumptions:
- The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable approximates fair value;
26
U.S. OFFICE PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
- The fair value of the 5 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2001 is
based on quoted market prices;
- The carrying amounts of the Company debt, other than the 5 1/2%
Convertible Subordinated Notes due  2001, approximates fair  value,
estimated by discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, except for one Combined Company and certain
Pooled Companies which were organized as subchapter S corporations prior to
being acquired by the Company. The asset and liability approach used in SFAS 109
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities.
TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS
No provision is made for U.S. income taxes on earnings of subsidiary
companies which the Company controls but does not include in the consolidated
federal income tax return since it is management practice and intent to
permanently reinvest the earnings.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon the delivery of office products to customers. The
Company also leases equipment to customers under both short-term and long-term
lease agreements. Revenue related to the short-term leases is recognized on a
monthly basis over the life of the lease. Certain long-term leases qualify as
sales-type leases and, accordingly, the present value of the future lease
payments is recognized as income upon delivery of the equipment to the customer.
COST OF REVENUES
Vendor rebates are recognized on an accrual basis in the period earned and
are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. Delivery and occupancy costs
are included as an increase to cost of revenues.
NONRECURRING ACQUISITION COSTS
Nonrecurring acquisition costs represent acquisition costs incurred by the
Company in business combinations accounted for under the pooling-of-interests
method. These costs include legal and accounting fees, investment banking fees,
recognition of transaction related obligations and various other acquisition
related costs.
DISCONTINUATION OF PRINTING DIVISION AT SUBSIDIARY
During fiscal 1996 the Company discontinued the printing division at one of
its subsidiaries and incurred a one time charge of $682, which consisted
primarily of the write down of printing division assets to their estimated
market value.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share for fiscal 1996 is calculated by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year
including common stock equivalents, if dilutive.
Net income per share for fiscal 1995 and fiscal 1994 has not been presented
as it is not considered meaningful due to the Mergers and the IPO in conjunction
with the formation of the Company during fiscal 1995.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123 established a fair value
based method of accounting for employee stock based compensation plans and
encourages companies to adopt that method. However, it also allows companies to
continue to apply the intrinsic value based method currently prescribed under
APB Opinion No. 25, provided certain pro forma disclosures are made. SFAS 123 is
not required to be adopted by the Company until fiscal 1997. The Company
currently intends to continue to apply the accounting method prescribed by APB
Opinion 25 and, accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 will not have a material
impact on the Company.
In March, 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. This statement requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. SFAS 121 is not required to
be adopted by the Company until fiscal 1997. The Company does not anticipate
that SFAS 121 will have a material effect on the Company operating results.

LITIGATION
The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the
normal course of its business. Management believes that none of this litigation
will have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.
POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS
The Company has entered into employment agreements with several employees
that would result in payments to these employees upon change in control or
certain other events. No amounts have been accrued at April 30, 1996 or 1995
related to these agreements.
NOTE 12 -- EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Certain subsidiaries of the Company have qualified defined contribution
benefit plans, which allow for voluntary pre-tax contributions by the employees.
The subsidiaries pay all general and administrative expenses of the plans and in
some cases making matching contributions on behalf of the employees. For the
fiscal years ended April 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, the subsidiaries incurred
expenses totaling $683, $450 and $220, respectively, related to these plans.
One Combined Company entered into agreements with three officers which
provided for future compensation to those officers subsequent to termination of
employment with the Combined Company for a period of five years. The future
compensation would not be received, however, in the event that an officer
received payment under that Company Restricted Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Planin excess of the purchase price of the stock paid by the
officer. No compensation expense was recorded with respect to the agreement
related to two of the officers, as it was probable that they would receive
payment under the Restricted Stock Purchase Plan. Future compensation expense of
approximately $1,030 was being recognized as expense for the third officer over
the estimated term of the officer service to the Company of approximately
eleven years. The compensation expense equaled $95 in fiscal 1994 and $71 in
fiscal 1995. The agreements were terminated upon closing of the Merger.
The Purchase Plan was considered to be compensatory, for the benefit of
certain officers. Two of these officers each purchased 1,000 shares of stock for
$1 under the Purchase Plan. The stock was restricted and could only be purchased
by the Combined Company at specified prices that varied upon the occurrence of
certain events. As a result, the Combined Company future compensation expense
of $1,398, under this Purchase Plan, was being recognized as expense over the
expected periods of the officers' future service to the Combined Company of 20
and 28 years. Compensation expense of approximately $60 and $45 was recognized
in fiscal years 1994 and 1995, respectively. The Plan was terminated upon
closing of the Merger.
NOTE 13 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

In October 1994, the Board of Directors and the Company stockholders
approved the Company 1994 Long-Term Compensation Plan the Plan. The
purpose of the Plan is to provide directors, officers, key employees and
