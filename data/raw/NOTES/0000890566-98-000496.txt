REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To HomeUSA, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HomeUSA,
Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the Company, as of December
31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Company as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
consolidated operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

HOMEUSA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
HomeUSA, Inc., a Delaware corporation HomeUSA or the Company, was
founded in July 1996 to become a leading national retailer of manufactured homes
and accessories. In November 1997, HomeUSA acquired, simultaneous with the
closing of an initial public offering the IPO, nine existing independent
retailers of manufactured homes. Consideration for these businesses consisted of
a combination of cash and common stock of HomeUSA, par value $01 per share the
Common Stock.
For financial statement presentation purposes, Universal Housing Group
Universal, one of the Founding Companies, has been identified as the
accounting acquiror. The acquisition of the remaining Founding Companies and
HomeUSA were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The
consolidated statements of operations reflect Universal for all periods
presented and the Founding Companies and HomeUSA since November 30, 1997, the
effective date used for accounting purposes. The allocation of purchase price to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been initially assigned and
recorded based on preliminary estimates of fair value and may be revised as
additional information concerning the valuation of such assets and liabilities
becomes available.
The Company has an absence of a combined operating history and HomeUSA
future success is dependent upon a number of factors which include, among
others, the ability to integrate operations, reliance on the identification and
integration of satisfactory acquisition candidates, reliance on acquisition
financing, the ability to manage growth, and attract and retain qualified
management and sales personnel as well as the need for additional capital and
the availability and cost of floor plan financing. Other factors include the
availability of sites for manufactured homes, dependence on key manufacturers,
availability of product, the availability of customer financing, risks
associated with increased regulation and competition, and the cyclical nature of
the manufactured housing industry.
On February 17, 1998, the Company announced it had entered into a
definitive agreement to be acquired by Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. See Note
15.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements reflect the Company on a historical basis with Universal as the
accounting acquiror. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using
the specific identification method for new and pre-owned homes.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. Property and equipment are recorded at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the
greater of the life of the lease or ten years.
Expenditures for major additions or improvements which extend the useful
lives of assets are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance and repairs
which do not improve or extend the life of such assets are charged to operations
as incurred. Disposals are removed at cost less accumulated depreciation, and
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Home sales consist of new and pre-owned manufactured
homes as well as retailer-installed options and setup and delivery. Retail home
sales are recognized upon passage of title and, in the case of credit sales
which represent the majority of the Company retail sales, upon the execution
of the loan agreement and other required documentation and receipt of a
designated minimum down payment. The Company also maintains pre-owned
manufactured home inventory owned by third parties for
21

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS
which the Company records a sales commission in other revenues when sold to
customers. Home sales exclude any sales and use taxes collected.
The Company receives an agent commission on insurance policies issued by
unrelated insurance companies. Insurance commissions are recognized in other
revenue at the time the policies are written.
The Company arranges financing for customers through various lending
institutions for which the Company receives certain financing fees, which are
recognized in other revenue along with the sale of the related home. Other
revenue also includes repair and maintenance services.
COST OF SALES. Cost of sales includes the cost of manufactured homes, less
any manufacturers rebates realized, as well as the cost of retailer-installed
options, set-up and delivery.
INCOME TAXES. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return,
which includes the operations of all acquired businesses for periods subsequent
to the respective date of acquisition. The stockholders of Universal elected to
be taxed under the provisions of Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under these provisions, Universal did not pay federal and certain state income
taxes. Instead, Universal stockholders paid income taxes on their
proportionate shares of the Company net earnings. Effective with the IPO,
Universal S Corporation status was terminated, and the Company is now subject
to federal income taxes. The provision for income taxes in 1997 includes a
charge of $40 representing the net deferred tax liability existing at the time
of the conversion to a C Corporation. Acquired companies each file a short
period federal income tax return through their respective acquisition date.
GOODWILL. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price
paid by the Company in the acquisition of the Founding Companies over the fair
market value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. As of December 31, 1997, accumulated
amortization was approximately $166.
The Company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangibles
resulting from business acquisitions and measures the amount of impairment, if
any, by assessing current and future levels of income and cash flows as well as
other factors, such as business trends and prospects and market and economic
conditions.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. The Company financial instruments
consist primarily of accounts receivable and floor plan payables. The carrying
amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to
length of maturity or existence of variable interest rates that approximate
market rates.
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. Financial instruments, which potentially
subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk, consist principally of
cash deposits and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances at
financial institutions which may at times be in excess of federally insured
levels. The Company has not incurred losses related to these balances to date.
MAJOR SUPPLIERS. The Company purchases all of its homes from three primary
suppliers at the prevailing prices charged by the manufacturers. The Company
sales volume could be adversely affected by the manufacturers' inability to
supply the sales centers with an adequate supply of homes.
The retail agreements between the sales center and the manufacturer contain
certain provisions, including the minimum amount of homes to be purchased and
displayed, guidelines for the display of model homes, installation and delivery
guidelines and terms of reimbursement for warranty work performed by the
retailer pursuant to the manufacturer warranty. These agreements also provide
for volume rebate incentive programs based on inventory purchases. Accordingly,
inventory has been recorded net of volume rebates. Retail agreements may be
terminated by the sales center with notice, or by the manufacturer for good
cause, as defined in the agreement.

USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known
to exist as of the date the financial statements are published and iii the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting
periods presented. The Company reviews all significant estimates affecting its
consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of
any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Adjustments made with
respect to the use of estimates often relate to improved information not
previously available. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and
assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements.
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the
net change in floor plan financing of inventory is reflected as an operating
activity.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. Effective January 1, 1998, the Company will
adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income. This statement requires the presentation of
total non-owner changes in equity, including items not currently reflected in
net income. Also effective January 1, 1998, the Company will adopt SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. This
statement requires that segments of a business be disclosed in interim and
annual financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect, if
any, these statements will have on the Company financial presentation.
3. BUSINESS COMBINATION AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION
The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the mergers

Folks and WillMax Homes of Colorado LLC Willmax together, the
Founding Companies. HomeUSA and the Founding Companies are hereinafter
referred to as the Company. These mergers the Initial Acquisitions
occurred simultaneously with the closing of HomeUSA IPO and were accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting with Universal, one of the Founding
Companies, as the accounting acquiror. The aggregate consideration paid by
HomeUSA in the Initial Acquisitions consisted of $181 million in cash at the
closing, $31 million paid subsequent to closing as a partial excess operating
capital distribution as defined and 7,266,944 shares of Common Stock,
including the 2,299,311 shares of Common Stock attributable to Universal. The
Company has recorded in the consolidated financial statements at December 31,
1997, an additional $41 million which it expects to pay during 1998 to the
stockholders of the Founding Companies representing excess operating capital as
defined as of the date of the Initial Acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma
information gives effect to the Initial Acquisitions and the IPO as if they had
occurred on January 1, 1996. The unaudited pro forma statement of operations
information also gives effect to the issuance of common stock in connection with
the IPO and as partial consideration for the acquisitions to the sellers of the
Founding Companies. The pro forma statement of operations information is based
on the historical financial statements of the Founding Companies and is also
based upon certain estimates and assumptions set forth below.

Pro forma adjustments primarily relate to i contractual agreements
entered into with suppliers, financing sources and previous owners of the
Founding Companies as a result of the Initial Acquisitions with respect to
combined manufacturers' rebates, floor plan financing interest costs, finance
income and owners' compensation differential, ii amortization of goodwill
recorded as a result of the Initial Acquisitions over a 40-year estimated life
and iii adjustments to the federal and state income tax provisions based on
the combined operations.
The pro forma adjustments are based on estimates, available information and
certain assumptions, and may be revised as additional information becomes
available. The unaudited pro forma information presented herein does not purport
to represent what the Company results of operations would have actually been
had such events occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, as assumed,
or to project the Company results of operations for any future period or the
future results of the Founding Companies. Previously reported pro forma amounts
for 1997 and 1996 have been revised based on additional information becoming
available subsequent to the IPO.
4. EARNINGS PER SHARE
EARNINGS PER SHARE -- In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. The Company adopted SFAS No.
128 for the year ended December 31, 1997. SFAS No. 128 simplifies the standards
required under current accounting rules for computing earnings per share and
replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share and fully diluted
earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share Earnings
per share -- Basic and diluted earnings per share Earnings per
share -- Diluted. Earnings per share -- Basic excludes dilution and is
determined by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Earnings per
share -- Diluted is equal to Earnings per share -- Basic, since the issuance or
conversion of additional common stock would have an anti-dilutive effect.
The computation of earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1995 is based upon 2,299,311 shares issued to Universal in conjunction with
the IPO. The computation of earnings per share for the year ended December 31,
1997 is based upon 3,739,593 weighted average shares outstanding which includes
i 2,299,311 shares issued to Universal in conjunction with the IPO, and ii
the weighted average portion of the remaining shares from the effective date of
the Initial Acquisitions and the IPO.
The computation of unaudited pro forma earnings per share for the year
ended December 31, 1997 is based upon i 10,441,887 shares issued to the
Founding Companies, management and Notre Capital Ventures II, L.L.C., ii
2,591,129 of the 5,000,000 shares sold in the IPO necessary to pay the cash
portion of the purchase price of the Founding Companies, iii 810,783 shares of
the 5,000,000 sold in the IPO necessary to pay the expenses of the IPO and iv
the weighted average of 1,598,088 shares of the 5,000,000 shares sold in the IPO
outstanding from November 21, 1997.

7. FLOOR PLAN FINANCING AND CREDIT FACILITIES
The Company has floor plan credit facilities with lending institutions to
finance a major portion of its manufactured home inventory until such inventory
is sold. Interest on amounts borrowed is paid monthly at varying rates from
prime to 75% over prime 85 to 160 percent at December 31, 1997. The floor
plan
25
HOMEUSA, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS
payable is secured by substantially all of the Company manufactured home
inventory, the related furniture, fixtures and accessories and accounts
receivable.
Floor plan payables are due upon receipt of sale proceeds from the related
inventory; however, the Company must make periodic payments when the related
home remains in inventory beyond the length of time specified in the floor plan
agreement. Generally, in the event the home remains in inventory 12 months after
the date of purchase, the balance of the obligation related to the home will
become payable over a specified term. In addition, the Company floor plan
agreements include subjective acceleration clauses which could result in the
lines of credit being due on demand should the Company experience a material
adverse change in its financial position as determined by the lender. The
maximum amount available under the various floor plan credit facilities at
December 31, 1997 was approximately $735 million. The largest floor plan
balance outstanding during the twelve months ended December 31, 1997, was
approximately $45 million. The average balance outstanding during the twelve
months ended December 31, 1997 was approximately $10 million, with a weighted
average interest rate of 106%.
In January 1998, the Company began using two credit facilities the
Facility which provide up to $125 million of revolving credit facilities
for floor plan financing at rates which vary from the prime rate to 1% below the
prime rate. The Facility will require the Company to comply with various
affirmative and negative covenants including, but not limited to i maintenance
of certain financial ratios, ii a restriction on additional indebtedness and
iii restrictions on liens, guarantees, advances, dividends and business
activities unrelated to its existing operations. Failure to comply with such
covenants and restrictions would constitute an event of default under the
Facility.
In February 1998, the Company entered into a $25 million revolving credit
agreement the Credit Facility with a bank to fund working capital
requirements and future acquisitions. The Credit Facility is secured by the
capital stock of the Company subsidiaries, and matures in February 2001.
Interest is payable monthly on any outstanding balance and is based on either
the bank prime rate or a Eurodollar rate. A commitment fee of 50% is payable
on the unused portion of the facility. The Credit Facility contains certain
affirmative and negative covenants including, but not limited to, maintenance of
certain financial ratios and minimum consolidated net worth. In addition, the
Credit Facility requires the Company to seek the lenders approval regarding
certain acquisitions. No borrowings have been made under the Credit Facility.

8. LONG-TERM DEBT
At December 31, 1997, consolidated long-term debt has been classified as

11. STOCK OPTIONS
1997 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
No stock options were granted to, exercised by or held by any executive
officer in 1996. In July 1997, the HomeUSA Board of Directors and stockholders
approved the 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP. The purpose of the
LTIP is to provide directors, officers, key employees, consultants and other
service providers with additional incentives by increasing their ownership
interests in the Company. Individual awards under the LTIP may take the form of
one or more of: i either incentive stock options or non-qualified stock
options NQSOs, ii stock appreciation rights; iii restricted or
deferred stock, iv dividend equivalents and v other awards not otherwise
provided for, the value of which is based in whole or in part upon the value of
the Common Stock.
The Compensation Committee will administer the LTIP and select the
individuals who will receive awards and establish the terms and conditions of
those awards. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be subject
to outstanding awards, determined immediately after the grant of any award, may
not exceed the greater of 2,000,000 shares or 15% of the aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding. Shares of Common Stock which are
attributable to awards which have expired, terminated or been canceled or
forfeited are available for issuance or use in connection with future awards.
At the closing of the IPO, NQSOs to purchase a total of 650,000 shares of
Common Stock were granted to members of management and 956,563 shares were
granted to certain employees of the Founding Companies. In addition, options to
purchase 80,000 shares were subsequently granted to employees of HomeUSA. Each
of the foregoing options have an exercise price of $800 per share. These
options will vest at the rate of 20% per year, commencing on the first
anniversary of the date of grant, and will expire at the earlier of ten years
from the date of grant or three months following termination of employment.
The Company LTIP provides for the granting or awarding of stock options
and stock appreciation rights to non-employee directors, officers and other key
employees. The Company accounts for this LTIP under APB Opinion No. 25, and no
compensation expense has been recognized. The number of shares authorized and
reserved for issuance under the LTIP is limited to the greater of 2,000,000
shares or 15 percent of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
last day of the preceding calendar quarter 2,000,000 shares at December 31,
1997. As of December 31, 1997, the Company has granted 10 year options covering
an aggregate of 1,606,563 shares of Common Stock.
The following table summarizes activity under the LTIP for the year ended

If the Company had recorded compensation cost for the LTIP consistent with
SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per share would have been decreased by the
following pro forma amounts in thousands, except per share data                        YEAR ENDED

The pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be
expected in future years because options vest over several years and addditional
awards may be made each year.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model, with the following average assumptions
used for grants in 1997: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 4803 risk-free interest rate of 587%; and expected lives of 10 years.
1997 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS' STOCK PLAN
The Company 1997 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Plan the Directors'
Plan, which was adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by the
stockholders in July 1997, provides for i the automatic grant to each of the
four non-employee directors serving at the consummation of the IPO of an option
to purchase 10,000 shares, ii the automatic grant to each other non-employee
director of an option to purchase 10,000 shares upon such person initial
election as a director, and iii an automatic annual grant to each non-employee
director of an option to purchase 5,000 shares at each annual meeting of
stockholders thereafter at which such director is re-elected or remains as a
director, unless such annual meeting is held within three months of such
person initial election as a director. All options have an exercise price per
share equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant
and are immediately vested and expire on the earlier of ten years from the date
of grant or one year after termination of service as a director. The Directors'
Plan also permits non-employee directors to elect to receive, in lieu of cash
directors' fees, shares or credits representing deferred shares at future
settlement dates, as selected by the director. The number of shares or deferred
shares received will equal the number of shares of Common Stock which, at the
date the fees would otherwise be payable, will have an aggregate fair market
value equal to the amount of such fees.

outlets for Fleetwood in the period preceding the closing.
Promptly after the Company publicly announced its proposed merger with
Fleetwood a complaint the Complaint was filed against the Company, the
members of its Board of Directors, and Fleetwood in a Delaware Court of Chancery
in New Castle County. The Complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of a
stockholder of the Company, individually and as a representative of a class of
holders of the Company Common Stock. The suit seeks certification as a class
action. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that by entering into the
Fleetwood Merger Agreement, the Company and the members of its Board of
Directors did not act reasonably and in compliance with their fiduciary duties
to the Company stockholders. The Complaint seeks to enjoin the proposed
Fleetwood Merger and seeks rescissory and/or compensatory damages, attorneys'
fees and other relief.
