ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The information required by this Item is incorporated herein by reference to
Pages 14through 33 of the Company 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders.                    12 Item 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter.                   PART II Item 5.A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon
that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that a material weakness existed in our internal controls over
financial reporting and consequently our disclosure controls and procedures were
not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report in
timely alerting them as to material information relating to our Company
including our consolidated subsidiaries required to be included in this Annual
Report.
The material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 27, 2005 related to the fact that as a smaller public company, Benihana
Inc. had an insufficient number of personnel with clearly delineated and fully
documented responsibilities and with the appropriate level of accounting
expertise and insufficient documented procedures to identify and prepare a
conclusion on matters involving material accounting issues and to independently
review such conclusions as to the application of generally accepted accounting
principles. The lack of a sufficient number of personnel is not a sustainable
model for an internal control structure designed for external reporting
purposes. Among the factors management considered in determining whether a
material weakness existed was the restatement of its previously issued financial
statements for the classification of bank indebtedness between long-term and
short-term liabilities as a result of having a misunderstanding that a verbal
waiver of a loan covenant from its lender was insufficient to provide an
accounting basis to classify the debt as long-term and for issues regarding its
lease accounting. For these reasons, management has determined that a material
weakness in the effectiveness of the Company internal controls over financial
reporting existed as of March 27, 2005. For more information, please refer to
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING included in
this Annual Report.
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management report on our internal control over financial reporting as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act, and
the related report of our independent public accounting firm, are included in
our Annual Report under the headings MANAGEMENTS' REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING and REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, respectively, and are
incorporated by reference.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING - MANAGEMENT'S REMEDIATION
OF THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS
Since March 27, 2005, to remediate this identified material weakness, management
has hired a controller who has an appropriate level of accounting experience and
education and who was, immediately prior to his employment with the Company, the
director of a major restaurant company financial reporting process. The
Company has engaged a registered public accounting firm to consult on matters
involving complex or emerging accounting issues. Benihana Inc. will continue to
utilize, as necessary, the assistance of outside accounting experts when
encountering technically complex accounting issues. We believe that reliance on
such expert advice is a customary and acceptable part of maintaining sound
internal controls over financial reporting and will continue to utilize such
advice as part of our internal control procedures when considering unusual
issues for which the proper accounting treatment must be determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Documentation to
clearly delineate financial reporting responsibilities and procedures is being
prepared. The expenses associated with such remediation are not expected to be
material.
