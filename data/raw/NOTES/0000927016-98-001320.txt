NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS BUSINESS   Boron, LePore & Associates, Inc. the Company provides outsourced
promotional, marketing and educational services to the pharmaceutical industry.
The Company was founded in 1981 and has become a leading provider of peer-to-
peer meetings, which typically involve gatherings of 10 to 12 physicians
meeting under the chairmanship of a Company moderator to discuss a new drug or
new indication for a familiar drug. The Company also provides meetings such as
symposia, continuing education conferences and video satellite conferences;
product marketing services; teleservices such as teledetailing, telemarketing,
sales support and fulfillment; contract sales services; and, field force
logistics services.
INCORPORATION AND MERGER   On November 22, 1996, BLA Acquisition Corporation BLA was incorporated
in the State of Delaware. On November 27, 1996, the stockholders of BLA and the
stockholders of Boron, LePore & Associates, Inc., all under common control,
unanimously approved the Agreement and Plan of Merger Merger Agreement of
the two companies. On December 3, 1996, the merger became effective and was
accounted for comparable to a pooling of interests. The surviving corporation
was BLA, which subsequently changed its name to Boron, LePore & Associates, Inc.
the Company.
On December 4, 1996, the Company amended and restated its certificate of
incorporation to include the authority to issue 26,400,000 shares of common
stock.
On September 24, 1997, the Company completed the initial public offering of
3,735,000 shares including the underwriters' over allotment of 135,000 shares
of Common Stock at $1750 per share resulting in net proceeds, after underwriter
commissions and offering costs, of approximately $59,800,000 the Offering.
Of these net proceeds, approximately $19,600,000 was used to retire outstanding
debt and pay related interest expense, approximately $10,800,000 was used to
redeem all shares of Redeemable Preferred Stock and related accumulated
dividends and approximately $5,600,000 was used to purchase 466,666 shares of
Common Stock from a former officer of the Company.
In connection with the Offering, the authorized stock of the Company was
increased on September 22, 1997 to 50,000,000 shares of $01 par value common
stock and 2,000,000 shares of $01 par value preferred stock. Upon completion
of the Offering, all outstanding shares of non-voting Class A Common Stock
converted into shares of Common Stock. Also upon completion of the Offering,
the Convertible Participating Preferred Stock of the Company converted into
4,666,664 shares of Common Stock and 5,600,000 shares of Redeemable Preferred
Stock which, as described above, was redeemed with a portion of the net proceeds
of the Offering.
All share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a two-for-
three reverse stock split which occurred on September 11, 1997.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USE OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
28
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
REVENUE RECOGNITION   Revenue is recognized as services are performed. For conferencing services,
revenue is recognized upon completion of the meeting or symposia. Revenue for
multiple-meeting projects is attributed to individual meetings, based on an
average amount per meeting, and is recognized as individual meetings are
completed. Revenue for product marketing services is recognized in the period
contractual performance benchmarks are achieved and confirmed by the client.
Revenue for teleservices and field force logistics services are recorded in the
period the services are performed, based on the specific terms of the contract.
Customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms. Items which
are invoiced prior to performance of the related services are recorded as
deferred revenue and are not recognized as revenue until the required service is
provided, in accordance with the Company revenue recognition policy.
The Company is entitled to performance incentives under certain contracts.
The additional revenues are computed based on a formula specified in each
contract and are primarily dependent upon increases in market share for a
client product. The market share statistics are measured over a future period
of time specified in the contract. If the contract permits invoicing for
portions of the performance incentives prior to the calculation of actual market
share results, the revenues are deferred at the time of invoicing. Performance
incentive revenues that were invoiced at December 31, 1997 and December 31, 1996
approximated $730,000 and $1,070,000, respectively, and are reflected as
billings in excess of costs in the accompanying balance sheets.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION   Depreciation and amortization is provided on the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally a three to ten year
period. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while
renewals and betterments are capitalized.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS   Intangible assets generally represent non-compete agreements and deferred
financing costs. Such assets are amortized over the term of the related
agreement or debt instrument. During December 1996, as part of a Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement see Note 13, the Company incurred certain financing
costs related to the transaction. The costs were comprised primarily of
commitment fees related to long-term debt financing costs and totaled $312,500.
Such amount was being amortized over the life of the debt instrument. During
September 1997, in conjunction with the Offering and the settlement of all
outstanding bank debt Note 4, the Company wrote-off the remaining balance of
unamortized deferred financing costs, which amounted to approximately $270,000.
INCOME TAXES   On December 4, 1996, the Company began operations as a Delaware corporation
and was subject to Federal and state corporate tax rates as a C corporation
see Note 8. The Company has adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities, tax credit carryforwards and operating loss
carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax
assets if it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be
realized. For all periods prior to December 4, 1996, the shareholders of the
Company were treated as an S corporation for both Federal and state income tax
purposes, and accordingly the provision for income taxes for all periods ending
on or prior to such date reflects only certain state taxes.
29
LONG-LIVED ASSETS   During 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-lived
Assets SFAS 121. SFAS 121 requires, among other things, that an entity
review its long-lived assets and certain related intangibles for impairment
whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. As a result of its review, the Company does not
believe that any impairment currently exists related to its long-lived assets.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION   During 1996, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123. SFAS 123 requires that an entity account for employee stock compensation
under a fair value based method. However, SFAS 123 also allows an entity to
continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock-based compensation
using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees Opinion 25. Entities
electing to remain with the accounting under Opinion 25 are required to make pro
forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
based method of accounting under SFAS 123 had been applied See Note 14.
EARNINGS PER SHARE   In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128
which requires the presentation of basic earnings per share Basic EPS and
diluted earnings per share Diluted EPS. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period adjusted to reflect potentially
dilutive securities. The Company has implemented SFAS 128 as of December 31,
1997 See Note 3.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT   During 1996, the Company entered into a borrowing agreement with a bank.
The borrowing agreement provided for a $5,000,000 revolving credit facility and
a $20,000,000 term loan the Credit Facility. As of December 31,1996 1,000,000 was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under
the revolving credit facility are due on December 31, 2001. The interest rates
on the loans vary and are a function of the stated LIBOR rate and the effective
prime rate as defined in the Agreement. In September 1997, in conjunction with
the Offering, the Company repaid the then outstanding balance of the term loan 19,500,000, and the $1,000,000 revolving credit facility. In connection with
this debt repayment, the Company wrote-off the balance of unamortized deferred
financing costs related to the credit facility, resulting in a charge of
approximately $270,000. In 1997, the Company amended certain covenants to allow
for anticipated increases in capital expenditures. As of December 31, 1997,
there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and
$5,000,000 was available for future borrowings.

LITIGATION   The Company, from time to time, is involved in legal proceedings incurred in
the normal course of business. The Company believes none of these proceedings
will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or liquidity of
the Company. Additionally, a former shareholder and officer of the Company has 
sent correspondence to the Company alleging securities and common law fraud and
breach of contract by senior officers of the Company in connection with the
settlement of contractual arrangements with the former shareholder/officer in
December, 1996. The Company believes the allegations of the former
shareholder/officer are without merit and intends to contest them vigorously
should litigation be commenced against the Company, its officers or other
personnel. The Company does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, although
there can be no assurance that this will be the case.
32
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS   The Company has entered into employment agreements with its executive
officers and certain other senior management employees, some of whom are
stockholders of the Company. The agreements specify duties, benefits,
confidentiality and miscellaneous other provisions. The employment agreements
generally have initial terms of no greater than three years, with one year
renewals after such initial term. During 1997, two officers of the Company
became consultants and their employment agreements were amended. At December

$13,400,000 18% of total revenue for the year ending December 31, 1997.
Revenue from three customers accounted for approximately $17,600,000 44 6,300,000 16% and $4,100,000 10% of total revenue for the year ending

Major customers accounted for approximately $12,500,000, or 56%, and
$12,200,000, or 80%, of accounts receivable at December 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
10. DUE FROM AFFILIATES   In January 1996, the amounts due at December 31, 1995 from a former
affiliate were converted into a $1,000,000 promissory note bearing interest at
81% per annum payable in quarterly installments over six years. During 1996,
additional liabilities were satisfied by the Company on behalf of the former
affiliate and payments were received according to terms. On December 4, 1996,
the Company agreed to sell the amounts due from the former affiliate,
approximately $1,560,000 plus interest, to certain officers/stockholders of the
Company for $500,000. The balance of the amount was recorded as a nonrecurring
loss on forgiveness of related party loan in the accompanying statement
operations. The $500,000 was received by the Company from the stockholders,
pursuant to the terms contained in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement see
Note 13 in the form of bonus compensation payments of approximately $865,000
which provided the stockholders with the after-tax funds to make the repayment.
11. DUE FROM OFFICERS/STOCKHOLDERS   On June 30, 1995, the Company loaned three officers/stockholders amounts
aggregating approximately $672,000. In January 1996, the Company forgave a
portion of the loan and accrued interest of approximately $194,000 due from a
stockholder as part of a stock repurchase agreement. The remaining loans,
bearing interest of 8% per annum, were payable in five equal installments due on
June 30 of each year. The total amount due from officers of approximately
$435,000, including accrued interest of $14,000, was repaid pursuant to the
terms contained in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement see Note 13 in the
form of bonus 
compensation payments of approximately $761,000 which provided the officers with
the after-tax funds to make the repayment.
34
12. PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK   In January 1996, the Company paid a minority stockholder $450,000 and
forgave the stockholder loan receivable and accrued interest of approximately
$194,000 in exchange for the stockholder 1,548,387 shares of common stock.
The shares were held in treasury at a cost of $643,674. Additionally, in
January 1996, the remaining stockholders of the Company sold their shares of
common stock in an affiliated company. Subsequent to these transactions there
was no longer a common ownership relationship between the two companies.
Concurrent with the Merger Agreement see Note 1, the stock held in treasury
was retired on December 4, 1996 and the $643,674 cost was transferred to
retained earnings on that date.
On June 18, 1996, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to
repurchase 1,720,430 shares of common stock from a stockholder. The agreement
also contained a Disposition Benefit Agreement. The stockholder was a former
officer of the Company and the brother of the Company current Chief Operating
Officer. The Disposition Benefit Agreement would only become effective if there
was a sale of a controlling interest of the outstanding stock within a certain
period of time. The stock was purchased with a promissory note payable over
five years with monthly payments of principal and interest of $10,417 and annual
payments of $125,000, including interest, commencing on January 1, 1997. The
shares were held in treasury at a cost of $970,000, the net present value of the
promissory note. Concurrent with the Merger Agreement on December 4, 1996, the
treasury shares were canceled, the cost of the shares was transferred to paid-in
capital and retained earnings and the former stockholder received a payment of
$6,175,000 on that date. The terms of the transaction were the result of arms-
length negotiations.
Concurrent with the closing of the sale of the preferred shares and with
financing provided by a bank, the Company redeemed 3,7333,333 shares of common
stock from two individual shareholders for payments aggregating $18,850,000
pursuant to the terms contained in the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.
In September 1997, the Company paid a former officer of the Company
approximately $5,600,000 to repurchase 466,666 shares of common stock and to
amend the employment agreement of such former officer. At December 31, 1997, the
shares are held in treasury at a cost of approximately $5,500,000.
13. PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND STOCK REDEMPTION   On December 4, 1996 a Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement was entered into,
between the Company and certain investment partnerships and individuals
collectively the Investors. The Company sold 7,000,000 shares of its
authorized $001 par value Convertible Participating Preferred Stock for
$12,500,000. The Convertible Participating Preferred Stock had a minimum
liquidation value of $10,000,000 and was convertible to common stock and
redeemable preferred stock at various rates based on the occurrence of certain
events. In addition, the holders of the Convertible Participating Preferred
Stock were entitled to receive an annual cash dividend of approximately $01429
per share. The convertible participating preferred shares have voting rights
similar to common stock and are subject to certain liquidating and redemption
features, as defined, at the option of the holder.
In September 1997, upon completion of the Company Offering see Note 1,
the 7,000,000 shares of Convertible Participating Preferred Stock converted into
4,666,666 shares of Common Stock and 5,600,000 shares of Redeemable Preferred
Stock. The Redeemable Preferred Stock was immediately redeemed for $10,000,000
plus accumulated dividends of approximately $831,000.
14. STOCK OPTION AND GRANT PLAN AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN   During 1996 the Boron, LePore & Associates 1996 Stock Option and Grant Plan
the Plan was established. In August, 1997, the Plan was amended to increase
the shares of stock reserved for issuance under 
35
the Plan to 3,000,000 shares. As of December 31, 1997 there were 731,559 options
granted under the Plan. The following summarizes stock option activity since
establishment of the Plan                               Weighted

On December 4, 1996, two officers of the Company exercised their rights to
purchase 400,000 shares of Common Stock under the Plan. The exercise price
established by the Company Compensation Committee on December 4, 1996 grant
date was $0428 per share. The Company received $171,000 in payment for the
400,000 shares on December 4, 1996. The Company paid bonus compensation to the
two officers on December 4, 1996 of approximately $301,000 which provided them
with the after-tax funds to make the purchase.
On December 4, 1996, four officers of the Company exercised their rights to
purchase collectively 666,666 shares of Class A Common Stock under the terms and
conditions in the Plan. The exercise price established by Company
Compensation Committee on December 4, 1996 grant date was $0428 per share.
The Company received $285,000 in payment for the 666,666 shares on December 4,
1996. The Plan calls for certain performance levels to be attained or the
passage of a specified period of time before the shares of Class A Common Stock
vest. In September 1997, in connection with the Offering, all shares of Class A
Common Stock were converted to Common Stock.
The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS 123. As permitted by the
statement, the Company has elected to continue to account for stock-based
compensation using the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for stock options granted at or above market value.
Had the fair value method of accounting been applied to the Company stock
option grants, which requires recognition of compensation cost ratably over the
vesting period of the underlying equity instruments, net income would have been
reduced by approximately $32,000 during the year ending December 31, 1997. The
per share impact would have been immaterial. This pro forma impact only takes
into account options granted since January 1, 1995 and is likely to increase in
future years as additional options are granted and amortized ratably over the
vesting period. The average fair value of options granted during the year
ending December 31, 1997 was $438. The fair value was estimated using the
Black Scholes option pricing model based on the weighted average market price at
grant date of $1060, volatility of 38% and a risk free interest rate of 65%.
There were no options granted for any periods prior to December 31, 1996.
In August 1997, the Company 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan was established. The Purchase Plan allows for up to 225,000
shares of Common stock to be issued at 85% of fair market value. As of December
31, 1997, no shares were issued under the Purchase Plan.
15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   The Company entered into a consulting agreement on December 23, 1991 with a
stockholder of the Company. The agreement provided, among other things, for the
payment of monthly consulting fees through December 31, 2001. The total
consulting fees charged to operations during the years ended December 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995 approximated $0, $516,000 and $360,000, respectively. The
consulting agreement was 
36
terminated pursuant to the terms contained in the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement and the Company received and executed a general release from the
former stockholder in consideration for the payment made.
During the years ending December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Company
leased space from a stockholder of the Company. The aggregate rent expense
charged to operations for those periods approximated $24,000, $84,000 and
$82,000, respectively. 16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS   In March 1998, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Strategic Implications International, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation. The purchase price was $4,330,000 in cash and
approximately 137,000 shares of the Company common stock. In addition, the
Company may be required to pay certain contingent payments based on revenue
goals related to the calendar year subsequent to the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The excess of purchase price over net assets acquired is estimated to be
approximately $8,500,000 and will be amortized over twenty years.
In January 1998, the Company purchased certain assets from Decision Point,
Inc., an Illinois company. The purchase price was $800,000 in cash, subject to
adjustment upward or downward based on certain revenue and pre-tax earnings
goals related to the calendar year subsequent to the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The excess of purchase price over net assets acquired, estimated to be $800,000,
will be amortized over twenty years.

The information appearing under the captions Information Regarding
Directors and Executive Officers in the registrant definitive proxy
statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 28,
