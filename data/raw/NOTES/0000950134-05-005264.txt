38 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Packeteer, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that
Packeteer, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Management of
Packeteer, Inc. is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Packeteer,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
Also, in our opinion, Packeteer, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, and
our report dated March 16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.   
/s/ KPMG LLP Mountain View, California March 16, 2005 39 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Packeteer, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004
and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Standard Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Packeteer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2004, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Packeteer, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March16, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Packeteer, Inc., along with its subsidiaries collectively
referred to herein as the Company,
Packeteer, we and us
provides WAN Application Traffic Management systems designed to
deliver a broad set of visibility, control, compression and
protocol acceleration capabilities to enterprise customers and
service providers. For enterprise customers, Packeteer systems
are designed to enable IT organizations to effectively optimize
application and network resources, while providing measurable
cost savings in wide area network, or WAN, investments. For
service providers, Packeteer systems are designed to provide a
platform for delivering application-intelligent network services
that control quality of service, or QoS, expand revenue
opportunities and offer compelling differentiation from other
potential solutions. The Company was incorporated on
January25, 1996, and commenced principal operations in
1997, at which time the Company began selling its products and
related services. The Company currently markets and distributes
its products via a worldwide network of resellers, distributors
and systems integrators.   
BASIS OF PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain previously reported amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.   
USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
related to inventory valuation, valuation of long-lived assets,
valuation allowances including sales return and rebate reserves
and allowance for doubtful accounts, and other liabilities,
specifically warranty reserves. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.   
REVENUE RECOGNITION Product revenues consist primarily of sales of our PacketShaper
products, which include hardware, as well as software licenses,
to distributors and resellers. Service revenues consist
primarily of maintenance revenue and, to a lesser extent,
training revenue. The Company applies the provisions of Statement of Position, or
SOP,97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as
amended by SOP98-9, Modification of SOP97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain
Transactions, to all transactions involving the sale of
hardware and software products. Revenue is generally recognized
when all of the following criteria are met, as set forth in
paragraph8 of SOP97-2   
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists     
delivery has occurred     
the fee is fixed or determinable,and     
collectibility is probable. 45 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Generally, product revenue is recognized upon shipment. However,
product revenue on sales to major new distributors are recorded
based on sell-through to the end user customers until such time
as the Company has established significant experience with the
distributors product exchange activity. Additionally, when
the Company introduces new product into its distribution channel
for which there is no historical customer demand or acceptance
history, revenue is recognized on the basis of sell-through to
end user customers until such time as demand or acceptance
history has been established. The Company has analyzed all of the elements included in its
multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has
sufficient vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair
value to allocate revenue to the maintenance component of its
product and to training. VSOE is based upon separate sales of
maintenance renewals and training to customers. Accordingly,
assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met, revenue
from product sales is recognized upon delivery using the
residual method in accordance with SOP98-9. Revenue from
maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term and
revenue from training is recognized when the training has taken
place.   
SALES RETURN RESERVES Management makes estimates of potential future product returns
related to current period product revenue in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS48,
Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists.
These sales return reserves are recorded as a reduction to
revenue. The Companys estimate for sales returns is based
on its historical return rates. The following provides additional details on the sales return
reserves in thousands

REBATE RESERVES Certain distributors and resellers can earn rebates under
several Packeteer programs. The rebates earned are recorded as a
reduction to revenues in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force EITF01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given
by a Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendors
Products. For established programs, the Companys
estimates for rebates are based on historical usage rates. For
new programs, rebate reserves are calculated to cover the
Companys maximum exposure until such time as historical
usage rates are developed. When sufficient historical experience
is established, there may be a reversal of previously accrued
rebates if actual rebate claims are less than the maximum
exposure. Additionally, there may be a reversal of previously
accrued rebate reserves if rebates are not claimed before the
expiration dates established for each program. Rebate reserves
at December31, 2004 and 2003 were $18million and
$877,000, respectively.   
ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS The allowance for doubtful accounts reduces trade receivables to
their net realizable value. When evaluating the adequacy of the
allowance for doubtful accounts, management reviews the aged
receivables on an account-by-account basis, taking into
consideration such factors as the age of the receivables,
customer history and estimated continued credit-worthiness, as
well as general economic and industry trends. 46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

COST OF REVENUES Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs of product,
overhead and maintenance support costs. The Company provides
currently for the estimated costs that may be incurred under
product warranties when products are shipped.   
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a
maturity of three months or less from date of purchase to be
cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of
cash on deposit with banks, money market instruments and
investments in commercial paper that are stated at cost which
approximates fair market value.   
INVESTMENTS Management determines the appropriate classification of
investment securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates
such designation as of each balance sheet date. As of
December31, 2004 and 2003, all investment securities are
designated as available-for-sale. These
available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value based on
quoted market prices, with the unrealized gains losses
reported as a separate component of stockholders equity.
The Company periodically reviews the realizable value of its
investments in marketable securities. When assessing marketable
securities for other-than temporary declines in value, we
consider such factors as the length of time and extent to which
fair value has been less than the cost basis, the market outlook
in general and the Companys intent and ability to hold the
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in market value. If an
other-thantemporary impairment of the investments is
deemed to exist, the carrying value of the investment would be
written down to its estimated fair value.   
INVENTORIES Inventories consist primarily of finished goods and are stated
at the lower of cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market.
We record inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories
based on historical usage and forecasted demand. If future
demand or market conditions are less favorable than our
projections, additional inventory write-downs may be required
and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the
revision is made. Inventories consisted of the following at December31 in

LONG-LIVED ASSETS Property and equipment, including equipment acquired
under capital lease, are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are provided using a straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally 18months
to four years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
shorter of estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease
term, generally five years. During 2004, the remaining leases
were fully paid and the equipment under capital lease was
transferred to computers and equipment. Property and equipment consisted of the following at

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the
estimated fair value of net assets acquired as of the
acquisition date. The Company has adopted the requirements of
SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
effective January1, 2002. SFAS142 requires goodwill
to be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between
annual tests when indicators of impairment exist, and written
down when impaired. Goodwill of $95million was recorded
in connection with the acquisition of Mentat, Inc., or Mentat,
in December 2004. Other intangibles include purchased intangibles recorded
in connection with the acquisition of Mentat. The following

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of any asset to future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell.   
ADVERTISING AND SALES PROMOTION COSTS Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred
and the amounts were not material for all periods presented.   
WARRANTY RESERVES Upon shipment of products to its customers, the Company provides
for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be
returned under warranty. The Companys warranty period is
typically 12months from the date of shipment to the end
user customer. For existing products, the reserve is estimated
based on actual historical experience. For new products, the
required reserve is based on historical experience of similar
products until such time as sufficient historical data has been
collected on the new product. The following provides a reconciliation of changes in
Packeteers warranty reserve in thousands

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Development costs incurred in the research and development of
new products, other than software, and enhancements to existing
products are expensed as incurred. Costs for the development of
new software products and enhancements to existing products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been
established, at which time any additional development costs
would be capitalized in accordance with SFAS86,
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software To Be Sold,
Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. To 49 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued date, the Companys software has been available for general
release shortly after the establishment of technological
feasibility, which the Company defines as a working prototype,
and accordingly, capitalizable costs have not been material.   
CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. The
Companys cash, cash equivalents and investments are
maintained with highly accredited financial institutions and
investments are placed with high quality issuers. The Company
believes no significant concentration of credit risk exists with
respect to these financial instruments. Credit risk with respect
to trade receivables are limited as the Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers. Based on managements
evaluation of potential credit losses, the Company believes its
allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate. A limited number of indirect channel partners have accounted for
a large part of our revenues to date and we expect that this
trend will continue. In 2004, sales to Alternative Technology,
Inc. and Westcon, Inc. accounted for 22%, and 19% of net
revenues, respectively. In 2003, sales to Alternative
Technology, Inc., Westcon, Inc. and Macnica, Inc. accounted for
22%, 14% and 10% of net revenues, respectively. In 2002, sales
to the same three customers accounted for 21%, 13% and 11% of
net revenues, respectively. At December31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, three customers accounted for 41%, 42% and 38% of accounts
receivable, respectively. During 2004, we contracted with SMTC for all of our
manufacturing requirements. In January 2005, we signed
agreements with Plexus Services, Corp., an additional contract
manufacturer, to manufacture our products and provide
fulfillment services. Our reliance on third-party manufacturers
for all our manufacturing requirements could cause us to lose
orders if these third-party manufacturers fail to satisfy our
cost, quality and delivery requirements.   
INCOME TAXES The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of
deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation
allowance for any tax benefits of which future realization is
uncertain.   
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company adopted SFAS148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, which amended SFAS123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, in December 2002. As
permitted under SFAS123 and 148, Packeteer has elected to
continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB25 in accounting for its stock-based employee
compensation arrangements. During 2004, stock-based compensation
of $14,000 related to the issuance of restricted shares in
connection with the Mentat acquisition, was included in
compensation expense. The following table illustrates the effect

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS The Companys sales to international customers are
U.S.dollar-denominated. As a result, there are no foreign
currency gains or losses related to these transactions. 51 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The functional currency for the Companys foreign
subsidiaries is the U.S.dollar. Accordingly, the entities
remeasure monetary assets and liabilities at period-end exchange
rates, while non-monetary items are remeasured at historical
rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average
rates in effect during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are
recognized in income as transaction gains or losses in the year
of occurrence. To date, the effect of such amounts on net income
has not been significant.   
OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME LOSS The Company reports comprehensive income or loss in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. SFAS130 establishes standards
for reporting comprehensive income and loss and its components
in financial statements. For the Company, the primary
differences between reported net income loss and comprehensive
income loss are unrealized gains or losses on securities
available for sale. Tax effects of the components of other
comprehensive income loss are not considered material for any
periods presented.   
NET INCOME PER SHARE Basic net income per share has been computed using the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period, less the weighted-average number of common shares that
are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share has been
computed using the weighted average number of common and
potential common shares outstanding during the period. All
warrants for common stock and outstanding stock options have
been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share
for periods where their inclusion would be antidilutive. The following table presents the calculation of basic and

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In November 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on certain
portions of EITF03-01, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments. EITF03-01 provides new disclosure
requirements for other-than-temporary impairments on debt and
equity investments. Investors are required to disclose
quantitative information about: ithe aggregate amount of
unrealized losses, and iithe aggregate related fair
values of investments with unrealized losses, segregated into
time periods during which the investment has been in an
unrealized loss position of less than 12months and greater
than 12months. In addition, investors are required to
disclose the qualitative information that supports their
conclusion that the impairments noted in the qualitative
disclosure are not other-than temporary. The Company adopted the
initial disclosure requirements of EITF03-01 in December
2003. The adoption of the remaining portions of EITF03-01
has been postponed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB pending issuance of additional implementation guidance
regarding the impairment of certain debt securities. In November 2004, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue
No03-13, Applying the Conditions in
Paragraph42 of FASB Statement144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, in
Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. The
consensus provides guidance in determining: awhich cash
flows should be taken into consideration when assessing whether
the cash flows of the disposal component have been or will be
eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity,
bthe types of involvement ongoing between the disposal
component and the entity disposing of the component that
constitute continuing involvement in the operations of the
disposal component, and cthe appropriate
reassessment period for purposes of assessing whether
the criteria in paragraph42 have been met. The consensus
was ratified by the FASB at their November30, 2004 meeting
and should be applied to a component of an enterprise that is
either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal
periods beginning after December15, 2004. The Company does
not anticipate a material impact on the financial statements
from the adoption of this consensus. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS123R, Share
Based Payment. SFAS123R, which will be effective
in the third quarter of 2005. SFAS123R will result in
the recognition of substantial compensation expense relating to
our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The
Company currently uses the intrinsic value method to measure
compensation expense for stock-based awards to its employees.
Under this standard, the Company generally does not recognize
any compensation related to stock option grants the Company
issues under its stock option plan or related to the discounts
the Company provides under its employee stock purchase plan.
Under the new rules, the Company is required to adopt a
fair-value-based method for measuring the compensation expense
related to employee stock awards. This will lead to substantial
additional compensation expense. The paragraph entitled
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION included in note1 to these
consolidated financial statements provides the pro forma net
income and earnings per share as if the Company had used a
fair-value-based method similar to the methods required under
SFAS123R to measure the compensation expense for
employee stock awards during 2004, 2003 and 2002. 53 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets An Amendment
of APB Opinion No29. The amendments made by
Statement153 are based on the principle that exchanges of
nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of
the assets exchanged. Further, the amendments eliminate the
narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of
nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. The provisions in Statement153 are
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal
periods beginning after June15, 2005. Adoption of this
standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.

ACQUISITION OF MENTAT, INC. On December21, 2004, Packeteer acquired all of the
outstanding common stock of Mentat, a privately held company
located in Los Angeles, California. Mentat is a technology
leader in protocol acceleration technologies and transparent
proxies, providing high performance networking solutions for
satellite and high-latency networks. The acquisition deepens and
extends Packeteers intellectual property and provides
advanced acceleration capabilities for new WAN performance
solutions for global customers. The aggregate purchase price of Mentat was approximately
$191million, including acquisition costs. Of the
$191million, $173million was paid in cash upon
closing and the remaining $18million was paid to the
former shareholders of Mentat upon the collection of a non-trade
receivable. The non-trade receivable was collected in January
2005 and was immediately paid to the former shareholders of
Mentat per the terms of the purchase agreement. Our methodology
for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase
acquisitions is determined through established valuation
techniques in the high-technology networking industry. Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the
sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed. The
following table presents the allocation of the acquisition cost,
including professional fees and other related acquisition costs,
to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their
fair values in thousands

These intangible assets have useful lives ranging from three to
six years. Both the purchased intangible assets and the goodwill
are expected to be deductible for tax purposes. In addition, Packeteer will pay up to $37million in
retention bonuses to former Mentat employees including both cash
and restricted stock to incent Mentat employees to remain with
Packeteer. The cash bonuses, totaling approximately
$20million will be paid to the Mentat employees in equal
installments, one 54 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued half one year from the date of acquisition and the remainder on
the two year anniversary of the acquisition, so long as the
employee remains employed with Packeteer on each of the
installment dates. The restricted stock retention bonuses
totaling approximately 114,000 restricted shares were valued at
$17million, however approximately 4,000shares
valued at $59,000 were repurchased on the date of acquisition
due to employee terminations. The value of the shares was
determined based on the fair value of the Companys stock
at the date of issuance. The shares vest in equal installments,
one third one year from the date of acquisition, one third on
the second anniversary of the acquisition and one third on the
third anniversary of the acquisition, so long as the employee
remains employed with Packeteer on each of the anniversary
dates. The Company recognized deferred stock-based compensation
of approximately $16million associated with these
restricted shares. This amount is included as a component of
stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to
operations over the vesting period of the restricted shares in
accordance with the method described in FIN28.
Amortization of stock-based compensation associated with these
shares totaled $14,000 for the year ended December31, 2004. Mentats results of operations have been included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition,
December21, 2004. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented, as the results were not material for all periods
presented. 55 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At December31, 2004, the Company did not have any
investments in individual securities that have been in a
continuous unrealized loss position for more than 12months. The Company invests in investment grade securities. The
individual securities included in the table above have been in a
continuous loss position for periods of nine months or less. The
unrealized losses on these investments were caused by interest
rate increases and not credit quality. At this time, we believe
that, due to the nature of the investments, the short time
period that these unrealized loss positions have existed, and
Packeteers ability and intent to hold the investments
through these short-term loss positions, factors would not
indicate that these unrealized losses should be viewed as
other-than-temporary.

NOTE PAYABLE In August 2001, the Company secured a $551,000 equipment loan.
Borrowings under this agreement were collateralized by the

were repayable in monthly installments over a three-year period.
At December31, 2004, this note had been repaid in full.

CONTINGENCIES In November 2001, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York against the Company, certain officers and directors of
the Company, and the underwriters of the Companys initial
public offering. An amended complaint, captioned In re
Packeteer, Inc. Initial Public Offering Securities
Litigation, 01-CV-10185 SAS, was filed on April20,
2002. The amended complaint alleges violations of the federal
securities laws on behalf of a purported class of those who
acquired the Companys common stock between the date of the
Companys initial public offering, or IPO, and
December6, 2000. The amended complaint alleges that the
description in the prospectus for the Companys IPO was
materially false and misleading in describing the compensation
to be earned by the underwriters of the Companys IPO, and
in not describing certain alleged arrangements among
underwriters and initial purchasers of the Companys common
stock. The amended complaint seeks damages and certification of
a plaintiff class consisting of all persons who acquired shares
of the Companys common stock between July27, 1999
and December6, 2000. A special committee of the board of directors has authorized the
Company to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding
negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and
their insurers. Any such settlement would be subject to approval
by the Court. If the settlement is not approved, we intend to
vigorously defend ourselves against plaintiffs
allegations. We do not currently believe that the outcome of
this proceeding will have a material adverse impact on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. No
amount has been accrued as of December31, 2004, as
management believes a loss is not probable or estimable. The Company is routinely involved in legal and administrative
proceedings incidental to its normal business activities and
believes that these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Net current deferred tax assets of $540,000 at December31,
2004 are included in prepaids and other current assets. Net
long-term deferred tax assets of $18million at
December31, 2004 are included in other non-current assets.
A valuation allowance has been provided to reduce the deferred
tax an asset to an amount management believes is more likely
than not to be realized. Expected realization of deferred tax
assets for which a valuation allowance has not been recognized
is based upon the reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and taxable income expected to be generated in the
future. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the
year ended December31, 2004 was a decrease of
$58million, of which $24million related to release
of valuation allowance and $37million related to
operating losses utilized. The net change in the valuation
allowance for the year ended December31, 2003 was a
decrease of $441,000. Approximately $154million of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets is attributable to employee stock option
deductions, the benefit from which will be allocated to
additional paid-in capital when, and if, it is subsequently
realized. Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is
managements intention to indefinitely reinvest such
undistributed earnings outside the U.S. At December31, 2004 the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards for federal and California income tax purposes of
approximately $350million and $140million,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2011, and the California
net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2006.
At December31, 2004, the Company had federal and California 59 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued research credit carryforwards of approximately $23million
and $22million, respectively. If not utilized, the
federal research credit carryforwards will begin to expire in
2011. The California research credit carryforwards can be
carried forward indefinitely. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act,
enacted on October22, 2004, provides for a temporary 85%
dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings during
either fiscal 2004 or fiscal 2005. The Company did not elect
this provision in fiscal 2004, therefore, the period during
which the qualifying distributions can be made is fiscal 2005.
The deduction would result in an approximate 525% federal tax
rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction,
the earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to
a domestic reinvestment plan established by the Companys
chief executive officer and approved by the Companys board
of directors. Certain other criteria in the Act must be
satisfied as well. The Company is not yet in a position to
decide on whether, and to what extent, it might repatriate
foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the United
States. Income taxes paid were $475,000, $648,000 and $89,000 for 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY   
PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK The Companys Board of Directors has authorized
5,000,000shares of preferred stock. The authorized
preferred stock shares are undesignated and the Board has the
authority to issue and to determine the rights, preference and
privileges thereof. The Companys Board of Directors has authorized
85,000,000shares of common stock.   
WARRANTS As of December31, 2004, 45,000 warrants to purchase common
stock were outstanding and exercisable with a $625 exercise
price per share and an expiration date in May 2009.   
1999 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors adopted the
1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. The ESPP became
effective July27, 1999. At that time, 500,000shares
were reserved for issuance under this plan. The number of shares
reserved under this ESPP automatically increases annually
beginning on January1, 2000 by the lesser of one million
shares or 2% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding. The ESPP permits participants to purchase common
stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of an
employees compensation, including commissions, overtime,
bonuses and other incentive compensation. The purchase price per
share is equal to 85% of the fair market value per share on the
participants entry date into the offering period or, if
lower, 85% of the fair market value per share on the semi-annual
purchase date. As of December31, 2004, 984,000shares
had been issued under the plan and 25million were
available for future issuance. The fair value of the discount
and look-back features are considered compensation for purposes
of computing the Companys proforma earnings for stock
based compensation.   
1999 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN The 1999 Stock Incentive Plan 1999 Plan is intended to serve
as the successor program to our 1996 Equity Incentive Plan 1996
Plan. In May 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
approved the 1999 Plan, which became effective on July27,
1999, under which 900,000shares were reserved for
issuance. Previously, 515,000shares were authorized under
the 1996 Plan. In addition, any shares not issued under the 1996
Plan will also be available for grant under the 1999 Plan. The
number of shares reserved under the 1999 Plan automatically
increases annually beginning on January1, 2000 by the
lesser of three million shares or 5% of the total number of
shares of common stock outstanding. Under the 1999 Plan,
eligible individuals may be granted options to purchase common
shares or may be issued shares of common stock directly. The
1999 Plan 60 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, which sets the terms and conditions of the options.
Non-statutory stock options and incentive stock options are
exercisable at prices not less than 85% and 100%, respectively,
of the fair value on the date of grant. The options become 25%
vested one year after the date of grant with 1/48per month
vesting thereafter and expire at the end of 10years from
date of grant or sooner if terminated by the Board of Directors.
The options may include a provision whereby the option holder
may elect at any time to exercise the option prior to the full
vesting of the option. Unvested shares so purchased shall be
subject to a repurchase right by the Company at the original
purchase price. Such right shall lapse at a rate equivalent to
the vesting period of the original option. As of
December31, 2003, there were no outstanding shares subject
to repurchase. As of December31, 2004, options for
186million shares had been issued and 22million
were available for future grant. In October 2001, the Company announced a voluntary stock option
exchange program, or Offer to Exchange, for all
employees except executive officers. Under the program, these
employees had the opportunity to cancel certain outstanding
options previously granted to them that had an exercise price at
or above $500 in exchange for an equal number of new options to
be granted at a future date. The Offer to Exchange was
outstanding until 5:00p.m., Pacific Daylight Time on
November30, 2001 the Expiration Date. The
exercise price of the new options was to be equal to the fair
market value of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant, which was June3, 2002. Participants electing to
exchange any options were also required to exchange all options
granted to him or her during the sixmonths before the date
of the Offer to Exchange and were precluded from receiving any
options during the sixmonths after the Expiration Date.
Options totaling 15million shares were canceled under
this program in November 2001. Options totaling 14million
were reissued on June3, 2002 at an option price of
$610per share, which was the fair market value on the
date of grant. A summary of stock option activity under 1999 Plan follows in

In the year ended December31, 2003, 51,250shares
were issued as a result of the exercise of non-plan options
granted before the July28, 1999 initial public offering.
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, there were 9,333 non-plan
options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of
$025per share.   
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In connection with the acquisition of Mentat in December 2004,
the Company issued approximately 114,000 restricted shares
valued at $17million, however approximately
4,000shares valued at $59,000 were repurchased on the date
of acquisition due to employee terminations. The value of the
shares was determined based on the fair value of the
Companys stock at the date of issuance. The shares vest in
equal installments, one-third one year from the date of
acquisition, one-third on the second anniversary of the
acquisition and one-third on the third anniversary of the
acquisition, so long as the employee is still employed by
Packeteer on the anniversary date. The Company recorded deferred
stock-based compensation of approximately $16million
associated with these restricted shares. This amount is included
as a component of stockholders equity and is being
amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of
the restricted shares in accordance with the method described in
FIN28. Amortization of stock-based compensation associated
with these shares totaled $14,000 for the year ended
December31, 2004. In connection with options granted in 1999 and 1998, the Company
recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $39million
and $787,000, respectively, representing the difference between
the exercise price and the fair value of the Companys
common stock at the date of grant. In 2000, the Company recorded
deferred stock-based compensation of $11million related
to employee options assumed in the Workfire acquisition. The
amounts were being amortized over the vesting period for the
individual options, generally four years. Amortization of
stock-based compensation of $19,000 and $385,000 was recognized
during the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. 62 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

401k PLAN In 1997, the Company adopted a 401k plan 401k.
Participation in the 401k is available to all employees. Entry
date to the 401k is the first day of each month. Each
participant may elect to contribute an amount up to 100% of his
or her annual base salary plus commission and bonus, but not to
exceed the statutory limit as prescribed by the Internal Revenue

SEGMENT REPORTING The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information. The Companys chief operating decision
maker is considered to be the Companys CEO. The CEO
reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis
substantially similar to the consolidated financial statements.
Therefore, the Company has concluded that it operates in one
segment and accordingly has provided only the required
enterprise-wide disclosures. The Company operates in the United States and internationally,
and derives its revenue from the sale of products and software
licenses and maintenance contracts related to the Companys
products. Sales outside of the Americas accounted for 59%, 55%
and 56% of net revenues in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Geographic information is as follows in thousands

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our
principal executive officer and our principal financial officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
sufficiently effective to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form10-K
was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and instructions for
Form10-K. There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2004 that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f. Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2004. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls
and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Packeteer have
been detected. Notwithstanding these limitations, our disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance of achieving their objectives. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at
the reasonable assurance level. 64 Table of Contents
