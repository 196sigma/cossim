REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of Directors and Stockholders, Docent, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Docent, Inc. as of
December 31, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a

statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Docent, Inc. at December 31, 2001, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  /s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.Organization and Basis of Presentation  The Company is a provider of products and services that enable the exchange of knowledge within and among large enterprises and content providers. The Companys Internet-based platform provides for the delivery
of learning content online, commonly known as eLearning, and brings together the Companys customers into a virtual marketplace with an array of value-added features, commonly known as a knowledge exchange.  2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible assets and restructuring. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid financial instruments consisting primarily of investments in money market funds and commercial paper, with insignificant interest
rate risk and with original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition.  Investments
Short-term and long-term investments are stated at amounts that approximate fair value based on quoted market prices. In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, management determines the appropriate classification of the debt securities at the
time of purchase and re-evaluates the designation as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company classified all of the debt securities as available-for-sale pursuant to SFAS No. 115. Short-term investments consist
principally of taxable, short-term money market instruments with maturities between 90 days and one year. Long-term investments have maturity greater than one year at the time of purchase.

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Proceeds from sales and maturities of securities available-for-sale were $43,212,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001. For the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, there were no proceeds from the sale and maturities of available-for-sale
securities. Gross realized gains and losses were insignificant for all periods presented.  Restricted Cash 
At December 31, 2001, the Company had $456,000 of restricted cash for a lease deposit on the Companys Sunnyvale California facility.
Fair value of financial instruments  Carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amounts of notes payable and capital lease obligations approximate fair value based on the terms of similar borrowing arrangements available to the Company. 
Risks and uncertainties  The Company is subject to all of the risks inherent in a company that operates in the intensely competitive Internet industry, providing a service which is relatively new and constantly evolving. These risks include,
but are not limited to, dependence upon customer acceptance of the Internet, development of relationships with content providers, reliance on third-party software incorporated in the Companys products and market acceptance of the
Companys products and services. The Companys operating results may be materially affected by the foregoing factors.  Concentration of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of
credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are deposited with three financial institutions which, at times, may exceed federally insured
limits. 
43  
DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers in a wide variety of
industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, does not require collateral and maintains allowances for potential credit losses when deemed necessary. To date, such losses
have been within managements expectations. At December 31, 2001, the Company had accounts receivable from one customer representing 14% of total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2000, the Company had accounts receivable from one customer
representing 10% of total accounts receivable.  Revenue recognition 
The Company derives its revenue from the licensing of its software, either through perpetual or time-based licenses, maintenance and support, hosting and the provision of
professional services, including implementation, consulting and training.  In accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, as amended, the Company recognize revenue from licensing its software if all of the following conditions are met:  There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  The Company have delivered the product to the customer;  Collection of the fees is probable; and  The amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.  For arrangements requiring customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received
from the customer. The Company considers all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable. The Companys normal payment terms currently range from net 30 days to net 60 days. For
arrangements involving extended payment terms, revenue recognition occurs when payments are due.  For arrangements involving
time-based licenses, customers pay a fee based on the number of users, and such fees include maintenance and support. Objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the related maintenance and support as maintenance and support is not offered
separately for such time-based arrangements. In these cases, the Company recognizes the entire arrangement fee ratably over the contractual maintenance and support period, which is generally one year. The Company has allocated the time-based license
and maintenance revenue based on their relative costs.  For arrangements involving a significant amount of services related to
installation, modification or customization of our software product, the Company recognize revenue using the percentage-of-completion method. However, where there are customer acceptance clauses, which the Company does not have an established
history of meeting or which are not considered to be routine, the Company recognizes revenue when the arrangement has been completed and accepted by the customer.  For arrangements which include multiple elements, such as a product license, maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, the Company allocates revenue to all undelivered
elements, usually maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, based on objective evidence of the fair value of those elements. Fair value is specific to the Company and represents the price for which the Company sells each element
separately. Any amount remaining is allocated using the residual method to the delivered elements,
44  
DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
generally only the product license, and recognized as revenue when the conditions discussed above are satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue from fees for ongoing maintenance and support
ratably over the period of the maintenance and support agreement, which is generally one year. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to, or fees generated from, the separate selling of professional services as the related services are performed.
Fees associated with hosting and ASP services, are recognized ratably over the period of the hosting agreement, which is generally one year.  The Company recognizes revenues from fees for ongoing maintenance and support ratably over the period of the maintenance and support agreement, which is generally one year. The Company recognizes revenue allocated to,
or fees generated from, the separate selling of professional services as the related services are performed.  For arrangements
with content providers, the minimum fee is allocated among the separate elements, including professional services and hosting, based on the fair value of each of these elements. Any minimum royalty amount is recognized as revenue ratably over the
period in which it is earned, which is generally one year. Any royalty over and above the minimum is recognized upon receipt of a revenue report from the content provider.  Revenue from sales to resellers is recognized upon the receipt of a purchase order or a sales contract from the reseller and when the end customer had been identified, provided all the
conditions for revenue recognition set forth above have been met. No right of return exists for these sales.  Customer billings
that have not been recognized as revenue in accordance with the above policies are shown on the balance sheet as deferred revenue.  Property and equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are generally
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease, or the useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated
depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations for the period realized.

Long-lived assets 
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including goodwill, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, which requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the
future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated
cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Losses on long-lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal. The Company had no indicators of
impairment on gForce during 2001 and therefore no losses from impairment have been recognized in the financial statements.  Website Development costs  The Company accounts for Website development costs in accordance with the FASB
Emerging Issues Task Force 00-2 EITF, Accounting for Website Development Costs. EITF 00-2 requires all costs related to the development of websites other than those incurred during the application development stage to be expensed as
incurred. Costs incurred during the application development state are required to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has capitalized website development costs and
recorded them under Other Assets.  Capitalized Software  Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal use, which are required to be capitalized pursuant to Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1,
Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, are included in property, plant and equipment.  Research and development  Costs incurred in the research and development of new software
products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established. Development costs are capitalized beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general
release to customers. Technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage. To date, software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant, and all software
development costs have been charged to research and development expenses.

Advertising  Costs related to advertising and promotion of products is charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
were $324,000, $19 million, and $84,000, respectively.  Income taxes  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.  Stock-based compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the estimated fair value of the Companys common stock and the exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value
based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment. The pro forma disclosures of the difference between the compensation expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method are
presented in Note 10. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued
to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services.  Accumulated Other

Net loss per share 
Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less
outstanding unvested shares. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common shares as the effect is antidilutive, due to the Company net loss in each period. Potential common shares are comprised of common stock subject to
repurchase rights, incremental shares of common and preferred stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of convertible preferred stock.

No customers accounted for more than 10% of the Companys revenue for the
year ended December 31, 2001 and the year ended December 31, 2000. One customer accounted for 27% of the Companys revenue for the year ended December 31, 1999.  Recently issued accounting pronouncements  In July 2001,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The new rules require business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting and goodwill acquired after this date will no longer be amortized, but will be subject to annual impairment tests. Application of non-amortization provisions of Statement 142 is not expected to result in change to
results of operations in 2002, as there was no goodwill being amortized in 2001. All other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company will test goodwill generated by the gForce acquisition for
impairment using the two-step process prescribed in SFAS No. 142. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of impairment, if any. The Company expects to perform the first of the required
impairment tests of goodwill as of January 1, 2002 in the first half of 2002. Any impairment change resulting from these transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first half
of 2002. The Company has not determined what effect of these tests will be on its financial position or operating results.  In
August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations for a disposal of a segment of a business. FAS 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with earlier

application encouraged. The Company adopted FAS 144 as of January 1, 2002 and it does not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on the Companys financial
position and results of operations.  In November 2001, the FASB issued a Staff Announcement The Announcement,
Topic D-103, which concluded that the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses should be classified as revenue in the statement of operations. This Announcement should be applied in financial reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2001. Upon application of this Announcement, comparative financial statements for prior periods should be reclassified to comply with the guidance in this Announcement. The Company currently records reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses in cost of services. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company will apply this Announcement.  3.Balance Sheet Components

The Company acquired gForce by assuming liabilities of $4,743,000 and providing
an advance payment of $119,000. The Company also incurred approximately $420,000 of acquisition costs. To settle certain gForce liabilities, the Company issued 499,999 shares of our common stock valued at an aggregate amount of $1,019,000. To cover
any undisclosed pre-acquisition claims against gForce, of the total shares of 499,999, the Company placed 125,000 shares of Docents common stock in escrow for 18 months.  To determine the value of the developed technology, the expected future cash flow attributed to all existing technology was discounted, taking into account risks related to the
characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of technology, existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of technology. The $707,000 assigned to
research and development assets represented acquired in-process research and development IPRD that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The Company wrote off these assets at the date of
acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 to Business Combination Accounted for by the Purchase Method. To estimate the value of the IPRD, the
expected cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the IPRD were calculated. These cash flows considered the contribution of the core technology, the risks related to the development of the IPRD and the percent complete as of the
valuation date as well as the expected life cycle of the technology. Finally, the cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the IPRD, net of the core technology contribution, were discounted to the present value to estimate the value of
the IPRD. Goodwill is determined based on the residual difference between the amount paid and the values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets. The Company began amortizing developed technology, core technology, trademarks and
patents over useful life of fourteen to thirty six months. Goodwill is not being amortized.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had federal and state net operating loss
carry-forwards of approximately $93,340,000 and $41,420,000 million respectively, available to offset future taxable income. The Companys federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire in the years 2004 through 2021, if not
utilized.  At December 31, 2001, the Company also has federal and state research and development credit carry-forwards of
approximately $740,000 and $520,000, respectively. The federal carry-forwards will expire in the years 2018 through 2021, if not fully utilized.  Utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions.
The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.  Deferred income
taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Companys deferred
tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands:

Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, the
timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, a valuation allowance, in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2001 has been established to reflect these uncertainties. The valuation allowance increased by
$16,688,000, $15,478,000 and $5,830,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Approximately
$220,000 of the valuation allowance is attributable to stock options, the benefit of which will be credited to paid-in capital when realized.
