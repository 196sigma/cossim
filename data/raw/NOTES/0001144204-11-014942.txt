Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Note 1.Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business TranSwitch Corporation was incorporated in Delaware on April 26, 1988 and is headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut. TranSwitch Corporation and its subsidiaries collectively, TranSwitch or the Company designs, develops and supplies innovative semiconductor and intellectual property IP solutions that provide core functionality for voice, data and video communications equipment for network, enterprise and customer premises applications. The Company provides integrated multi-core network processor System-on-a-Chip SoC solutions and software solutions for Fixed, 3G and 4G Mobile, VoIP and Multimedia Infrastructures.For the customer premises market the Company offers a family of communications processors that provide best-in-class performance for a range of
applications andalso provide interoperable connectivity solutions that enable the reliable distribution and presentation of high-definition HD content for consumer electronics, and personal computermarkets.Our intellectual property IP products are compliant with global industry standards such as HDMI and DisplayPort and also feature our proprietary HDP and AnyCable technologies. Overall, the Company has over 100 active customers, including the leading global telecom equipment providers, semiconductor and consumer product companies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TranSwitch Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates relate to uncollectable accounts receivable, excess or slow-moving or obsolete inventories, impairment of assets, product warranty allowances, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, sales returns and allowances, stock rotation allowances and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of
revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Liquidity The Company has incurred significant operating losses and used cash in its operating activities for the past several years. Operating losses have resulted from inadequate sales levels for the cost structure. The Company reduced operating expenses during 2010 as a result of the restructuring plans it implemented during 2009 and 2010. The Company also announced further restructuring actions to be implemented during 2011 see Note 21. The Company believes that with the current anticipated gross profit margins and operating expenses the Company can break-even on an operating income basis, excluding stock compensation costs and amortization of purchased intangibles, at the rate of sales of $118 million per quarter. Also, the Company intends to continue to
assess its cost structure in relationship to its revenue levels and to make appropriate adjustments to expense levels as required. Nonetheless, the Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents and a bank financing facility, which expired on March 12, 2011 and is currently under discussions to renew, will be sufficient to fund operating activities and capital expenditures, and provide adequate working capital through at least the next twelve months.Of course, there can be no assurance that the anticipated sales level will be achieved or that the Company will successfully renew its bank financing facility. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.The majority of the Companys cash and cash equivalents balances are maintained with a limited number of major financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents balances at institutions may, at times, be above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit of $025million per account.  47 TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Short-term investments as of December 31, 2010 consist of government bonds which are all due within one year. Such investments are classified as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has both the ability and intent to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost. Amortized cost and accrued interest as of December 31, 2010 approximate market value. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. Based on current market conditions, the fair value of the outstanding 545% Convertible Notes due 2011 was estimated at approximately $38 million and $88 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The fair value of investments in non-publicly traded companies is not readily determinable. Accounts Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that it believes to be uncollectible along with the Companys assessment of the general financial condition of its customer base. If the Companys actual collections experience changes, revisions to its allowances may be required. The Company has a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date. Any unanticipated change in one of those customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectability of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost determined on a weighted-average cost basis or estimated net realizable value. The Company provides inventory allowances on obsolete inventories and inventories in excess of expected demand for each specific part. The valuation of inventories requires the use of estimates as to the amounts of current inventories that will be sold. These estimates are dependent on the Companys assessment of current and expected orders from its customers, and orders generally are subject to cancellation with limited advance notice prior to shipment. Product Licenses All product licenses were fully amortized as of December 31, 2008. Prior thereto product licenses were amortized using the greater of: 1 the amount computed using the ratio of a products current gross revenues to the products total of current and estimated future gross revenues; or 2 the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally three to five years, not to exceed the term of the license. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Any gain or loss resulting from sale or retirement is included in the consolidated statement of operations. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while renewals and betterments are capitalized. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the business acquired.The Company reviews goodwill for potential impairment at least annually. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets consist of purchased customer relationships and developed technology and are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Customer relationships and developed technology are being amortized by the straight line method over their estimated economic useful lives ranging from five to ten years.  48 TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs are being amortized using the interest method over the term of the related debt. Unamortized deferred financing fees were $01 million and $02 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amortization, included in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of interest expense, was $02 million, $02 million, and $06 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairment of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived and intangible assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that a long-lived asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, an estimate of the related assets undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the asset is made to measure whether the carrying value is recoverable. Any impairment is measured based upon the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value which is generally based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows. A significant amount of management judgment is used in estimating future discounted cash flows. The Companys impairment reviews of goodwill were performed using a fair-value method and discounted cash flow models with estimated cash flows based on internal forecasts which included terminal values based on current market valuation metrics.The fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms-length basis.In estimating fair value, the Company used its common stocks market price to determine fair value and other valuation metrics. In addition, the Company performed discounted cash flow analysis on the reporting units to determine fair value.During the fourth quarter of 2009, impairment testing performed by the Company indicated that the estimated fair values of two
reporting units tested were less than their corresponding carrying amounts. As a result of the analyses performed, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $101 million in 2009. The impaired goodwill related to business acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. There were no impairment charges in 2010 or 2008. Investments in Non-Publicly Traded Companies The Company has minority investments in certain non-publicly traded companies. Depending on the Companys level of ownership and whether or not the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, these investments are accounted for by either the cost or equity method. All such investments as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 are accounted for by the cost method.These investments are reviewed periodically for impairment. Revenue Recognition Net revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of product shipment when the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 ownership and risk of loss transfers to the customer; 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable; and 4 collectability is reasonably assured. Agreements with certain distributors provide price protection and return and allowance rights. With respect to recognizing revenues from distributors: 1 the prices are fixed at the date of shipment from the Companys facilities; 2 payment is not contractually or otherwise excused until the product is resold; 3 the Company does not have any obligations for future performance relating to the resale of the product; and 4 the amount of future returns, allowances, refunds and costs to be incurred can be reasonably estimated and are accrued at the time of shipment. At the time of shipment, the Company records a reduction to revenue with a related liability to accrue for future price protection. This liability is established based on historical experience, contractually agreed-to provisions and future shipment forecasts. Such accruals have been insignificant for the last three years. The Company also accrues, at the time of shipment, a reduction to revenue with a related liability and an inventory asset against product cost of revenues in order to establish a provision for the gross margin related to future returns under the Companys distributor stock rotation program. Such accruals related to reductions of revenue were $08 million, $06 million and less than $01 million at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.The accruals related to inventory assets are insignificant to the Companys financial position and results of operations for all periods presented.Should actual experience differ from estimated liabilities, there could be adjustments either favorable or unfavorable to the Companys net revenues, cost of revenues and gross
profits.  49 TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Service revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 services have been performed in accordance with the contractual obligations; 3 the fee is fixed or determinable; and 4 collectability is reasonably assured. The Company licenses connectivity solutions, including HDMI, DisplayPort and Ethernet IP Cores.Revenues from licensing arrangements generally consist of multiple elements such as license, implementation and maintenance services. The items deliverables included in the arrangement are evaluated to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. The Company performs this evaluation at the inception of an arrangement and as the Company delivers each item in the arrangement. Generally, the Company accounts for a deliverable or a group of deliverables separately if 1 the delivered items has standalone value to the customer, 2 there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items included in the arrangement, and 3 if the Company has given the customer a general right of return relative to the delivered items, delivery or performance of the undelivered items or services are probable and substantially in the Companys control. The Company recognizes revenue from royalties upon notification of sale by its licensees. The terms of the royalty agreements generally require licensees to give notification to the Company and to pay royalties within 45 days of the end of the quarter during which the sales by its licensees take place. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are held by high-quality financial institutions, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. In addition, the Company limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately 53% and 57% of accounts receivable were due from five customers. The majority of the Companys sales are to customers in the telecommunications and data communications industries. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. Customers that accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable at each period end follows  December31 2010 December31 2009  Customer A 16 Customer B 15 Customer C 15 Customer D 14 Customer E 11 Customer F 11 Accounts receivable due were less than 10% of the Companys total accounts receivable. Supplier Concentrations The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for wafer fabrication capacity. In 2010 one outside wafer foundry supplied approximately 80% of our semiconductor wafer requirements. Although the Company would likely be able to find alternative manufacturing sources, the Company would experience substantial delays or interruptions in the shipment of products if these suppliers were to cease operations.  50  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Operating Leases The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent and is included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets. Product Warranties The Company provides warranties on its products for up to one year from the date of shipment. A liability is recorded for estimated costs to be incurred under product warranties, which is based on various inputs including historical experience. Estimated warranty expense is recorded as cost of revenues as products are shipped.Product warranty costs are nominal for all periods presented. Research and Development Costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Income Taxes Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that the Company will not be able to utilize deferred income tax assets in the future. The Company is required to make a determination of any of its tax positions federal and state for which the sustainability of the position, based upon the technical merits, is uncertain. The Company regularly evaluates all tax positions taken and the likelihood of those positions being sustained. If management is highly confident that the position will be allowed and there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the full amount of the tax position will be ultimately realized, the company recognizes the full benefit associated with the tax position. Additionally, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for the fair value of the awards on the date granted on a straight-line basis over their vesting term. Compensation expense is recognized only for share-based payments expected to vest. The Company estimates forfeitures at the date of grant based on the Companys historical experience and future expectations. As of December 31, 2010, the unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested option awards was $03 million and such amount will be recognized in operations over a weighted average period of 206 years.As of December 31, 2010, the unrecognized stock-based compensation cost related to non-vested stock awards was $23 million and such amount will be recognized in operations over a weighted average period of 245 years. Stock compensation charged to operations was $24 million in 2010, $13 million in 2009 and $15 million in 2008. Loss Per Common Share The basic and diluted loss per common share amount is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding during the periods. All in-the-money stock options and shares issuable upon the conversion of the 545% Convertible Notes due 2010 and the 545% Convertible Notes due 2011 were anti-dilutive.  51  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts Foreign Currency Translation Substantially all foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. Therefore, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Translation gains and losses related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency different from a subsidiarys functional currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Fluctuating foreign exchange rates may significantly impact the Companys operating results and cash flows.During 2008, the Company periodically hedged forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain operating expenses.All derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.For a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in operations.For a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income.If the derivative used in an economic hedging activity is not designated in an accounting
hedging relationship or if it becomes ineffective, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in operations. Subsequent Events Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date the accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to the Company.In the case where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement effects the Companys financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial reporting, and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Companys financials properly reflect the change. New pronouncements assessed by the Company are discussed below In October2009, the FASB issued an update related to ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASC 605. This update removes the  criterion from the separation criteria used to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting, replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosuresguidance, provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price, eliminates
the use of the residual method for allocation, and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-14, Software Topic 985-Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements and changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements. Under this guidance, tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product essential functionality are excluded from the software revenue guidance in Subtopic 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition. In addition, hardware components of a tangible product containing software components are always excluded from the software revenue guidance. This update is effective for new or materially
modified arrangements for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010 and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.  52  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts In February 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events Topic 855 - Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. ASU 2010-09 requires an entity that is an SEC filer to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued and removes the requirement that an SEC filer disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated. ASC 2010-09 was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this standard had no effect on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition Milestone Method Topic 605: Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition. This standard provides that the milestone method is a valid application of the proportional performance model for revenue recognition if the milestones are substantive and there is substantive uncertainty about whether the milestones will be achieved. Determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement. To meet the definition of a substantive milestone, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone 1 would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item
delivered, 2 would have to relate solely to past performance, and 3 should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement. No bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement. The Company adopted this standard on July 1, 2010. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December2010, FASB issued ASU No2010-28, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic 350. Under Topic 350, testing for goodwill impairment is a two-step test. When a goodwill impairment test is performed either on an annual or interim basis, an entity must assess whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value Step 1. If it does, an entity must perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of that impairment Step 2. The amendments in this update modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is
more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of this update will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. The Company has considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Note 2.Fair Value Measurements The Company applies fair value standards for recurring financial assets and liabilities only.The accounting framework for determining fair value includes a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to measure fair value, which enables the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements. The fair value hierarchy consists of three tiers as follows Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets are available for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 Unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As of December 31, 2010, the Companys financial assets included short term investments and investments in non-publicly traded companies. The Company considers net realizable value for its investments in non-publicly traded companies for purposes of determining asset impairment losses. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company had no impairment losses on investments in non-publicly traded companies.  53  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts The carrying amounts for cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their immediate or short-term nature of the maturity. The fair value of the outstanding 2011 Notes was estimated at approximately $38 million as of December 31, 2010 and $88 million as of December 31, 2009. The 2011 Notes approximate fair value based on market rates available to the Company for financing with similar terms.The carrying value of such notes was approximately $38 million as of December 31, 2010 and $88 million as of December 31, 2009.The fair value of short term investments was $10 million as of December 31, 2010 which is based on a Level 2 valuation technique. There were no short-term investments as of December 31, 2009. Note 3.Reverse Stock Split On November 23, 2009 the Company effectuated a one-for-eight reverse stock split of the Company common stock. Retroactive restatement has been given to all share numbers in this report, and accordingly, all amounts including per share amounts are shown on a post-split basis. Note 4.Acquisitions On October 24, 2008, the Company acquired Centillium Communications, Inc. Centillium, a Delaware corporation. Centillium was a global company with headquarters in Fremont, CA and delivered highly innovative communications processing technology. The acquisition was financed with the issuance of 3,125,000 shares of the Companys common stock with an approximate fair value of $250 million and $150 million of cash. The Company incurred transaction costs of approximately $26 million which resulted in a total purchase price of approximately $426 million. In connection with the acquisition of Centillium, the Company implemented a worldwide reduction in Centilliums workforce which was implemented and concluded during the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. As such, the Company
to incurred cash expenditures of approximately $34 million primarily for employee related costs and such costs were added to the Companys purchase price of Centillium and allocated to the net assets acquired. The results of operations of Centillium have been included in the Company consolidated financial results from October 24, 2008. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. The Company has allocated the cost to acquire Centillium to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with the remaining amount classified as goodwill.None of the amount allocated to goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax reporting purposes. The total purchase price of the Centillium acquisition has been allocated in the Company consolidated financial statements as follows Current assets 34,246 Property, plant and equipment 709 Long-term investments 992 Other intangible assets1 10,600 Goodwill 15,004 Obligation under deferred revenue 23 Accounts payable accrued expenses 14,158 Restructuring reserve 4,798 Purchase price 42,572 Less Common stock issued 24,950 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 24,991 Net cash provided by used for acquisitions 7,369  1 The valuation of Centilliums customer relationships of $78 million was determined based on their estimated fair value at the acquisition date. The excess earnings methodology of the income approach was the technique used to value such relationships. The value assigned to Centilliums customer relationships is being amortized ratably over ten years, which represents the estimated average remaining useful life. The valuation of developed technology of Centillium of $28 million was determined based on its estimated fair value at the acquisition date. A form of the income approach known as the relief-from-royalty method was the technique used to value developed technology.The developed technology is being amortized ratably over five to seven years, which represents the estimated average remaining useful life.  54  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 5.Restricted Cash At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys liquidity is affected by restricted cash balances of approximately $06 million and $27 million, respectively, which are included in current assets and are not available for general corporate use. The Company has pledged these amounts as collateral for stand-by letters of credit that guarantee certain long-term property lease obligations and to support customer credit requirements. Note 6.Investments in Non-Publicly Traded Companies and Venture Capital Funds During the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold its investment in Opulan Technologies Corp. Opulan for $27 million. The carrying value of this investment in Opulan was also $27 million and accordingly no gain or loss was recorded on this transaction. The Company owns a 3% limited partnership interest in Neurone II, a venture capital fund organized as a limited partnership and a 042% limited partnership interest in Munich Venture Partners Fund MVP.The Company accounts for these investments at cost.The financial condition of these companies is subject to significant changes resulting from their operating performance and their ability to obtain financing.The Company continually evaluates its investments in these companies for impairment. In making this judgment, the Company considers the investees cash position, projected cash flows both short and long-term, financing needs, most recent valuation data, the current investing environment, management/ownership changes, and competition. This evaluation
process is based on information that the Company requests from these privately held companies. This information is not subject to the same disclosure and audit requirements as the reports required of U.S. public companies, and as such, the reliability and accuracy of the data may vary. During 2008, the Company made additional investments of approximately $01 million in MVP. During 2009, the Company made additional investments of less than $01 million and recognized an impairment of less than $01 million on its investment in Neurone II.

In assessing the realizability, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. Based on this assessment, management believes that significant uncertainty exists concerning the recoverability of the deferred income tax assets. As such, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred income tax assets as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Of the $2275 million valuation allowance at December 31, 2010, subsequently recognized income tax benefits, if any, in the amount of $47 million will be applied directly to additional paid-in capital. At December 31, 2010, the Company had available, for federal income tax purposes, net operating loss NOL carry-forwards of approximately $461 million and research and development tax credit carry-forwards of approximately $211 million expiring in varying amounts from 2010 through 2030. For state income tax purposes, the Company had available NOL carry-forwards of approximately $1691 million and state tax credit carry-forwards of $78 million expiring in varying amounts from 2010 to 2030.Additionally, the Company has generated $217 million of NOLs in foreign jurisdictions which can be carried forward indefinitely. Certain transactions involving the Companys beneficial ownership have occurred in prior years, which resulted in a stock ownership change for purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Consequently, approximately $2007 million of the NOL carry-forwards and $113 million of research and development tax credit carry-forwards are subject to these limitations. The Company has not yet determined if any of the NOL and credits generated through 2010 will be subject to limitation under Section 382.  60  TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In the event of an infringement claim, the Company retains the right to i procure for the customer the right to continue using the product; ii replace the product with a non-infringing item which shall give equally good service; iii modify the product so that it becomes non-infringing; or iv remove the product and, on return of the product to the Company, the Company shall refund the buyers purchase price. Due to the nature of these indemnification agreements, the maximum potential future
payments the Company could be required to make under these guarantees, when and if such claims may arise, cannot be reliably determined.
