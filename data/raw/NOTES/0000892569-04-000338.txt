The other schedules have not been submitted

International In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Valeant
Pharmaceuticals International and its subsidiaries formerly
known as ICN Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects,
the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note1 in Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002 and
as a result changed its method of accounting for goodwill.

1.
Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies Organization:
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Valeant,
formerly known as ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its subsidiaries
collectively, the Company was formed in November
1994, as a result of the merger of ICN
Pharmaceuticals,Inc., SPI Pharmaceuticals,Inc.,
Viratek,Inc. and ICN Biomedicals,Inc.
Biomedicals. The Company is a global,
research-based, specialty pharmaceutical company that discovers,
develops, manufactures, and markets a broad range of
pharmaceutical products. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Ribapharm,Inc. Ribapharm, which conducts
research and new product development initiatives, the Company
generates royalty revenues from the sale of ribavirin by
Schering-Plough Ltd. Schering-Plough and F.
Hoffman-LaRoche Roche. Principles of
Consolidation: The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Valeant, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and all of its
majority-owned subsidiaries that it controls. Minority interest
in results of operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents
the minority shareholders share of the income or loss of
such consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Cash and Cash
Equivalents: Cash equivalents include
repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, money market
funds and municipal debt securities which have maturities of
three months or less. For purposes of the consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time
of purchase to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these
assets approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of
these instruments. At December31, 2003 and 2002, cash
equivalents totaled $158,686,000 and $195,597,000, respectively. Marketable Equity and Debt
Securities: The Company classifies its
existing marketable equity securities as available for sale in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These securities
are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and
losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of
other comprehensive income. The Company had $15,876,000 and
$13,497,000 of marketable equity and debt securities, which are
included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as
of December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts: The Company evaluates the
collectibility of its receivables on a regular basis. The
allowance is based upon various factors including the financial
condition and payment history of major customers, an overall
review of collections experience on other accounts and economic
factors or events expected to affect our future collections
experience. Inventories:
Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
The Company evaluates the carrying value of its inventories on a
regular basis, taking into account such factors as historical
and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand,
the price the Company expects to obtain for its products in
their respective markets compared with historical cost and the
remaining shelf life of goods on hand. Property, Plant and
Equipment: Property, plant and
equipment are stated at cost. The Company primarily uses the
straight-line method for depreciating property, plant and
equipment over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and
related improvements are depreciated from 750years,
machinery and equipment from 315years, furniture and
fixtures from 320years and leasehold improvements
and capital leases are amortized over their useful lives,
limited to the life of the related lease. The Company follows
the policy of capitalizing expenditures that materially increase
the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and
repairs to expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and
related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated
from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
included in income. The Company periodically evaluates the
carrying value of property, plant and equipment. In evaluating
property, plant and 49 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued equipment, the Company determines whether there
has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to be generated by the property,
plant and equipment with its carrying value. If the undiscounted
cash flows is less than the carrying value, the amount of the
impairment, if any, will be determined by comparing the carrying
value of the property, plant and equipment with its fair value.
Fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows
analysis or independent appraisals. Acquired In-Process Research and
Development: In the year ended
December31, 2003, the Company incurred an expense of
$117,609,000 associated with acquired in-process research and
development IPRD related to the acquisition
of the minority interest of Ribapharm the Ribapharm
Acquisition. The amount expensed as IPRD represents
an estimate of the fair value of purchased in-process technology
for projects that, as of the acquisition date, had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future
use. The data used to determine the respective fair values
requires significant judgment. Differences in those judgments
would have the impact of changing the allocation of purchase
price to goodwill, which is an unamortizable intangible asset.
The estimated fair value of these projects was based on the use
of discounted cash flow model based on an estimate of future
sales and an average gross margin of 85%. For each project, the
estimated after-tax cash flows using a tax rate of 25% were
probability weighted to take account of the stage of completion
and the risks surrounding the successful development and
commercialization. The assumed tax rate of 25% is the
Companys estimate of the effective tax rate for
acquisitions of similar type of assets. These cash flows were
then discounted to a present value using a discount rate of 15 which is the Companys after tax weighted average cost of
capital. In addition, solely for the purposes of estimating the
fair value of these IPRD projects as of August25,
2003, the following assumptions were made Future research and development costs of
approximately $150,000,000 would be incurred to complete the
IPRD projects. These future costs are primarily for
PhaseIII testing of Viramidine and PhaseII and III
testing of remofovir formerly referred to as Hepavir B. The IPRD projects, which were in various
stages of development from PhaseI to PhaseII
clinical trials, are expected to reach completion by the end of
2006. The major risks and uncertainties associated with
the timely and successful completion of these projects consist
of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the
technology based on the data from clinical trials and obtaining
necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, no assurance can be
given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash
flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects
will materialize, as estimated. For these reasons, among others,
actual results may vary significantly from the estimated
results. For example, in October 2003, Roche notified the
Company that it is abandoning development of Levovirin. Goodwill and Intangible
Assets: In July 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations, and SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
SFASNo141 requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after
June30, 2001. Under SFASNo142, goodwill will
no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment
tests in accordance with the statement. Other intangible assets
will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. On
January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo142. During the second quarter of 2002, the
Company completed the transitional impairment test required by
SFASNo142. As a result, the Company recorded an
impairment loss of $25,332,000, which was offset by a benefit of
$3,541,000 for the write-off of negative goodwill. The net
amount of $21,791,000 has been recorded as a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principle in the year ended
December31, 2002. 50 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS

The change in goodwill from December31,
2002 to December31, 2003 relates to goodwill in the
Ribapharm Acquisition. See Note3. Estimated amortization expense for the years
ending December31, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 is
$49,000,000, $44,000,000, $43,000,000, $42,000,000 and
$35,000,000, respectively. Revenue Recognition:
Revenues and related cost of product sales are recorded at the
time of shipment and when title passes to the customer, provided
that collection of the revenue is reasonably assured. Allowances
for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of our
historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from
which they originated. Adjustments are made to the accrual based
upon estimated inventory levels, expiration dating, and product
demand at our major wholesalers. The sales return is recorded as
a reduction of product sales. The Company earns royalty revenue
as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to
third parties. Royalty revenue is earned at the time the
products subject to the royalty are sold by the third party and
is reduced by an estimate for discounts and rebates that will be
paid in subsequent periods for those products sold during the
current period. Foreign Currency
Translation: The assets and
liabilities of our foreign operations are translated at end of
period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at
the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the
period. The effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on
translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into
U.S.dollars are accumulated in stockholders equity. Income Taxes: Income
taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No109 is an
asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequence of events that have been recognized in the
Companys financial statements or tax returns. A valuation
allowance is established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount expected to be realized. In estimating
future tax consequences, SFAS No109 generally considers
all expected future events other than an enactment of changes in
tax laws or rates. Use of Estimates:
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Comprehensive
Income: The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income. Accumulated other comprehensive loss consists of
accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized
losses on marketable equity securities and minimum pension
liability. Other comprehensive loss has not been recorded net of
any tax provision or benefit as the Company does not expect to
realize any significant tax benefit or expenses from these items. Per Share
Information: Basic earnings per share
is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. In
computing diluted earnings per share 51 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the weighted-average number of shares outstanding
is adjusted to reflect the effect of potentially dilutive
securities including options, warrants, and convertible debt or
preferred stock; income available to common stockholders is
adjusted to reflect any changes in income or loss that would
result from the issuance of the dilutive common shares. The Companys Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash distribution of $00775 per share for each fiscal
quarter of 2003 and 2002. During 2001, the Companys Board
of Directors declared a quarterly cash distribution of $00750
per share for each fiscal quarter. While the Company has
historically paid quarterly cash dividends, there can be no
assurance that it will continue to do so. Stock-Based
Compensation: The Company has adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No123 and SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
Compensation cost for stock-based compensation issued to
employees has been measured using the instrinsic value method
provided by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
options granted under the Companys 2003 Equity Incentive
Plan the Incentive Plan which amends and restates
the 1998 Stock Option Plan the Option Plan as all
options granted under the Option Plan had an exercise price
equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant excluding options issued in exchange for
Ribapharm stock options See Note2. Had
compensation cost for the Option Plan been determined based on
the fair value at the grant date for awards in 2003, 2002 and
2001 consistent with the provisions of SFASNo123,
the Companys net income and earnings per share would have

Reclassifications:
Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform with
the current year presentation, with no effect on previously
reported net income or stockholders equity. New Accounting
Pronouncements: In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation No.FIN45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others. FIN45 clarifies the requirements of
SFASNo5, Accounting for Contingencies,
relating to a guarantors accounting for, and disclosure
of, the issuance of certain types of guarantees. FIN45
requires the recognition of a liability at fair value, by a
guarantor, at the inception of a guarantee. The disclosure
requirements of FIN45 are effective for financial
statements of interim or annual periods that end after
December15, 2002, while the initial recognition and
measurement provisions are effective on a prospective basis for
guarantees that are issued or modified after December31,
2002. We have 52 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued adopted the disclosure requirements of
FIN45. However, we have not issued or modified any
material guarantees since December31, 2002. In January2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. SFAS No143 addresses
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. The adoption of this standard did not
have a material impact on the companys consolidated
financial statements. In January 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS
No146 requires that a liability for a cost associated
with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the
liability is incurred rather than when a commitment to an exit
plan is made. The adoption of SFAS No146 did not have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. In January 2003, the Company adopted the
provisions of SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure, An Amendment
of FASB Statement No123. SFAS No148 provides
alternatives for a voluntary change to the fair value based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, SFAS No148 amends the disclosure requirements
of SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, to require prominent disclosures in annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect in measuring
compensation expense. The Company will continue to account for
stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method and it
has adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No148. In April 2003, the FASB issued
SFASNo149, Amendment of Statement133 on
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends
and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and
for hedging activities under SFAS No133 and is effective
for contracts entered into or modified after June30, 2003.
The adoption of SFAS No149 did not have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No150,
Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS
No150 provides guidance with respect to the
classification and measurement of certain financial instruments
with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. This
statement requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within its scope as a liability rather than,
under previous guidance, as equity. SFAS No150 is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the
beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No150 did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In December 2003, the Staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
No104 SAB104, Revenue
Recognition, which supercedes SAB101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB104s
primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in
SAB101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
superceded as a result of the issuance of EITF00-21,
Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables. SAB104 did not have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

Ribapharm In April 2002, the Company completed an
underwritten public offering of 29,900,000shares of common
stock, par value $001per share, of Ribapharm, previously
a wholly-owned subsidiary, representing 1993% of the total
outstanding common stock of Ribapharm the Ribapharm
Offering. In connection with the Ribapharm Offering, the
Company received net cash proceeds of $276,611,000 and recorded
a gain on the sale of Ribapharms stock of $261,937,000,
net of offering costs. In connection with the Ribapharm Offering, the
Company paid cash bonuses to its officers, directors and
employees totaling $47,839,000 in April 2002. The Company is
seeking to recover a portion of these bonuses 53 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued See Note13 Commitments and
Contingencies Derivative Actions. Additionally, the
Company paid other professional fees of $13,000,000 related to
the structuring of Ribapharm in April 2002. These amounts are
included in the Companys statements of income in general
and administrative expenses. In August 2003, the Company repurchased the 20%
minority interest in its Ribapharm subsidiary for an aggregate
total purchase price of $207,658,000 the Ribapharm
Acquisition. The Company paid $625 in cash for each of
the 29,900,703 outstanding publicly held shares of Ribapharm.
Additionally, the Company included the fair value of the
Companys stock options issued in exchange for outstanding
Ribapharm stock options in the purchase price. The fair value of
stock options issued were determined based on a $1543 stock
price, the closing stock price on August22, 2003, using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model assuming an expected
life of 42years, weighted average risk-free rate of 23 volatility of 62% and dividends of $031. The acquisition
increased the Companys ownership of Ribapharm to a 100%
interest and was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The results of operations of Ribapharm have always
been included in the consolidated income before minority
interest of the Company. Prior to the acquisition, the minority
interest in the Ribapharm income was excluded from the
Companys consolidated net income. Since the date of
acquisition on August25, 2003, no minority interest exists
in Ribapharm and, accordingly, the consolidated net income
includes the full amount of Ribapharms results from this
date. As a result of the acquisition, minority interest included
on the Companys consolidated balance sheet relating to
Ribapharm as of the acquisition date has been eliminated. The
remaining minority interest as of December31, 2003 relates
to foreign subsidiaries. The purchase price of the Ribapharm Acquisition

The aggregate purchase price was allocated to

fair value using a discounted cash flow model. The intangible
asset related to the ribavirin license agreements with
Schering-Plough and Roche is amortized using an estimated useful
life of five years. Identifiable intangible assets related to
Viramidine, remofovir formerly referred to as HepavirB
and Levovirin totaled approximately $101,000,000, $12,000,000
and $5,000,000, respectively, and are expensed as in-process
research and development as the technological feasibility of
these assets has not occurred. Subsequent to the Ribapharm
Acquisition, Roche notified the Company that it was no longer
developing Levovirin. The Company recorded deferred compensation
cost related to the unvested intrinsic value of the
Companys options issued in exchange for unvested Ribapharm
options, which will be amortized over 54 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS

Discontinued Operations In the second half of 2002, the Company made a
strategic decision to divest its Russian Pharmaceuticals
segment, biomedicals segment, Photonics business, raw materials
businesses and manufacturing capability in Central Europe and
Circe unit. The results of the discontinued businesses have
been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment of Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets. The consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to discontinued operations presentation
for all historical periods presented. In June 2003, the Company sold its Russian
Pharmaceuticals segment and certain assets of its biomedicals
segment. The Company received gross proceeds of $55,000,000 in
cash for the Russian Pharmaceuticals segment and received
727,990shares of its common stock that was held by the
purchaser, which had a fair market value of approximately
$12,369,000, for the assets of its biomedicals segment. The
Company recorded a net loss on disposal of discontinued
operations of $8,158,000, net of a tax benefit of approximately
$10,161,000, related to the sale of these businesses in the year
ended December31, 2003. On September30, 2003, the Company sold the
remaining assets of its biomedicals segment, Dosimetry for gross
cash proceeds of $58,000,000. The Company recorded a net gain on
disposal of discontinued operations of $23,608,000, net of taxes
of $15,526,000, related to the sale of Dosimetry in the year
ended December31, 2003. The Company disposed of the Circe unit in the
fourth quarter of 2002 for a nominal sales price. 55 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

two stages. First, it discontinued the medical services business
in September 2002. Second, the Company sold the laser device
business in March 2003 for approximately $505,000. The Company is actively marketing for sale the
raw materials businesses and manufacturing capability in Central

Manufacturing Restructuring During the third quarter of 2003, the Company
approved restructuring plans to establish a global manufacturing
and supply chain network of five manufacturing sites, which will
result in the closing of ten of the Companys current
manufacturing sites the Manufacturing Restructuring
Plan. The Manufacturing Restructuring Plan includes a
refocus of the Companys international operations to
improve profitability and achieve greater operating
efficiencies. A review for potential impairment was performed in
accordance with SFASNo144, Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets. In determining asset groups, the Company
grouped assets 56 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued at the lowest level for which independent
identifiable cash flows were available. In determining whether
an asset was impaired, the Company compared undiscounted future
cash flows and asset residual values to the asset group carrying
value on a site by site basis. The impairment analysis indicated
that the asset groups were not impaired, therefore, no
impairment losses were recognized in 2003. Based on the
remaining useful lives of the manufacturing sites to be disposed
of, the book value would exceed the residual value on the
estimated disposal date for five of the manufacturing sites. As
a result, the Company has revised the depreciation period on
these assets and will incur an additional annual depreciation
expense of $6,400,000 through the third quarter of 2005, which
is the expected completion date. The total costs to dispose of
the plants cannot be reasonably estimated at this time as the
Company is still in the process of evaluating the disposal
strategy at each site. The Company intends to dispose of each
manufacturing plant by selling it to a buyer who intends to
continue to operate the plant, including assets and employee
obligations. However, the Company may not locate a buyer for
each manufacturing plant, which would require the Company to
close the certain manufacturing plants and incur additional
severance charges. The Company recorded $1,609,000 and $2,400,000 in
cost of goods sold at its pharmaceuticals segments related to
accelerated depreciation and severance, respectively, in 2003.

direction, the Company evaluated the net realizable value of
certain long-lived assets, including capitalized offering costs
related to the proposed public offering of ICN
InternationalAG, the Companys corporate aircraft and
other assets. The Company concluded that due to the passage of
time and the strategic business review, the capitalized offering
costs of ICN InternationalAG of $18,295,000 should be
written-off. Also, an impairment charge of $9,100,000 was
recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the
fair value of the corporate aircraft, as determined by
appraisals. The Company incurred a significant amount of
professional fees in connection with proxy contests in 2002.

Change of Control As a result of the May29, 2002 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders, three persons nominated by Franklin
Mutual Advisors, LLC and Iridian Asset Management LLC were
elected to the Board of Directors. Under the terms of employment
agreements with some key executives, a long-term stock incentive
plan and the Option Plan, the results of the 2002 election,
together with the results of the 2001 election, constitute a
change of control the Change of Control. Under the terms of a long-term incentive plan,
all restricted stock awards vested immediately upon the Change
of Control on June11, 2002. As a result, compensation
expense of $12,022,000 was recorded in the year ended
December31, 2002. The Option Plan provided that all options
immediately vested and that an option holder had sixty days
following the Change of Control to elect to surrender his or her
nonqualified options to the Company for a cash payment to the
excess of the highest closing market price of the stock during
the 90days preceding the Change of Control, which was
$3250per share, or the closing market price on the day
preceding the date of surrender, whichever is higher, over the
exercise price for the surrendered options. During the year
ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded a charge of
$61,400,000 related to the cash payment obligation under the
Option Plan. Under employment agreements the Company had with
some of its former key executives, the Company had payment
obligations that were triggered upon a termination of the
executives employment either by the Company or the
executive following the Change of Control. During the third
quarter of 2002, the Company triggered its payment obligations
and recorded an obligation for the payments to the executives
totaling $15,507,000. The Company recorded expenses of
$3,201,000 for employee termination and severance benefits in
2002 unrelated to the aforementioned executive employment
agreements. This amount primarily relates to severance related
to former employees and the restructuring of the Companys
ICN International headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. In
addition, on June19, 2002, Mr.Milan Panic, the
Companys former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of
the Board, resigned with immediate effect from his positions as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and from all positions he
held as a director or officer of any of the Companys
affiliates. Mr.Panic also resigned as one of the
Companys employees with effect from June30, 2002 and
is no longer one of the Companys directors. In connection
with Mr.Panics termination, the Company recorded
severance expense of $12,000,000 in the year ended
December31, 2002.

INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the amounts recorded in the 2002 tax provision.
Of the valuation allowance change, a 3% benefit is attributable
to an amount in the historical valuation allowance that was
specifically established for net operating loss adjustments. The
net operating loss adjustments should be considered net of this
change. Included in State tax and other is an effective
tax rate benefit of 2% relating to research and development
credits. The research and development credit benefit includes
current and prior year amounts. A 2% addition in the valuation allowance was made
for foreign net operating losses. During 2003, no United States income or foreign
withholding taxes were provided on the undistributed earnings of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries with the exception of
the Companys Panamanian subsidiary, since management
intends to reinvest those undistributed earnings in the foreign
operations. Included in consolidated accumulated deficit at
December31, 2003 is approximately $379,213,000 of
accumulated earnings of foreign operations that would be subject
to United States income or foreign withholdings taxes, if and
when repatriated. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a
consolidated U.S.federal income tax return. These returns
have either been audited or settled through statute expiration
through the year 1996. The Company and its consolidated
subsidiaries are currently under examination for years 1997
through 2001. Other audits are in process for some of the
non-U.S.subsidiaries. The Company believes the additional
tax liability, if any, for such years and subsequent years, will
not have a material effect on the financial position, operating
results or cash flows of the Company. At December31, 2003, the Company has
domestic and foreign net operating losses of approximately
$147,847,000 and $39,324,000, respectively. The Companys
domestic and foreign net operating losses begin to expire in the
year 2018 and 2007, respectively. The primary components of the Companys net

In 2003 and 2002, the valuation allowance
primarily relates to foreign net operating losses and a
$12,548,000 benefit from the exercise of stock options included
in the net operating loss carryforward. Ultimate realization of
the deferred tax asset is dependent upon the Company generating
sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss
carryforwards. Although realization is not assured, management
believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax
asset will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax asset
considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the future
if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are reduced. 60 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS

40%Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013, discussed in
Note11, allows the Company to settle any conversion by
remitting to the note holder the principal amount of the note in
cash, while settling the conversion spread the excess
conversion value over the accreted value in the shares of the
Companys common stock. The accounting for convertible debt
with such settlement features is addressed in EITF Issue
No90-19, Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to
Settle for Cash Upon Conversion. It is the Companys
intent to settle the notes conversion obligations
consistent with InstrumentC of EITF90-19. Only the
conversion spread, which will be settled in stock, will result
in potential dilution in the Companys earnings-per-share
computations as the accreted value of the notes will be settled
for cash upon the conversion. 61 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS

On December12, 2003, the Company issued
$300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7%Senior Notes
due 2011 the 70% Notes. Ribapharm is a co-obligor
on the notes, but only for so long as it shall have outstanding
obligations under the 61/2%Convertible Subordinated
Notes due 2008 the 61/2%Notes, originally issued
under an indenture among the Company, Ribapharm and the trustee.
Interest on the 70%Notes is payable semi-annually on
June15 and December15 of each year. The Company may,
at its option, redeem some or all of the 70% Notes at any time
on or after December15, 2007, at a redemption price of
10350%, 10175% and 10000% of the principal amount during the
twelve-month period beginning December15, 2007, 2008 and
2009 and thereafter, respectively. In addition, on or prior to
December15, 2006, the Company may, at its option, redeem
up to 35% of the 7% Notes with the proceeds of certain sales of
its equity at the redemption price 1070% of the principal
amount provided that at least 65% of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes issued remains outstanding after the
redemption. The 7% Notes are senior unsecured obligations. They
rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future
subordinated indebtedness of the Companys and, so long as
Ribapharm is a co-obligor on the notes, Ribapharm. The indenture
governing the 7% Notes include certain convenants which may
restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the payment
of dividends and other restricted payments, the creation of
certain liens, the sale of assets or the ability to consolidate
or merge with another entity, subject to qualifications and
exceptions. 63 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Subsequent to year-end, the Company entered into
an interest rate swap agreement with respect to $150,000,000 in
principal amount of the Senior Notes. See Note19
Subsequent Events for a description of the interest
rate swap arrangement. On November19, 2003, the Company issued
$240,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 30%Convertible
Subordinated Notes due 2010 the 30%Notes
and $240,000,000 aggregate principal amount of
40%Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2013 the
40%Notes, which were issued as two series of
notes under a single indenture among the Company, Ribapharm and
the trustee. Ribapharm is a co-obligor on both series of notes
but only for so long as Ribapharm has outstanding obligations
under the 61/2%Notes. Interest on the
30%Notes is payable semi-annually on February16 and
August16 of each year. Interest on the 40%Notes is
payable semi-annually on May15 and November15 of
each year. The Company has the right to redeem the
30%Notes, in whole or in part, at their principal amount
on or after May20, 2011. The 30%Notes and
40%Notes are convertible into the Companys common
stock at a conversion rate of 316336shares per $1,000
principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment. Upon
conversion, the Company will have the right to satisfy its
conversion obligations by delivery, at its option of either
shares of its common stock, cash or a combination thereof. It is
the Companys intent to settle the principal amount of the
30%Notes and 40%Notes in cash. The 30%Notes
and 40%Notes are subordinated unsecured obligations of
the Company and Ribapharm for so long as Ribapharm has
outstanding obligations under the 61/2%Notes,
ranking in right of payment behind the Companys senior
debt, including the 70%Notes. In connection with the
above note offerings, the Company used a portion of the proceeds
to retire $139,589,000 aggregate principal amount of its
61/2%Notes, resulting in a loss on early
extinguishment of debt of $12,803,000. In connection with the offering of the
30%Notes and the 40%Notes, the Company entered
into convertible note hedge and written call option transactions
with respect to the Companys common stock the
Convertible NoteHedge. The Convertible
NoteHedge consisted of the Company purchasing a call
option on 12,653,440shares of the Companys common
stock at a strike price of $3161 and selling a written call
option on the identical number of shares at $3952. The number
of shares covered by the Hedge is the same number of shares
underlying the conversion of $200million principal amount
of the 30%Notes and $200million principal amount of
the 40%Notes. The Convertible NoteHedge is expected
to reduce the potential dilution from conversion of the notes.
The written call option sold offset, to some extent, the cost of
the written call option purchased. The net cost of the
Convertible NoteHedge of $42,880,000 was recorded as the
sale of a permanent equity instrument pursuant to guidance in
EITF00-19. In April 2002, the Company used a portion of the
proceeds of the Ribapharm Offering to complete its tender offer
and consent solicitation for all of its outstanding
83/4%Senior Notes due 2008. The redemption of these
notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of
$43,268,000. In July and August 2002, the Company repurchased
$59,410,000 principal amount of its 61/2%Notes. In
connection with these repurchases, the Company recorded a gain
on early extinguishment of debt of $17,538,000. The net loss on
extinguishment of debt was $25,730,000 for the year ended
December31, 2002. In July 2001, the Company completed an offering
of $525,000,000 of 61/2%Notes. Ribapharm is a
co-obligor on the notes. The Company will have the right to
redeem the 61/2%Notes, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after July21, 2004. The Company may redeem the
notes at 103714% of their principal amount between
July21, 2004, and July15, 2005; at 102786% of their
principal amount between July16, 2005, and July15,
2006; at 101857% of their principal amount between
July16, 2006, and July15, 2007; and at 100929% of
their principal amount after July16, 2007. The
61/2%Notes are convertible into shares of our common
stock at a conversion price of approximately $3425per
share, subject to adjustment. The notes are subordinated
unsecured obligations of the Company and Ribapharm, ranking in
right of payment behind the Companys senior debt and pari
passu with the 30%Notes and 40%Notes. 64 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

due 2005. In connection with these repurchases, the Company
recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $20,897,000. The Company has mortgages totaling $13,469,000

credit aggregating $8,129,000 under which no borrowings were
outstanding at December31, 2003. The lines of credit
provide for short-term borrowings and bear interest at variable
rates based upon LIBOR or other indices.

Common Stock In April 2003, the Company implemented its
Incentive Plan, which is an amendment and restatement of its
Amended and Restated 1998 Stock Option Plan. The Incentive Plan
increases the number of shares of common stock available for
issuance from 11,604,000 to 18,104,000 in the aggregate. The
Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock
options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, phantom stock and stock bonuses
collectively awards to key employees, officers,
directors, consultants and advisors of the Company. Options
granted under the Incentive Plan must have an exercise price
that is not less than 85% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant and a term not exceeding
10years. Under the Incentive Plan, 500,000shares may
be issued as phantom stock awards or restricted stock awards for
which a participant pays less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Options vest ratably over a
four year period from the date of grant. The following table sets forth information

$14,295,000 and $2,333,000, respectively. The long-term
incentive plan was terminated on December19, 2003. Contingently Issuable
Shares: Effective October1,
1998, the Company issued 2,883,871shares of its common
stock to Roche as part of the consideration for the rights to
four pharmaceutical products. Under the terms of the agreement
with Roche, the Company guaranteed to Roche a per share price
initially at $3100, increasing at a rate of 6%per annum

stock of $515,000. In January 2003, the Company issued

Commitments and Contingencies Ribapharm Tender Offer
Litigation: In June 2003, seven
purported class actions on behalf of certain stockholders of
Ribapharm were filed against the Company, Ribapharm and certain
directors and officers of Ribapharm in the Delaware Court of
Chancery. Six of these complaints were consolidated under the
caption In re Ribapharm Inc. Shareholders Litigation,
Consol. C.A. No20337. The seventh suit has not yet been
formally consolidated into C.A. No20337 but is proceeding
in coordination with the consolidated case. On June26,
2003, the plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a First
Amended ClassAction Complaint naming only the Company as a
defendant. The First Amended ClassAction Complaint
alleges, among other things, that the Company breached its
fiduciary duties as a controlling stockholder of Ribapharm in
connection with its tender offer for the shares of Ribapharm it
did not already own. On August4, 2003, the Company and the
plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle these
lawsuits for a nominal amount and, after settlement papers are
prepared, will present that settlement to the Court of Chancery
for its approval. On June25, 2003, the Company instituted a
suit captioned ICN Pharmaceuticals,Inc.v.
Ribapharm,Inc., Daniel J. Paracka, Santo J. Costa, Gregory
F. Boron, James Pieczynski and Andre Dimitriadis, C.A.
No20387 for declaratory and injunctive relief against
Ribapharm and certain of its directors in the Delaware Court of
Chancery. This complaint alleges, among other things, that the
defendants breached their fiduciary duties and certain contracts
by implementing a shareholder rights plan in response to the
Companys tender offer. The Company requested a preliminary
injunction hearing prior to the expiration of the tender offer
on July22, 2003 and sought a temporary restraining order
barring the defendants from taking certain actions with respect
to Ribapharms newly enacted shareholders rights plan. On
June30, 2003, the Court of Chancery scheduled a
preliminary injunction hearing for September3, 2003. This
hearing did not occur because the parties had reached an
agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit for a nominal
amount. On June27, 2003, a purported class action
on behalf of certain stockholders of Ribapharm was filed against
the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery. This class action
is captioned Maxine Phillips, Robert Garfield, Nora Mazzini,
Andrew Samet, Kathleen A. Pasek, Richard Jacob and Steven
Silverbergv. ICN Pharmaceuticals,Inc., C.A.
No20391, and seeks a declaration that the shareholders
rights plan is valid and enforceable. This action has been
consolidated with the suit instituted by the Company on
June25, 2003 and captioned In re Ribapharm,Inc.
Rights Plan Litigation, Consol. C.A. No20387. On
August4, 2003, the Company and the plaintiffs reached an
agreement in principle to settle this lawsuit. Such settlement
will be completed in combination with the settlement In re
Ribapharm Inc. Shareholders Litigation, Consol. C.A.
No20337. On June3, 2003, a purported class action,
captioned Len Brodyv. Roberts A. Smith, Andre C.
Dimitriadis, Santo J. Costa, James J. Peiczynski, Daniel J.
Paracka, Gregory F. Boron, Ribapharm,Inc. and ICN
Pharmaceuticals,Inc., Case No03 CC 00211, was
filed in the Superior Court of Orange County, California,
against the Company, Ribapharm and certain of Ribapharms
officers and directors. The complaint in this action purports to
assert the same claims, on behalf of the same class of
plaintiffs and against the same defendants as in the seven
lawsuits filed in Delaware that are described above. This
California action has been stayed in light of the settlement of
the Delaware tender offer litigation. The settlement of the
Delaware tender offer litigation has been designed to release
the claims brought in this lawsuit, although the decision as to
effect of that release will be up to the California court. 68 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In the opinion of management, the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on
the Companys consolidated financial position, results of
operations or liquidity. Derivative Actions:
The Company is a nominal defendant in a shareholder derivative
lawsuit pending in state court in Orange County, California.
This lawsuit, which was filed on June6, 2002, purports to
assert derivative claims on behalf of the Company against
certain current and/or former officers and directors of the
Company. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary
duties, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of
corporate assets. The plaintiff seeks, among other things,
damages and a constructive trust over cash bonuses paid to the
officer and director defendants in connection with the Ribapharm
Offering the Ribapharm Bonuses. Because it is a
derivative lawsuit, the plaintiff does not seek recovery from
the Company but rather on behalf of the Company. On October1, 2002, several former and
current directors of the Company, as individuals, as well as the
Company, as a nominal defendant, were named as defendants in a
second shareholders derivative complaint filed in Delaware
Chancery Court. The complaint purports to state causes of action
for violation of Delaware General Corporate Law
Section144, breach of fiduciary duties and waste of
corporate assets in connection with the defendants
management of the Company. Because it is a derivative lawsuit,
the complaint does not seek recovery from the Company but rather
on behalf of the Company. The allegations largely duplicate
those contained in the derivative lawsuit filed in Orange
County, California, but add a disclosure-based claim relating to
the allegations of federal securities law violations made in the
class actions. The Company established a Special Litigation
Committee to evaluate the plaintiffs claims in both
derivative actions. The Special Litigation Committee concluded
that it would not be in the best interests of the Companys
shareholders to pursue many of the claims in these two lawsuits,
but decided to pursue, through litigation or settlement, claims
arising from the April 2002 decision of the Board to approve the
payment of approximately $50,000,000 in bonuses to various
members of the Board and management arising from the initial
public offering of Ribapharm. On April25, 2003, the
Company filed a motion to stay or dismiss the California
plaintiffs complaint in favor of the Company amending the
existing Delaware derivative action to substitute the Company as
the plaintiff. Following limited discovery pertaining to the
Special Litigation Committees investigation, the Court
granted the Companys motion. The Court stayed the
plaintiffs prosecution of the claim concerning the
Ribapharm Bonuses in favor of similar proceedings in Delaware,
and dismissed each of the plaintiffs remaining claims with
prejudice. On June27, 2003, pursuant to the Special
Litigation Committees recommendation, the Company filed a
motion in the Delaware derivative action to arealign
itself as plaintiff in this section, bpursue the primary
derivative claims relating to the Ribapharm Bonuses,
cseek dismissal of the secondary derivative claims, and
dsettle certain claims with respect to certain of the
defendants. The Court granted the Companys motion for
realignment on October27, 2003. Additional aspects of the
Companys motion are still pending. Securities
ClassActions: Since
July25, 2002, multiple class actions have been filed in
the United States District Courts for the Eastern District of
NewYork, the District of New Jersey and the Central
District of California against the Company and some of its
current and former executive officers. The lawsuits allege that
the defendants violated Sections10b and 20a of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule10b-5 promulgated
thereunder, by issuing false and misleading financial results to
the market during different class periods ranging from
May3, 2001 to July10, 2002, thereby artificially
inflating the price of the Companys stock. The lawsuits
generally claim that the Company issued false and misleading
statements regarding the Companys earnings prospects and
sales figures, its operations in Russia and the earnings and
sales of its Photonics division. The plaintiffs generally seek
to recover compensatory damages, including interest. The actions
filed in the Eastern District of NewYork and the District
of New Jersey have been transferred to the Central District of
California by stipulation of the parties. The parties to all of
the class actions pending in the Central District of California
have filed an Initial Case Management Order seeking to have all
related actions consolidated before the Honorable David O.
Carter. The Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs 69 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued consolidated amended complaint on August29,
2003, which the Court granted in January 2004. The plaintiffs
filed a second amended consolidated complaint in February 2004.
The Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs second
amended consolidated complaint on March8, 2004. On May9, 2003, a bondholder filed a class
action lawsuit in Orange County Superior Court against the
Company and some of its current and former directors and
executive officers. The lawsuit alleges that defendants violated
Sections11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 by making
false and misleading statements in connection with an offering
of Convertible Subordinated Notes in November 2001, thereby
artificially inflating the market price of the Notes. The
plaintiffs generally seek to recover compensatory damages,
including interest. The Company removed this action to federal
court, and the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on
December17, 2003. The Company filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint, and a hearing on that motion is currently
scheduled for April5, 2004. Generic Litigation:
Three generic pharmaceutical companies, Geneva Pharmaceuticals
Technology Corporation, which merged into its parent Geneva
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Geneva, Three Rivers
Pharmaceuticals, LLC Three Rivers and Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA,Inc. Teva, filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications ANDA with the
FDA to market generic forms of ribavirin for use as part of a
combination therapy for the treatment of hepatitisC. The
Company sued all three of these pharmaceutical companies to
prevent them from marketing a generic form of ribavirin in the
United States market. The three cases were all before the same
judge, and summary judgment motions were filed by the
defendants. In July 2003, the U.S.District Court for the
Central District of California issued a memorandum of decision
and order granting the defendants their motion for summary
judgment of non-infringement of the asserted patents in the
patent infringement suit brought by the Company. The decision
and order did not rule on defendants motion for summary
judgment that patents are invalid. This ruling permits the FDA
to approve the defendant generic companies ANDAs, in their
discretion. On July17, 2003, the Company filed a
Citizens Petition with the FDA requesting that the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs refrain from approving ANDA for
ribavirin products with labeling that omits information about
the products use in combination with PEG-Intron
peginterferon alfa-2b. Action by the FDA on the Citizens
Petition is pending. The successful entry of any generic
pharmaceutical company into the U.S.market will have a
material negative impact on the Companys future
U.S.royalty revenue. On August11, 2003, the District
Court ordered entry of judgment dismissing the action against
Teva and Three Rivers based on its July decision. On
September10, 2003, the Company filed notices of appeal
with respect to these judgments. The District Court also entered
an order on October14, 2003 certifying its July 2003
decision as a final appealable decision with respect Geneva, and
on October16, 2003, the Company filed a notice of appeal
of the July decision in the Geneva actions. On October28,
2003, the Federal Circuit consolidated the Geneva, Teva, and
Three Rivers appeals. The Company filed its initial brief on
December29, 2003, and opposing briefs were filed on
February20, 2004. Patents: Various
parties are opposing the Companys ribavirin patents in
actions before the European Patent Office, and the Company is
responding to these oppositions. Regardless of the outcome of
these oppositions, the Company believes the combination
therapies marketed by Schering and Roche will continue to
benefit from a period of data and marketing protection in the
major markets of the European Union until 2009 for Schering and
2012 for Roche. Yugoslavia: In March
1999, arbitration was initiated in the following matters before
the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of
Arbitration: aState Health Fund of Serbiav. ICN
Pharmaceuticals,Inc., Case No10 373/ AMW/ BDW, and
bICN Pharmaceuticals,Inc.v. Federal Republic
of Yogoslavia and Republic of Serbia, Case No10 439/ BWD.
At issue in these matters is the parties respective
ownership percentages in ICN Yugoslavia, a joint venture formed
by the parties purported predecessors-in-interest in 1990. In these proceedings, the Company has asserted
claims and counterclaims against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia for unlawful expropriation
of its majority interest in the joint 70 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued venture, failure to pay obligations in excess of
$176,000,000, violation of a contractual right of first refusal
regarding the minority owners sale of its interest, and
failure to return the Companys contributed intangible
assets following partial appropriation of the Companys
majority interest. The State Health Fund of Serbia has asserted
a claim against the Company for breach of the joint venture
agreement based on the Companys alleged failure to
contribute certain intangible assets and alleged mismanagement. The arbitration hearings in this matter began in
November 2002 and the Tribunal has scheduled additional hearings
for March 2004. Circe: The former
shareholders the Circe Shareholders of Circe
Biomedical,Inc. Circe filed in July 2003 a
demand for arbitration claiming indemnification from the Company
for approximately $10,000,000 of purported financial losses,
based on provisions of an agreement entered into at the time the
Company acquired Circe. The Circe Stockholders claim to have
suffered such losses as a result of the Companys alleged
breach of its obligations to register for resale the Company
shares issued to the Circe Stockholders as part of the purchase
price for the Circe acquisition. The parties have selected an
arbitrator, and the arbitration hearing is scheduled for
May3-7, 2004. The Company intends to vigorously defend
against the claim. Russia: The Company
is involved in various legal proceedings relating to its
distribution company in Russia. These proceedings arise out of a
claim relating to non-payment under a contract entered into in
January 1995, prior to the Companys acquisition of the
Russian distribution company. The claimant, Minnex Trading
Corporation Minnex in July 2001 initiated
bankruptcy proceedings against OAO Pharmsnabsbyt
PSS, the Companys Russian distribution
company, in the Arbitration Court of Moscow Region, and seeks to
recover $6,200,000 in damages, plus expenses. Certain other
Valeant affiliates are also creditors of PSS, and have asserted
claims in bankruptcy in excess of $12,000,000. Claims have also
been made that the Company is responsible for PSSs
bankruptcy. Under certain circumstances, Russian law imposes
liability on a company whose actions create liabilities or cause
bankruptcy for its Russian subsidiary. The Company intends to
vigorously assert its interests in this matter. Other: The Company
has also identified potential violations of the U.S.Asset
Control Regulations by its subsidiaries with respect to certain
business transactions. The Company submitted a voluntary
disclosure of the potential violations to the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, and reached an agreement to settle the matter in
March 2004. The Company is a party to other pending lawsuits or
subject to a number of threatened lawsuits. While the ultimate
outcome of pending and threatened lawsuits or pending violations
cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable outcome
could have a negative impact on the Company, at this time in the
opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these matters
will not have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

ICN Yugoslavia On February6, 1999, the government of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, acting through the Federal
Ministry of Health and/or the Ministry of Health of Serbia,
seized control of the Companys 75% owned
subsidiary,ICN Yugoslavia. This action, based on a
decision by the Ministry for Economic and Property
Transformation that was reached on November26, 1998,
effectively reduced the Companys equity ownership of ICN
Yugoslavia from 75% to 35%. The Ministry of Economic and
Property Transformation decision was based on the unilaterally
imposed recalculation of the Companys original capital
contribution to ICN Yugoslavia. Subsequent to the seizure, the
Commercial Court of Belgrade issued an order stating that a
change in control had occurred. These actions were taken,
contrary to Yugoslavian law, without any notification to or
representation by the Company. As a result, the Company had and
continues to have no effective control over the operating and
financial affairs of ICN Yugoslavia. Accordingly, the Company
deconsolidated the financial statements of ICN Yugoslavia as of
November26, 1998 and reduced the carrying value of the
Companys investment in ICN Yugoslavia to its fair value,
estimated to be zero. The Company did not recognize any income
or expense related to its investment in Yugoslavia in 2003, 2002
and 2001. See Note13.

License Agreements Schering-Plough: In
1995, the Company entered into an exclusive license and supply
agreement with Schering-Plough the License
Agreement. Under the License Agreement, Schering-Plough
licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the treatment of
chronic hepatitisC. The FDA granted Schering-Plough
marketing approval for Rebetol capsules
Schering-Ploughs brand name for ribavirin as a
separately marketed product for use only in combination with
Intron A injection for the treatment of hepatitisC in
patients with compensated liver disease previously untreated
with alfa interferon commonly referred to as
treatment-nave patients or who have relapsed following
alfa interferon therapy. The FDA also granted Schering-Plough
approval for Peg-IntronTM peginterferon alfa-2b, a
longer lasting form of Intron A, for use in Combination Therapy
with Rebetol for the treatment of chronic hepatitisC in
patients with compensated liver disease who 74 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued are at least 18years of age.
Schering-Plough markets the Combination Therapy in the United
States, Europe, Japan, and many other countries around the world
based on the U.S. and European Union regulatory approvals. In November 2000, the Company entered into an
agreement that provides Schering-Plough with certain rights to
license various products the Company may develop. Under the
terms of the agreement, Schering-Plough has the option to
exclusively license on a worldwide basis up to three compounds
that the Company may develop for the treatment of
hepatitisC on terms specified in the agreement. The option
does not apply to LevovirinTM or
ViramidineTM. The option is exercisable as to a
particular compound at any time prior to the start of
PhaseII clinical studies for that compound. Once it
exercises the option with respect to a compound, Schering-Plough
is required to take over all developmental costs and
responsibility for regulatory approval for that compound. Under
the agreement, the Company would receive royalty revenues based
on the sales of licensed products. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company
also granted Schering-Plough and an affiliate rights of
first/last refusal to license compounds relating to the
treatment of infectious diseases other than hepatitisC
or cancer or other oncology indications as well as rights of
first/last refusal with respect to LevovirinTM and
ViramidineTM collectively, the Refusal
Rights. Under the terms of the Refusal Rights, if the
Company intends to offer a license or other rights with respect
to any of these compounds to a third party, the Company is
required to notify Schering-Plough. At Schering-Ploughs
request, the Company is required to negotiate in good faith with
Schering-Plough on an exclusive basis the terms of a mutually
acceptable exclusive worldwide license or other form of
agreement on commercial terms to be mutually agreed upon. If the
Company cannot reach an agreement with Schering-Plough, the
Company is permitted to negotiate a license agreement or other
arrangement with a third party. Prior to entering into any final
arrangement with the third party, the Company is required to
offer substantially similar terms to Schering-Plough, which
terms Schering-Plough has the right to match. If Schering-Plough does not exercise its option
or Refusal Rights as to a particular compound, the Company may
continue to develop that compound or license that compound to
other third parties. The agreement with Schering-Plough will
terminate the later of 12years from the date of the
agreement or the termination of the 1995 license agreement with
Schering-Plough. The agreement was entered into as part of the
resolution of claims asserted by Schering-Plough against the
Company, including claims regarding the Companys alleged
improper hiring of former Schering-Plough research and
development personnel and claims that the Company was not
permitted to conduct hepatitisC research. Roche: On
January6, 2003, the Company entered into a license
agreement with Roche the Roche License Agreement
which authorizes Roche to make, have made and to sell its own
version of ribavirin, known as Copegus, under the Companys
patents for use in combination therapy with Roches version
of pegylated interferon, known as Pegasys, for the treatment of
hepatitisC. Under the Roche License Agreement, Roche will
register and commercialize Copegus globally. Roche will pay
royalty fees to the Company on its sales of the combination
product containing Copegus. The successful entry of any generic
pharmaceutical company into the U.S.market for the sale of
oral ribavirin will result in the cessation of future
U.S.royalty revenue from Roche and a likely reduction in
the effective royalty rate from Schering-Plough. 75 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS

Subsequent Events Acquisition of Amarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.:
In February 2004, the Company acquired
from Amarin Corporation, plc its U.S.-based subsidiary, Amarin
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and all of its U.S.products. Under
the terms of the transaction, the Company paid $38,000,000 in
cash at the closing for the rights to Amarins product
portfolio, which includes Permax and a primary care
portfolio with a broad range of indications. The Company also
acquired in the transaction the rights to Zelapar, a
late-stage candidate for the treatment of Parkinsons
disease. Amarin has received an approvable letter from the FDA
for Zelapar, subject to the completion of two safety studies,
which Amarin will fund and expects to complete in 2004. The
agreement calls for the Company to make additional milestone
payments of up to $8,000,000 to Amarin based on the successful
completion of the studies and final approval by the FDA of
Zelapar. In addition, the Company will make a milestone payment
of $10,000,000 to the developer of Zelapar upon the attainment
of specified sales thresholds. Interest Rate Swap Agreement on 7% Notes:
In January 2004, the Company entered
into an interest rate swap agreement with respect to
$150,000,000 principal amount of the 70% Notes, with the
objective of 83 Table of Contents VALEANT PHARMACEUTICALS
INTERNATIONAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued reducing interest costs. The agreement provides
that the Company will exchange its 7% fixed-rate payment
obligation for variable rate payments of six-month LIBOR plus
2409%. While the objective of the swap is to reduce the
Companys overall interest cost, if LIBOR rates increase
over 459%, our cost of debt will equal or exceed the current
fixed rate amount subject to the swap. The swaps have terms
expiring at the maturity of the debt. The swap arrangements are
with different counterparties than the holders of the underlying
debt. Management believes that any credit risk associated with
the swaps is remote based on the creditworthiness of the
financial institutions issuing the swaps. Other: In March
2004, the Company entered into Euro denominated forward
contracts totaling
46,300,000,
in an effort to reduce its monetary exposure due to variability
in the Euro. 84 Table of Contents SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND

Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed in the Companys Exchange Act reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and
evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives, and management
necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 31, 2003, the Company conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. This
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer. Based upon the foregoing, the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective
in making known to them material information relating to the
Company including its consolidated subsidiaries required to be
included in this report. There has been no significant change in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting, known
to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer,
that occurred during the quarter ended December31, 2003
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting. 85 Table of Contents PART III
