Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors QLogic Corporation We have audited the consolidated financial
statements of QLogic Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in
a1. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
financial statement schedule as listed in a2.
These consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and the financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of QLogic Corporation and
subsidiaries as of March28, 2004 and March30, 2003,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended March28,
2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion,
the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets as of
April1, 2002. KPMG LLP Orange County, California April28, 2004, except as to the third paragraph of

Note1.
Description of Business and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies   
General Business Information QLogic Corporation QLogic or the Company
designs and supplies semiconductor and board level input/output
I/ O products, full fabric switches, and enclosure management
semiconductors. The Companys I/ O products provide a high
performance interface between computer systems and their
attached data storage peripherals, such as hard disk drives,
tape drives, removable disk drives and redundant array of
independent disks subsystems, or RAID subsystems. The Company
markets and distributes its products through a direct sales
organization supported by field application engineers, as well
as through a network of independent manufacturers
representatives and regional and international distributors. The
Companys primary original equipment manufacturer
OEMcustomers are major domestic and international
suppliers and manufacturers of servers, workstations and data
storage peripherals.   
Principles of Consolidation and Financial
Reporting Period The consolidated financial statements include the
financial statements of QLogic Corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company maintains a fifty-two/fifty-three
week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest March31.
Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 each comprised fifty-two weeks
and ended on March28, 2004, March30, 2003 and
March31, 2002, respectively.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
that affect the amounts reported in the Companys
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.   
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales
when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to
the customer. The customers obligation to pay, and the
payment terms, are set at the time of shipment and are not
dependent on subsequent resale of the Companys product.
However, certain of the Companys sales are made to
distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right to
return unsold product. The Company recognizes revenue from these
distributors when the product is sold by the distributor to a
third party. Royalty and service revenue is recognized when
earned and receipt is assured.   
Research and Development Research and development costs, including costs
related to the development of new products and process
technology, as well as acquired in-process technology, are
expensed as incurred.   
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period 35 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued that includes the enactment date. A valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized.   
Net Income per Share The Company computes basic net income per share
based on the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted net income per
share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common
and dilutive potential common shares outstanding using the
treasury stock method during the periods presented. The Company
has granted certain stock options and warrants which have been
treated as dilutive potential common shares in computing diluted
net income per share.   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash equivalents, investments in marketable
securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company invests
its marketable securities primarily in municipal bonds,
corporate bonds and government securities, all of which are high
investment grade. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly
rated securities. Sales to customers are denominated in
U.S.dollars. As a result, the Company believes its foreign
currency risk is minimal. The Company sells its products to OEMs and
distributors throughout the world. As of March28, 2004 and
March30, 2003, the Company had three and two customers,
respectively, which individually accounted for 10% or more of
the Companys accounts receivable. Such customers accounted
for an aggregate of 40% and 29% of the Companys accounts
receivable at March28, 2004 and March30, 2003. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and, generally, requires no
collateral from its customers.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the consolidated statements of
cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments
purchased with original maturities of three months or less on
their acquisition date to be cash equivalents. The carrying
amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair
values.   
Marketable Securities and
Investments The Companys marketable securities are
invested primarily in debt securities, including municipal
bonds, corporate bonds and government securities. All of the
Companys marketable securities are classified as available
for sale and are recorded at fair value, based on quoted market
prices. The Companys available-for-sale marketable
securities are included in short-term investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, net of related income taxes, are excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive
income until realized. Realized gains or losses and other than
temporary declines in fair value are determined on a specific
identification basis and reported in other income and expense as
incurred. Net realized gains on marketable securities are
included in interest and other income in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income and aggregated
$11million, $42million and $08million in
fiscal year 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Non-marketable investments, where the Company is
unable to exercise significant influence over the investee, are
accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method,
investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for
other-than-temporary declines in fair value, distributions of
earnings or additional investments. During fiscal 2003, the Company recorded charges
of $40million to write down the carrying value of certain
non-marketable investments to their estimated fair value of
zero. These investments consisted of equity 36 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued interests in early stage technology companies
which the Company had accounted for under the cost method.
Management estimated the fair value of these investments based
upon available financial and other information, including
then-current and projected business prospects for the subject
companies, and determined that the decline in the fair value of
these investments was other than temporary.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
first-in, first-out or net realizable value.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of 395years for buildings, five to
fifteen years for building and land improvements, and two to
five years for equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or
the estimated useful life of the related asset.   
Goodwill and Intangible
Assets On April1, 2002, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. SFAS142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite lives not be amortized
but rather be tested at least annually for impairment, or more
frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the asset might be impaired. The following table presents the impact of
SFAS142 on net income and net income per share had
SFAS142 been in effect for all periods presented

The adjusted net income and related per share
amounts do not reflect an adjustment for the income tax effect
related to the amortization of goodwill, since no income tax
benefit was recorded in connection with the goodwill
amortization included in the Companys consolidated
financial statements.   
Impairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived
Assets In accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo142, goodwill is tested for impairment at the
reporting unit level annually and in interim periods if certain
events occur indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill
may be impaired. The two-step impairment test is used to
identify potential goodwill impairments and to measure the
amount of any goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. During
the first step of the impairment analysis, the fair value of the
reporting unit as defined by SFASNo142 is
compared to its net book value. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the
goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of
any impairment loss. 37 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The Company performs the annual test for
impairment as of the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter and
utilizes the two-step process. As part of the first step, the
Company determined that it has one reporting unit for purposes
of performing the fair-value based test of goodwill. During the
annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2004, the Company
completed step one and determined that there was no impairment
of goodwill since the fair value based on quoted market price
of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Long-lived assets, including other purchased
intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell.   
Warranty The Companys products typically carry a
warranty for periods of one to five years. The Company records a
liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale
based on historical warranty experience. Warranty expense is not
material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes all changes in
equity other than transactions with stockholders. The
Companys accumulated other comprehensive income consists
of unrealized gains on the available-for-sale securities, net of
income taxes.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its employee stock-based
compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB25 and related interpretations,
rather than the alternative fair value accounting allowed by
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation. APB25 provides that compensation
expense relative to the Companys stock-based employee
compensation plans including shares issued under the
Companys stock option and employee stock purchase plans,
collectively the Options is measured based on the
intrinsic value of stock options granted and the Company
recognizes compensation expense in its statements of income
using the straight-line method over the vesting period for fixed
awards. Under SFAS123, the fair value of Options at the
date of grant is recognized in earnings over the vesting period.
In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBissued SFAS148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure. SFAS148 amends SFAS123 to provide
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS148 amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS123 to require prominent disclosures
in both annual and interim financial statements about the method
of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the
effect of the method on reported results. The Company adopted
the disclosure provisions of SFAS148 as of March30,
2003 and continues to follow APB25 for stock-based
employee compensation. 38 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The following table shows pro forma net income as

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that
have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including expected stock price
volatility. Because the Companys Options have
characteristics significantly different than those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the estimate, in managements
opinion, the existing models do not provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Companys Options.   
Performance-Based Warrants Warrants granted in connection with sales
transactions are accounted for at their fair value, using the
Black-Scholes valuation model, in the period earned in
accordance with the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue No96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services. The warrants are recorded as stock-based sales
discounts and presented as a reduction to gross revenues in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. 39 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the current year presentation. Note2.Acquisitions and
Dispositions   
Little Mountain Group, Inc. On January23, 2001, the Company acquired
the outstanding common stock of Little Mountain Group, Inc.
LMG, for cash, stock and additional consideration related to
performance milestones which could aggregate up to
$30million over a four-year period. LMG is a designer of
iSCSI silicon and board level products to enable an Ethernet
Storage Area Network. The Company accounted for the transaction
as a purchase. Accordingly, the excess purchase price paid over
the fair value of the LMG net assets acquired of
$57million was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill was
being amortized over five years until the adoption of
SFAS142 in fiscal 2003. The structure of the acquisition
includes payments of stock based on performance milestones to be
achieved over the next four fiscal years. These payments will be
charged to engineering and development expense as the
performance milestones are achieved. During fiscal 2004, 2003
and 2002, the Company issued approximately 131,000, 109,000 and
41,000shares of common stock in connection with the
achievement of the performance milestones. The fair value of the
shares issued in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$65million, $44million and $22million,
respectively. At March28, 2004, a performance payment to
the former stockholders of LMG of $12million was included
in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.   
Silicon Design Resources,
Inc. On August20, 1998, the Company acquired the
net assets of Silicon Design Resources, Inc. SDRfor
$2million in cash. In addition, the Company was obligated
to pay up to an additional $8million in cash provided that
certain performance targets were achieved through fiscal year
2002. These payments were accounted for as additional purchase
price and allocated to the intangible assets acquired,
specifically the in-process technology and the completed
technology. During fiscal year 2002, the Company recorded the
final performance payment to the former stockholders of SDR of
$17million, which was comprised of $11million
written-off as acquired in-process technology and
$06million was capitalized as completed technology. Adaptive RAID
Technology On February26, 2001, the Company sold its
Adaptive RAID technology to Yotta Yotta, Inc. in exchange for a
$75million note receivable. The note was immediately
payable upon completion of Yotta Yotta, Inc.s qualified
financing, or at the notes maturity in January 2004. Due
to the uncertainty regarding collection of the note, the Company
deferred the gain from the sale of this technology until the
collection of the note receivable from Yotta Yotta, Inc. In September 2003, the Company and Yotta Yotta
amended the purchase agreement and the original consideration
consisting of the $75million note receivable was
substituted with a future royalty arrangement. Under the amended
agreement, Yotta Yotta is required to pay future royalties on
certain of its products for ten years or until all amounts
previously owed to the Company pursuant to the original
agreement are repaid. During fiscal 2004, royalty revenues
recognized by the Company were immaterial. Note3.Net Income per

Stockholders Equity   
Capital Stock The Companys authorized capital consists of
1million shares of preferred stock, par value
$0001per share, and 500million shares of common
stock, par value $0001per share. The preferred stock, of
which no shares have been issued, includes 200,000shares
designated as SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred Stock
SeriesA Preferred Stock. As of March28, 2004 and
March30, 2003, the Company had 954million and
939million shares of common stock issued, respectively.
At March28, 2004, 175million shares of common stock
were reserved for the exercise of issued and unissued common
stock options and 19million shares were reserved for
issuance in connection with the Companys Employee Stock
Purchase Plan.   
Treasury Stock In October 2002, the Companys Board of
Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes
the Company to repurchase up to $100million of the
Companys outstanding common stock for a two-year period.
During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Company purchased treasury
stock totaling $570million and $30million,
respectively. As of March28, 2004, the Company had
purchased 13million shares of treasury stock under the
stock repurchase program. The shares repurchased have been taken
in as treasury shares and will be held as treasury shares until
the Companys Board of Directors designates that these
shares be retired or used for some other purpose. During April and May 2004, the Company purchased
an additional 14million shares of common stock under the
stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of
$400million. With these purchases of common stock, the
Company has repurchased the entire amount authorized pursuant to
the program. Stockholder
Rights Plan On June4, 1996, the Board of Directors of
the Company unanimously adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan the
Rights Plan pursuant to which it declared a dividend
distribution of preferred stock purchase rights a Right upon
all of the outstanding shares of the common stock. The Rights dividend was paid on June20,
1996 to the holders of record of shares of common stock on that
date, at the rate of one-eighth of one whole Right per one share
of common stock, as adjusted pursuant to the Companys
stock splits. Each share of common stock presently outstanding
that had been issued since 43 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued June20, 1996 also includes one-eighth
Right, and each share of common stock that may be issued after
the date hereof and prior to the Distribution Date as defined
below also will include one-eighth Right. The Rights become exercisable ithe 10th
business day following the date of a public announcement that a
person or a group of affiliated or associated persons an
Acquiring Person has acquired beneficial ownership of 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of common stock, or iithe
10th business day following the commencement of, or announcement
of an intention to make a tender offer or exchange offer the
consummation of which would result in the person or group making
the offer becoming an Acquiring Person the earlier of the dates
described in clausesi and ii being called the
Distribution Date. The Rights held by an Acquiring Person or its
affiliates are not exercisable. All shares of common stock that
will be issued prior to the Distribution Date will include such
Rights. The Rights will expire at the close of business on
June4, 2006 the Scheduled Expiration Date, unless prior
thereto the Distribution Date occurs, or unless the Scheduled
Expiration Date is extended. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, as amended to date,
each Right entitles the registered holder, on and after the
Distribution Date and until redemption of all Rights, to
purchase from the Company 1/100th of one whole share a Unit of
the Companys SeriesA Preferred Stock. The purchase
price is $42500per Unit. In the event of certain
acquisitions involving the Acquiring Person, directly or
indirectly, the holder of each Right will be entitled to
purchase for $42500 certain shares or assets of the Company or
an Acquiring Person that have a market value of $85000 at such
time. The Company has 200,000 whole shares of
SeriesA Preferred Stock authorized 40,000,000 Units
authorized, of which no shares or Units are issued or
outstanding at March28, 2004. Each Unit would entitle the
holder to Aone vote, voting together with the shares of
common stock; Bin the event the Companys assets
are liquidated, a payment of one dollar $100 or an amount
equal to the payment to be distributed per share of common
stock, whichever is greater; and Cin the event of any
merger, consolidation or other transaction in which shares of
common stock are exchanged, a payment in an amount equal to the
payment received per share of common stock. The number of Rights
per share of common stock, and the purchase price, is subject to
adjustment in the event of each and any stock split, stock
dividend or similar event.   
Note8.
Stock Plans   
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the ESPP that operates in accordance with Section423 of
the Internal Revenue Code. The ESPP is administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the
ESPP, employees of the Company who elect to participate are
granted options to purchase common stock at a 15% discount from
the lower of the market value of the common stock at the
beginning or end of each three-month offering period. The ESPP
permits an enrolled employee to make contributions to purchase
shares of common stock by having withheld from their salary an
amount between 1% and 10% of compensation. As of March28,
2004 and March30, 2003, ESPP participant contributions of
$08million and $05million, respectively, were
included in other current liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The total number of shares issued
under the ESPP was 136,000, 121,000 and 104,000 during fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   
Incentive Compensation Plans On January12, 1994, the Companys
Board of Directors adopted the QLogic Corporation Stock Awards
Plan the Stock Awards Plan and the QLogic Corporation
Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director Plan
collectively, the Stock Option Plans. Additionally, the
Company has issued options on an ad hoc basis from time to time. 44 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued The Stock Awards Plan provides for the issuance
of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock
and other stock-based incentive awards for officers and key
employees. The Stock Awards Plan permits the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors to select eligible employees
to receive awards and to determine the terms and conditions of
awards. No shares of restricted stock have been issued under the
Stock Awards Plan. Options granted under the Companys Stock
Awards Plan provide that an employee holding a stock option may
exchange mature stock, which the employee already owns, as
payment against the exercise of an option. This provision
applies to all options outstanding as of March28, 2004.
All stock options granted under the Companys Stock Awards
Plan have ten-year terms and vest over four years from the date
of grant. Under the terms of the Director Plan, new
directors receive an option grant, at fair market value, to
purchase40,000shares of common stock of the Company
upon election to the Board, and the plan provides for annual
grants to each non-employee director other than the Chairman of
the Board of options to purchase20,000shares of
common stock. The plan also provides for annual grants of
options to purchase54,000shares of common stock to
any non-employee Chairman of the Board. All stock options
granted under the Director Plan have ten-year terms and vest
over three years from the date of grant. As of March28, 2004, options to
purchase116million shares and 616,000shares
of common stock were held by employees and directors,
respectively. Shares available for future grant aggregated
47million and 565,000 under the Stock Awards Plan and the
Director Plan, respectively. In addition, options granted in fiscal 1995
outside of the Companys Stock Option Plans to purchase an
additional 30,000shares of common stock were outstanding
as of March28, 2004. These options had four-year vesting
terms and have a ten-year expiration date. Warrants As part of an agreement with Sun Microsystems,
Inc. Sun, the Company granted a warrant to Sun to purchase a
certain number of shares of the Companys common stock
based upon the volume of revenue received from Sun. The warrant
shares were earned at the rate of one share for each $12700 of
switch product revenue the Company received from Sun through
September30, 2002. In each period in which the warrant
shares were earned, a non-cash sales discount was recorded. The
amount of the non-cash sales discount was the fair value of the
warrant shares, which were earned in the period. The fair value
of the warrant shares was calculated by using the Black-Scholes
valuation model. The assumptions used in the fair value
calculation of the warrant shares were generally consistent with
those assumptions used in computing the Companys
stock-based compensation pro forma disclosures see
Note1, except as to the term of the warrants, which was
the contractual term. In connection with this agreement, the
Company issued warrants to purchase390,000shares of
its common stock with an exercise price of $1384per
share. As of March30, 2003, all of warrants were
outstanding. In January 2004, the warrant holder, using a
cashless exercise feature pursuant to the original agreement,
exercised the warrants and the Company issued
280,000shares of common stock in full settlement of its
obligation under the warrants. 45 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Litigation In January 2003, Raytheon Company filed suit in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas, alleging that the Company, along with seven other
defendants, infringe a Raytheon patent directed to a mass data
storage system. The suit sought injunctive relief and damages in
an unspecified amount. The Company filed an answer to the
complaint in March 2003 and trial was scheduled to begin in
September 2004. In February 2004, the Company settled the
lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, the lawsuit was
dismissed, Raytheon licensed three patents to the Company
including the patent in dispute, and the Company paid Raytheon
a one-time license fee, which was recorded in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2004. The license fee was not material to the
Companys financial position or results of operations. In February 2003, Vixel Corporation filed suit in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
the First Delaware Action alleging infringement of
a Vixel patent directed to a method and apparatus for Fibre
Channel interconnection of private loop devices. In March 2003,
Vixel amended its complaint to add two additional Vixel patents.
These additional patents are directed to substantially the same
technology as the original Vixel patent. The suit seeks
injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. The
Company filed an answer to the complaint in April 2003 denying
all allegations. The suit is in its very early stages and
discovery has commenced. The Company disputes the
plaintiffs claims in the First Delaware Action and intends
to defend this lawsuit vigorously. In December 2003, the Company filed suit against
Emulex the new parent company of Vixel in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California the
California Action alleging that Emulex infringes
one of the Companys patents related to a digital switch
element used in Fibre Channel systems. The suit seeks
unspecified monetary damages as well as injunctive relief. During December 2003, the Company and Emulex
engaged in negotiations to settle the First Delaware Action and
the California Action. As a result of those discussions, the
parties signed a document entitled terms of
agreement which the parties intended would outline the
basis for a settlement agreement. During January and February
2004, the parties attempted to negotiate a settlement agreement
based on the previously discussed outline and to date have not
been successful in such efforts. In late February 2004, Emulex
filed suit in the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware the Second Delaware Action asking the
Delaware court for declaratory relief that: ithe patent
in dispute in the California Action is invalid and, if 47 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued the patent is valid, then Emulex does not
infringe the patent; and iithe terms of
agreement is a final and binding settlement of the First
Delaware Action and the California Action. This suit is in the
very early stages. The Company disputes the plaintiffs
claims in the Second Delaware Action and intends to defend this
lawsuit vigorously. During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the
Company accrued estimated settlement costs aggregating
$175million associated with the legal claims for
ia dispute with a former customer, and iithe
First Delaware Action and the California Action. The Company has
paid the accrued settlement to the former customer and the
parties have mutually released each other from all liability
associated with their claims. Although the First Delaware Action
and the California Action are still ongoing, management believes
the accrued settlement costs will be consistent with any
settlement payment due upon the final resolution of these
matters. Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have
been or may be instituted against the Company, including the
matters discussed above. The outcome of litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims and
proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Many
intellectual property disputes have a risk of injunctive relief
and there can be no assurance that a license will be granted.
Injunctive relief could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial condition or results of operations. The
Company is unable to estimate the range of possible loss from
any outstanding litigation, except as described above. However,
based on an evaluation of matters which are pending or asserted,
management believes the disposition of such matters will not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
condition or results of operations.

Based upon the Companys current and
historical pre-tax earnings, management believes it is more
likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of the
existing net deferred tax assets as of March28, 2004.
Management believes the existing net deductible temporary
differences will reverse during periods in which the Company
generates net taxable income or that there would be sufficient
tax carry backs available; however, there can be no assurance
that the Company will generate any earnings or any specific
level of continuing earnings in future years. 49 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued As of March28, 2004, the Company has
federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$125million and aggregate state net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $87million. The federal
net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates between
2011 and 2020. The aggregate state net operating loss
carryforwards expire on various dates between 2006 and 2015. All
net operating loss carryforwards relate to acquired companies
and are subject to limitations on their utilization. As of March28, 2004, the Company has state
tax credit carryforwards of approximately $11million. If
not utilized, the state tax credit carryforwards will begin to
expire in 2014. Approximately $03million of the state tax
credits carryforwards relate to acquired companies and are
subject to limitations on their utilization. The Companys U.S.income tax returns
for the 2001 and 2002 fiscal years are presently under review by
the Internal Revenue Service. Management does not expect a
material impact on the consolidated financial statements from
this examination.

Controls and Procedures As of the end of the quarter ended March28,
2004, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined in Rule13a-15e promulgated under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of March28, 2004 to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that are
filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms. There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting during our quarter ended
March28, 2004 that materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. PARTIII
