51 Table of Contents Independent Auditors Report The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Consolidated Water Co. Ltd We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December
31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of Consolidated Water Co.
Ltd.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated April15, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting. s/ KPMG George Town, Cayman Islands

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 56 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Principal activity Consolidated Water Co. Ltd., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned subsidiary and affiliate
together the Company use reverse osmosis technology to produce fresh water from seawater. The
Company processes and supplies water to its customers in the Cayman Islands, Belize, Bahamas,
Barbados and British Virgin Islands. The Company sells water to a variety of customers, including
public utilities, commercial and tourist properties, residential properties and government
facilities. The base price of water supplied by the Company, and adjustments thereto, are
generally determined by the terms of the license and contracts, which provide for adjustments based
upon the movement in the government price indices specified in the license and contracts, as well
as monthly adjustments for changes in the cost of energy. The Company also provides consulting
services under long-term agreements under which the Company designs and constructs desalination
plants, and manages and operates plants owned by other companies. 2. Accounting policies Basis of preparation: The consolidated financial statements presented are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Use of estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, allowances for receivables and inventory. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Basis of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries Cayman Water Company Limited, Belize Water Limited, Ocean
Conversion Cayman Limited, DesalCo Limited, DesalCo Barbados Ltd, and its majority owned
subsidiary Waterfields Company Limited. The operating results of Ocean Conversion Cayman
Limited, DesalCo Limited, DesalCo Barbados Ltd. have been included in the consolidated financial
statements effective February1, 2003. The operating results of Waterfields Company Limited have
been included in the financial statements effective August1, 2003. All inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Foreign currency: The Companys reporting currency is the United States dollar. The functional
currency of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries is the currency for each respective country.
The exchange rates between the Cayman Islands dollar, the Belize dollar, the Bahamian dollar and
the Barbados dollar have been fixed to the United States dollar during all periods presented. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the
rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Net exchange gains and losses are included in other
income in the consolidated statements of income. Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at banks on call and highly
liquid deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 57 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued Trade accounts receivable: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts based on
meter readings. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount
of probable credit losses in the Companys existing accounts receivable balance. The Company
determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical write-off experience and monthly
review of delinquent accounts. Past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility and
disconnection. Account balances are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts after
all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered by
management to be remote. Inventory: Inventory primarily includes replacement spares and parts that are valued at the lower
of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory also includes potable
water held in the Companys reservoirs. The carrying amount of the water inventory is the lower of
the average cost of producing or purchasing water during the year and its net realizable value. Loans receivable: Loans receivable relate to amounts advanced to customers to facilitate the
construction of water desalination plants. The allowance for loan losses, if any, is the Companys
best estimate of the amount of potable credit losses in the Companys existing loans and is
determined on an individual loan basis. Management believes the loans receivable are collectible
and, therefore, no loan allowance has been established as of December31, 2004. Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using a straight line method with an allowance for
estimated residual values. Rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows   
Buildings
5 to 40 years   Plant and equipment
4 to 40 years   Distribution system
3 to 40 years   Office furniture, fixtures and equipment
3 to 10 years   Vehicles
3 to 10 years   Leasehold improvements
Shorter of 5 years or operating lease term outstanding   Lab Equipment
5 to 10 years Additions to property, plant and equipment are comprised of the cost of the contracted services,
direct labour and materials. Assets under construction are recorded as additions to property,
plant and equipment upon completion of the projects. Depreciation commences in the month of
addition. Interest costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets,
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to ready for their intended
use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready
for use or sale. 58 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible assets: Goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets
of an acquired business. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination
accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but
are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No142. SFAS
No142 also requires that intangible assets with estimatable useful lives be amortized over their
respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment
in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The
Company periodically evaluates the possible impairment of goodwill. Management identifies its
reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets
and liabilities, including the existing goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units.
The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to the carrying amount
of the reporting unit. To the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair
value of the reporting unit, the Company is required to perform the second step of the impairment
test, as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired. In this step, the
Company compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of
the reporting unit goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the
fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of
the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair
value of the reporting unit goodwill. If the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount,
the impairment loss is recorded. The Companys annual impairment valuation resulted in no goodwill
impairment. Investments: Investments where the Company does not exercise significant influence over the
operating and financial policies of the investee and holds less than 20% of the voting stock are
recorded at cost. Investments where the Company has significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of the investee and holds 20% to 50% of the voting stock are recorded using the
equity method of accounting for investments in common stock. The Company recognizes an impairment
loss on declines in value that are other than temporary. Other assets: Other assets consist of the bank financing fees paid on the drawdown of the Companys
long term debt and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the loans. Other liabilities: Other liabilities consist of security deposits and advances in aid of
construction. Security deposits are received from large customers as security for trade
receivables. Advances in aid of construction are recognized as a liability when advances are
received from condominium developers in the licensed area to help defray the capital expenditure
costs of the Company. These advances do not represent loans to the Company and are interest free.
However, the Company allows a discount of ten percent on future supplies of water to these
developments until the aggregate discounts allowed are equivalent to advances received. Discounts
are charged against advances received. Shares repurchased: Under Cayman Islands law, shares repurchased out of capital by the Company are
treated as cancelled upon redemption, and the Companys issued share capital is reduced by the par
value of those shares, with the difference being adjusted to additional paid up capital. 59 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued Stock and stock option incentive plans: The Company issues stock under incentive plans that form
part of employees and non-executive Directors remuneration. The Company also grants options to
purchase ordinary shares as part of remuneration for certain long-serving employees and certain
management employees. During the year ended December31, 2003, the option plan for certain management employees was
amended as part of renegotiations of employee contracts. The amended contracts terminated the
stock option plans for all years commencing from January1, 2004. The Company applies the intrinsic-value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations to account for its fixed-plan stock options. Under this method, compensation
expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock
exceeds the exercise price. SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation established
accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair-valued-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No123, the Company continues to
apply the intrinsic-value method of accounting described above and has adopted the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No123. The following table illustrates the effect on net income if the
fair-value-based method has been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period.

The intrinsic value of stock based compensation is recorded in stockholders equity and is expensed
to the consolidated statements of income based on the vesting period of the options. On exercise
of options, proceeds up to the par value of the stock issued are credited to ordinary share
capital; any proceeds in excess of the par value of the stock issued are credited to additional
paid in capital in the period in which the options are exercised. Options that expire without
exercise are also credited to additional paid in capital in the period in which the option expired. Revenue and cost of sales: Customers are billed monthly based on meter readings performed at or
near each month end and in accordance with agreements, which stipulate minimum monthly charges for
water service. An accrual, where necessary, is made for water delivered but unbilled at year end
when readings are not performed at the year end date. The accrual is matched with the direct costs
of producing, purchasing and delivering water. Consulting revenue is recognized on the accrual basis based upon time spent at agreed upon rates
and is included under service revenue. Plant construction revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. The recognized
income is that percentage of estimated total income that incurred costs to date bear to estimated
total costs after giving effect to estimates of costs to complete based upon most recent
information. This revenue is included under services revenue. Interest income is recognized by the Company over the term of a loan based on the interest rate
stated in the loan and is included in interest income. 60 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued Repairs and maintenance: All repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Comparative figures: Certain prior year amounts have been adjusted to conform to the current
years presentation. The Company has reallocated various maintenance expenses to cost of sales
from general and administrative expenses. In addition, the Company has adjusted the cost and
amortization of the Belize water production and supply agreement intangible asset to reflect a 2003
revaluation. These adjustments have no impact on the net income of the Company. 3. Acquisitions Effective February1, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding voting common shares of

Significant concentrations of credit risk are disclosed in Note 24. 6. Insurance claim receivable On September11 and 12, 2004, Hurricane Ivan significantly affected the Companys Cayman Islands
operations. As a result, the Company suffered damage to its seawater conversion plants, which are
covered by property insurance. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is
required to record the loss of any property which must be replaced in the period the loss occurs,
and record any gain from related insurance claims only when the recovery is probable. As at December31, 2004, the Company has estimated the total loss to be $2,541,501 consisting of
plant and equipment of $1,351,563, spare parts inventories of $111,839 and $1,078,099 relating to
the rebuilding of the Cayman Islands operations as at December31, 2004. These amounts have been
recorded against the insurance recovery and appear as a gain on the income statement as Net
insurance recovery due to Hurricane Ivan. The Company also suffered loss of profits during the period that it was unable to sell water to its
Cayman Islands customers. The Company has quantified this loss of profits at $818,700 and has been
fully covered in the Companys claim for such loss to its insurer under its Loss of Profits
insurance. The Company has recorded total recoveries from insurance of $3,132,905 offsetting the
total estimated loss of $2,541,501. On February8, 2005, the Company accepted a proposal from the insurance company for a final
settlement sum of $1,932,905 towards claims for loss and damage to property and loss of profits.
This amount has been recorded as a Insurance claim receivable on the December31, 2004 balance
sheet and is part of the gain of $591,404. 63 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7. Inventory

At December31, 2004, the Company had outstanding capital commitments of approximately $780,000
2003: $600,000. It is the Companys policy to maintain adequate insurance for loss or damage to
all fixed assets that in managements assessment may be susceptible to loss. The Company does not
insure its underground distribution system, which originally cost $9,873,746 2003: $9,751,456. 10. Investments in affiliates As part of the acquisition described in Note 3, the Company acquired 50% and 100% of the
outstanding voting common shares and non-voting common shares, respectively, of Ocean Conversion
BVILtd. On May9, 2003, the Company sold 100% of its non-voting shares in Ocean Conversion
BVILtd. to Sage Water Holdings BVILimited for $2,120,250. The Company now owns 50% of the
voting common shares of Ocean Conversion BVILtd., representing a 435% interest in the company. The Companys investment in Ocean Conversion BVILtd. is accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. The excess cost over the Companys share of fair value net assets acquired of Ocean Conversion
BVILtd. is $6,654,362, which is considered equity-method goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No.
142 this equity-method goodwill is not being amortized, but is analyzed for impairment. At
December31, 2004, management believes there is no impairment of this equity-method goodwill. 65 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 10.

11. Intangible assets Effective February1, 2003, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding voting common shares of
DesalCo Limited, its wholly-owned subsidiary DesalCo Barbados Ltd., and Ocean Conversion Cayman
Limited. A portion of the purchase price was allocated to the following identifiable intangible
assets. aAs part of the acquisition of DesalCo Limited the Company originally attributed $726,902 to an
intangible asset which was adjusted in 2004 by $129,454 for a total balance of $856,356. This
represents the fair value of a Management Services Agreement originally dated December4, 2000,
under which DesalCo Limited provides management and engineering services to Ocean Conversion BVI
Ltd. an affiliated company. Original agreement was amended on February7, 2003 such that there is
no expiration term. Management of the Company has determined that this intangible asset has an
indefinite life, and therefore it is not being amortized. 66 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11. Intangible assets continued bAs part of the acquisition of DesalCo Limited, the Company attributed $337,149 to another
intangible asset, the DWEER Distribution Agreement between DesalCo Limited and DWEER Technology
Limited, which expires on October31, 2009. Under this agreement DesalCo Limited was granted an
exclusive right, within certain geographical areas in the Caribbean, Central and South America, to
distribute certain patented equipment which can increase the operational efficiency of reverse
osmosis seawater desalination plants. The estimated fair value attributable to the intangible
asset of the DWEER Distribution Agreement is being amortized over the remaining term of the
seven-year agreement and has a weighted average useful life of 683years. cAs part of the acquisition of DesalCo Limited, the Company attributed $104,050 to an intangible
asset which represents the fair value of an operations agreement between Sandy Lane Properties Ltd.
and DesalCo Barbados Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of DesalCo Limited. Under the terms of
the agreement, DesalCo Barbados Limited provides operations and maintenance services for a
seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant. The carrying amount attributable to the intangible
asset of the operations agreement is being amortized over the remaining term of the five-year
agreement and has a weighted average useful life of 30years dAs part of the acquisition of Ocean Conversion Cayman Limited, the Company originally
attributed $4,598,785 to intangible assets which was adjusted in 2004 by $213,289 for a total
balance of $4,385,496. This represent the fair value of three Water Production and Supply
Agreements between Ocean Conversion Cayman Limited and the Government of the Cayman Islands,
dated April25, 1994, June18, 1997 and December31, 2001. Under these agreements, Ocean
Conversion Cayman Limited built reverse osmosis seawater desalination plants for the Government
of the Cayman Islands. Ocean Conversion Cayman Limited operates the plants until the expiration
of the agreement term, as extended, at which time the plant operations will be transferred to the
Government of the Cayman Islands for no consideration. The carrying amounts attributable to the
intangible assets of the Water Production and Supply Agreements are being amortized over the
remaining term of the agreements, which are approximately 6, 3 and 7years, respectively, and have
a weighted average useful life of 58years. eOn September17, 2003, the Company signed a new agreement with its Belize customer for the
provision of water from a seawater desalination plant for an initial term of 23years. The new
agreement was effective on June1, 2004 after certain conditions precedent were met or waived.
The carrying amount of the Belize Water Production and Supply Agreement was revalued in 2003 to its
fair market value upon signing of the new agreement. The revised carrying amount which was
previously being amortized over its weighed average useful life of 1075years is now being
amortized over the term of the new 23-year agreement and now has a weighted average useful life of
230years. 67 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11. Intangible assets continued

In 2004, goodwill and intangible assets were adjusted by $172,622 due to a revaluation of the fair
market value of those assets. The reporting segments are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter by comparing the fair value
of the reporting segments to the carrying value. The fair value is determined using discounted
cash flow methodology based on managements best estimates for each segment. At December31, 2004,
the Companys impairment tests resulted in no impairment loss. 13. Dividends Quarterly interim dividends were declared in respect of class A common stock and redeemable

stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common shares for all potential common shares
outstanding during the reporting period. In addition, the dilutive effect of stock options is
considered in earnings per common share calculations, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. The following summarizes information related to the computation of basic and diluted earnings per

18. Segment information Due to acquisitions, management changed the Companys internal organizational structure to
effectively assimilate the business activities of the acquired companies. Consequently, management
no longer considers it appropriate to report separate business segments based on geographical
location. Under Statements of Financial Accounting Standards 131, Disclosure about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, management now considers; ithe operations to supply water
to retail customers, iithe operations to supply water to bulk customers, and iiithe provision
of engineering and management services, as separate business segments. The segmented information
that was previously reported in 2002 for the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas is now reported as part
of the Retail Water segment and segmented information for Belize is now reported as part of the
Bulk Water segment. Included in our Bulk segment is our proportional share of results of operations, property, plant
and equipment and total assets of Ocean Conversion BVILtd. An adjustment has been made in
Reconciliation to adjust the Companys interest in its investment under the equity method of
accounting. Also included in Reconciliation are corporate expenses that do not directly relate to any specific
operating segment. 72 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18. Segment information continued

of the grant date and ending on the thirtieth day after the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Non-Executive Directors Share Plan In 1999, the Company introduced a stock grant plan, which forms part of Directors remuneration.
Under the plan Directors receive a combination of cash and ordinary shares in consideration of

Officers, who are covered by individual employment contracts and the Government elected board
member. The number of ordinary shares granted is calculated with reference to a strike price that

31, 2004 totaled shares of 4,630 2003: 7,735 at a strike price of $1775 2003: $1179. Directors and senior management stock compensation Effective January1, 2004, the option plan for senior management was amended as part of

22. Taxation Under current laws of the Cayman Islands, there are no income, estate, corporation, capital gains
or other taxes payable by the Company on its Cayman Islands operations. Under the current laws of Belize, the Company has received a tax exemption with respect to its
Belize operations. The exemption expires in January2006 and there is no certainty it will be
renewed. However, if not renewed there would be no impact to the Company as any taxes paid will be
passed through to the customer through a rate change. Under current laws of The Commonwealth of The Bahamas, there are no income, corporation, capital
gains or other taxes payable by the Company. The Company is required to pay an annual business
license fee, the calculation of which is based on the preceding years financial statements, and
such fees are payable between January and April of the subsequent year. 78 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22. Taxation continued Under the current laws of Barbados, the Companys Barbados operations are subject to a 40% Barbados
corporate tax and all dividend payments and non-tax treaty supplier payments are subject to a
Barbados withholding tax of 15%. As at December31, 2004, the Company had $nil income tax
receivable or payable and as at December31, 2003, the Company had income tax receivable in the
amount of $3,335. The Company has not recorded any deferred tax asset or liability as management
believes that such items would be, if any, immaterial to the financial statements. A substantial majority of the net income of the Company is currently not subject to taxation. The
overall net tax expense is less than 1%, which is attributable to continuing operations in
Barbados. There are no significant permanent reconciling items.
For the year ended December31, 2004, total net income before income taxes and minority
interest was $6,279,792. Net income before income taxes for domestic operations was $4,245,866 2003: $3,018,542; 2002 2,419,425 and net income before taxes for all the foreign country operations was $1,981,667
2003: $1,182,282; 2002: $156,885. 23. Pension benefits Staff pension plans are offered to all employees in the Cayman Islands. The plans are administered
by third party pension plan providers and are defined contribution plans whereby the Company
matches the contribution of the first 5% of each participating employees salary up to $72,000.
The total amount recognized as an expense under the plan during the year ended December31, 2004
was $145,234 2003: $119,800; 2002: $70,210. 24. Financial instruments Credit risk The Company is not exposed to significant credit risk on the vast majority of customer accounts as
the policy is to cease supply of water to customers accounts that are more than 45days overdue.
The Companys exposure to credit risk is concentrated on receivables from its Bulk water customers.
The balances from these customers are current or an allowance has been made for collection as at
December31, 2004. Management does not anticipate any losses on these concentrations. Interest rate risk The interest rates and terms of the Companys loans are presented in Note 14 of these financial
statements. The Company is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the LIBOR or Nassau
Prime Lending rates change. Foreign exchange
risk All relevant foreign currencies have fixed exchange rates to the United States dollar as detailed
under the foreign currency accounting policy note. If any of these fixed exchange rates become
floating exchange rates, the Companys results of operations could be adversely affected. Fair values At December31, 2004 and 2003, the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and other liabilities and dividends payable approximate fair values
due to the short term maturities of these assets and liabilities. Management considers that the
carrying amounts for loans receivable and long term debt due to Scotiabank and the Royal Bank of
Canada approximate their fair value. 79 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25. Non-cash transactions The Company executed the following non-cash transactions

26. Impact of recent accounting standards pronouncements The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued one interpretation and three standards that
affect the Company. A summary of this interpretation and these standards are given below In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued Interpretation No46R,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which replaces FASB Interpretation No46. This
interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities,
which have one or more of the characteristics defined in the Interpretation. Application of this
Interpretation is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in
variable interest entities for periods ending after December15, 2003. Application by public
entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March15, 2004. The
interpretation is intended to achieve more consistent application of consolidated policies to
variable interest entities or disclose information about variable interest entities in which
consolidation does not occur to help users assess the enterprises risks. The application of this
Interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 80 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED WATER CO. LTD. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 26. Impact of recent accounting standards pronouncements continued In December2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No151,
Inventory Costs. SFAS No151 amends the guidance in ABR No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing,
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs,
and waste material. This statement requires a company to record those items as current period
charges regardless of whether they meet the criteria of so abnormal. In addition, this statement
also requires a company to allocate fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion based on
the normal capacity of production facilities. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No151 on or
before June15, 2005. The application of this Interpretation is not expected to have a material
effect on the Companys financial statements. In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchange of Nonmonetary Assets. SFAS No153
amends APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions to eliminate the exception for
nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for
exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. The Company is required to
adopt SFAS No153 on or before June15, 2005. The application of this Interpretation is not
expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. In December2004, the FASB revised SFAS No123, Share-Based Payments. SFAS No123 eliminates
the alternative to use Opinion 25s intrinsic value method of accounting and requires the Company
to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
based on the grant-date fair value of the reward. That cost will be recognized over the period
during which an employee is required to provided service in exchange for the award. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS No123 at the beginning of the first annual period after June15, 2005.
The Company is in the process of reviewing SFAS No123 and as at December31, 2004 is unable to
make a determination if adoption will have a material effect on the Companys financial statements. 81 Table of Contents Independent Auditors Report The Board of Directors
Ocean Conversion BVILtd We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Ocean Conversion BVILtd. and its
subsidiary the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by
the Auditing Standards Board United States and in accordance with the auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal controls over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material aspects, the financial position of Ocean Conversion BVILtd. and its subsidiary as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. s/ KPMG Chartered Accountants

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 86 Table of Contents OCEAN CONVERSION BVILTD. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Principal activity These financial statements include the accounts of Ocean Conversion BVILtd. and its
majority-owned subsidiary, JVD Ocean Desalination Ltd. together, the Company. Ocean Conversion BVILtd. was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands under the Companies Act,
Cap 285, on May14, 1990 and is engaged in the production and sale of potable water to the
Government of the British Virgin Islands the Government. The Company has an agreement with the
Government, its sole customer, to produce and supply a guaranteed quantity and quality of potable
water. This agreement provides for specific penalties should the Company not be able to provide
the guaranteed quantity of water. On January24, 1992, Ocean Conversion BVILtd. amended the original agreement with the Government
to allow for the expansion of its plant in order to increase its production capacity from 360,000
imperial gallons of water to 510,000 imperial gallons per day. Under this agreement, the
Government had the option to purchase the facility in May1999, at a cost of $1,420,000 or renew
the agreement for a period of seven years. The Government did not exercise its option to purchase
the plant but advised Ocean Conversion BVILtd. of its desire to continue the agreement on a
month-to-month basis until a new agreement is negotiated. JVD Ocean Desalination Ltd. JVD was incorporated on January2, 2003 and began producing potable
water for the Government on July10, 2003. On February5, 2005 JVD executed a contract with the
Government of the British Virgin Islands with the agreement that all water delivered before the
contract was signed would be invoiced upon signing of the contract. During 2003, the amount of
water delivered or the expenses occurred were not material to the financial statements of the
majority owned parent Company, Ocean Conversion BVILtd. These amounts have been recorded in the
consolidated financial statements of Ocean Conversion BVILtd. along with the portion relating to
the minority interests. 2. Accounting policies Basis of preparation: The consolidated financial statements presented are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis of consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of
Ocean Conversion BVILtd. and its majority owned subsidiary JVD Ocean Desalination Ltd. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management of the
Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property,
plant and equipment and inventory. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank on call and highly
liquid deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Trade accounts receivable: Trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts based on
meter readings reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts. The allowance
for doubtful accounts is the Companys best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the
Companys existing accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on
historical write-off experience. Interest income: The Company earns interest income on trade accounts receivable based on the
overdue invoices from its customer. The interest is earned on an accrual basis. 87 Table of Contents OCEAN CONVERSION BVILTD. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. Accounting policies continued Deferred fees: Deferred fees consist of the bank financing fees paid on the drawdown of the
Companys long term debt and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the
loan. Inventory: Inventory primarily includes replacement spares and parts that are valued at the lower
of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Impairment of long-lived assets: In accordance with SFAS No144, long-lived assets, such as
property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by
the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Property, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using a straight line method with an allowance for
estimated residual values. Rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets
as follows   
Plant and equipment
4 to 25 years
Office furniture, fixtures and equipment
3 to 10 years
Vehicles
3 to 10 years
Lab Equipment
3 to 10 years
Additions to property, plant and equipment are comprised of the cost of the contracted services,
direct labour and materials. Assets under construction are recorded as additions to property,
plant and equipment upon completion of the projects. Depreciation commences in the month of
addition. Interest costs directly attributable to the construction of qualifying assets, which are assets
that necessarily take a substantial period of time to ready for their intended use, are added to
the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for use or sale. Water sales and cost of water sales: The Government is billed monthly based on meter readings
performed at or near each month end and in accordance with the water sales agreement, which
stipulates minimum monthly charges for water service. Repairs and maintenance: All repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 3. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are not restricted as to withdrawal or use. 4. Accounts receivable Accounts receivable comprise receivables from our sole customer, the Government of the British
Virgin Islands. Significant concentrations of credit risk are disclosed in Note 15. 88 Table of Contents OCEAN CONVERSION BVILTD. NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5. Inventory
