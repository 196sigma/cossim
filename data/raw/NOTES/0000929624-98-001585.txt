REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Genesys
Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. a California Corporation and
subsidiaries as of June 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended June 30, 1998. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Genesys Telecommunications
Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended June 30, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed under Item 14a2
is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

1. THE COMPANY
Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. formerly Enhanced Voice
Processing, Inc., was incorporated in California on October 11, 1990. During
fiscal 1995, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. established a
wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, and in fiscal 1996 it
established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia. Also in fiscal 1996, Genesys
Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. entered into a joint venture in Canada
through which it owned 51% of a Canadian corporation, Genesys Laboratories
Canada, Inc. In February 1997, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc.
acquired the remaining 49% of Genesys Laboratories Canada, Inc. In fiscal
1997, Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. established wholly-owned
subsidiaries in Australia, France and Japan. In fiscal 1998, the Company

that enable organizations to integrate critical business information and
computing resources with telephony and other telecommunications media. The
Company products are marketed primarily in North America, Europe and Asia.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Genesys
Telecommunications Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company subsidiaries is the local currency.
Accordingly, the Company applies the current rate method to translate the
subsidiaries' financial statements into U.S. dollars. Translation adjustments
are included as a separate component of shareholders' equity in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions are recorded in other income expense in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and were not material in any of the periods
presented.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the
consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Impairment of Long Lived Assets
The Company reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. As of June 30, 1998, no
impairment losses have been incurred.
41
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenues from licensing the rights to use its software
products directly to end users and indirectly through value-added resellers.
The Company also generates revenues from sales of post-contract support,
consulting and training services performed for customers who license the
Company products.
The Company recognizes revenues and records estimated warranty reserves from
software license agreements with end users and VARs upon shipment of the
software if there are no significant post-delivery obligations and if
collection is probable. If a software license agreement provides for
acceptance criteria that extend beyond the published specifications of the
applicable product, then revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer
acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period. If a software license
agreement provides for the delivery of software products and significant
customization and modification services under a fixed price arrangement,
product and service revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis
unless the elements can be segmented as defined in SOP 81-1.
Customers who purchase post-contract support services under maintenance
agreements have the right to receive unspecified product updates, upgrades and
enhancements. Customers that do not purchase post-contract support must
purchase product updates, upgrades and enhancements under separate agreements
that are subject to the criteria of the Company revenue recognition policy.
Revenues from post-contract support services are recognized ratably over the
term of the support period. If post-contract support services are included
free or at a discount in a license agreement, such amounts are allocated out
of the license fee at their fair market value based on the value established
by independent sale of such post-contract support services to customers.
Consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services performed
on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to
the installation of the Company software products. Revenues from consulting
and training services are recognized as services are performed. If a
transaction includes both license and service elements, license fee revenue is
recognized upon shipment of the software, provided services do not include
significant customization or modification of the base product and the payment
terms for licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria. In cases where
license fee payments are contingent upon the acceptance of services, revenues
from both the license and the service elements are deferred until the
acceptance criteria are met.
Cost of license revenues includes the costs of product media, product
duplication and manuals, as well as allocated labor and overhead costs related
to preparation and shipment of the product. Cost of service revenues consists
primarily of salaries, benefits and allocated overhead costs related to
consulting personnel and the customer service department.
Deferred revenues include software license fees and services that have been
invoiced to the customer for which the revenue earnings process has not been
completed.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The Company investments have consisted of tax-exempt debt
securities and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less and money market accounts.
Short-term Investments
Under the provisions of SFAS No. 115, the Company investments, which
consist primarily of tax-exempt debt securities, are classified as available-
for-sale and are stated at fair value. The difference between cost and
42
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
fair value of all of the Company short-term investments is insignificant.
Such investments are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses,
if material, are recorded as a separate component of equity until realized.
Interest income is recorded using an effective interest rate, with associated
premium or discount amortized to investment income. The cost of securities
sold is based upon the specific identification method. All available-for-sale
securities are classified as current assets and mature within 12 months.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets or over the lease term if it is
shorter for leasehold improvements, which range from 3 to 5 years. Property
and equipment leased under capital leases is amortized over the lesser of its
useful life or the lease term.
Software Development Costs
The Company capitalizes internally generated software development costs in
compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed. Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon
the establishment of technological feasibility for the product. The Company
capitalized approximately $19 million of software development in fiscal 1998
and $450,000 in fiscal 1997. Prior to fiscal 1997, costs that were eligible
for capitalization were insignificant and, thus, the Company has charged these
costs to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs begins when
the products are available for general release to customers, and is computed
on a product-by-product basis as the greater of: a the ratio of current
gross revenues for a product to the total of current and anticipated future
gross revenues for the product; or b the straight-line method over the
remaining estimated economic life of the product generally two to three
years. The Company amortized $256,000 of capitalized software development
costs in fiscal 1998. No amortization was recorded in fiscal 1997 as these
costs were incurred and capitalized near the end of the fiscal year.
Net Income Loss Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128,
which was adopted by the Company in the quarter ended December 31, 1997, and
in accordance with this standard all prior periods presented have been
restated to conform to its provisions. Under the new requirements for
calculating earnings per share, the dilutive effect of potential common shares
is excluded from basic net income loss per share. Diluted net income loss
per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and
potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares
consist of preferred stock using the if converted method and stock options
and warrants using the treasury stock method. Potential common shares are
excluded from the dilutive computation only if their effect is anti-dilutive
In February 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin 98, which included SEC requirements related to the
adoption of SFAS 128. The Company applied these provisions to the calculation
of basis and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for all periods
presented in the accompanying statements of operations.

In August 1996, the Company effected a 3:1 stock split of its Common Stock,
and in November 1996 the Company effected a 2:1 stock split of its Common
Stock. In February 1997, the Company effected a 6:1 stock split of its Series
A and Series B Preferred Stock.
All share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the stock splits,
including the reflection of all preferred share and per share data on an as
converted basis.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2,
which will be adopted by the Company in fiscal 1999. SOP 97-2 clarifies and
amends certain provisions of Statement of Position 91-1, Software Revenue
Recognition. The Company does not believe the adoption of the provisions of
SOP 97-2 will have a material impact on the Company financial position or
results of operations.
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 129, Disclosure of Information about
Capital Structure SFAS 129, which was adopted by the Company in fiscal
1998. SFAS 129 continues the existing requirements to disclose the pertinent
rights and privileges or all securities other than ordinary common stock but
expands the number of companies subject to portions of its requirements. The
adoption of this statement had no impact on the Company financial
statements.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income
SFAS 130, which is required to be adopted by the Company in its first
quarter of fiscal 1999. At that time, the Company will be required to
disclose, in financial statement format, all non-owner changes in equity. Such
changes include, for example, cumulative foreign currency translation
adjustments, certain minimum pension liabilities and unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities. The Company does not expect the
adoption of SFAS 130 to have a material impact on the Company financial
statements.
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131, which establishes standards
for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and interim financial reports. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services,
44
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
geographic areas and major customers. As defined in SFAS 131, operating
segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. Generally, financial information is required to be reported on
the basis that is used internally for evaluating segment performance and
deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The Company will adopt SFAS
131 in fiscal 1999. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 131 to
have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable. As of
June 30, 1998, approximately 15% of accounts receivable were concentrated with
2 customers, and as of June 30, 1997, approximately 11% of accounts receivable
were concentrated with 2 customers. The Company generally does not require
collateral on accounts receivable, as the majority of the Company customers
are large, well established companies. The Company provides reserves for
credit losses and such losses have been insignificant in all periods presented
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
For cash equivalents, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of those instruments. For debt, the fair value is estimated
based on market prices for similar debt instruments, and the carrying amount
approximates fair value. Substantially all of the Company cash and cash
equivalents are held in five financial institutions.
4. ACQUISITION
In December 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock
of Forte Advanced Management Software, Inc. Forte in exchange for
approximately 667,099 shares of the Company common stock. The Company also
assumed Forte outstanding options, which were converted to options to
purchase approximately 90,385 shares of the Company common stock. The merger
was accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements have been restated to reflect the acquisition on a
pooling of interests basis.
Net revenue and income of the separate companies for the years ended June

respectively.
6. COMMITMENTS AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS
In June 1997, the Company entered into a long-term note payable with a
vendor. The note is unsecured and bears interest at 674% per annum.
The Company leases its facilities under noncancellable operating lease

7. LITIGATION
On December 17, 1996, GeoTel Communications Corporation GeoTel filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
naming the Company as defendant, and alleging
46
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
infringement of a patent issued to GeoTel entitled Communications System
Using a Central Controller to Control at Least One Network and Agent System,
U.S. Patent No. 5,546,452 the GeoTel Patent. In the complaint, GeoTel
requested injunctive relief, an accounting for damages and an assessment of
interest and costs, and other relief as the court deems just and proper. On
February 10, 1997, the Company filed an answer in response to the complaint
filed by GeoTel, asserting that the GeoTel Patent is invalid, denying the
alleged patent infringement and seeking dismissal of the complaint with
prejudice. The litigation is currently in early discovery stages, with
depositions to commence fall of 1998 and fact discovery scheduled to be
completed in January 1999. The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to the asserted claims and intends to defend the litigation
vigorously. GeoTel alleges that the Genesys Call Router, Genesys Call Center
Manager and Genesys Call Concentrator products, and the T Server product, as a
necessary element of all Genesys products, infringe the GeoTel Patent. After
consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe any of the products
described under Business--Products infringe any valid claims of the GeoTel
Patent. In connection with the Company development of the potential new
products described under Business--Research and Development, the Company has
sought the advice of such counsel and believes that such potential products
can be developed without infringing the GeoTel Patent; however, there can be
no assurance that GeoTel will not assert infringement of the GeoTel Patent
with respect to such potential new products. Further, the outcome of
litigation is inherently unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that the
results of these proceedings will be favorable to the Company or that they
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company business, financial
condition or results of operations. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, the
GeoTel litigation could result in substantial expense to the Company and
significant diversion of effort by the Company technical and managerial
personnel. If the Court determines that the Company infringes GeoTel patent
and that the GeoTel patent is valid and enforceable, it could issue an
injunction against the use or sale of certain of the Company products and it
could assess significant damages against the Company. Accordingly, an adverse
determination in the proceeding could subject the Company to significant
liabilities and require the Company to seek a license from GeoTel. Although
patent and other intellectual property disputes in the software area have
sometimes been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs
associated with such arrangements may be substantial, and there can be no
assurance that a license from GeoTel, if required, would be available to the
Company on acceptable terms or at all. Accordingly, an adverse determination
in the GeoTel litigation could prevent the Company from licensing certain of
its software products, which would have a material adverse effect on the
Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
8. BANK LINE OF CREDIT
In October 1996, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement. Under
the terms of the agreement, the Company may borrow up to $30 million under a
revolving line of credit, which includes sublimits of $500,000 for equipment
purchases and $500,000 for letters of credit. The line of credit is secured by
substantially all of the Company assets and advances are limited to 80% of
eligible accounts receivable. The line of credit expired July 31, 1997.
9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Loans from Officers, Shareholders and Their Affiliates
During fiscal 1997, the Company borrowed an aggregate of $33,000 from
officers, shareholders and their affiliates. No amount was outstanding as of
June 30, 1998. Certain of these related party loans were non-interest bearing;
however, the imputed interest related to the borrowings was immaterial.
In February 1996, the minority interest shareholder of the Company
Canadian subsidiary provided the subsidiary with a convertible revolving line
of credit for CDN $20 million, of which USD$367,000 was outstanding as of
June 30, 1996. Loan amounts are due on December 31, 1997 and bear interest at
a rate charged
47
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
by the Royal Bank of Canada for 30 day Bankers Acceptances plus approximately
42 basis points. Borrowings under this facility are secured by all of the
assets of the subsidiary. In March 1997, subsequent to the Company
acquisition of the minority shareholders' shares in the Canadian subsidiary
Note 12, all amounts outstanding under this facility were repaid, and the
facility was canceled.
10. COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK
In March 1996, the Company issued 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
at a price of $22167 per share. In June 1996, the Company issued 1,897,878
shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a price of $36883 per share. In
February 1997, the Company issued 854,363 shares of Series C Preferred Stock
at a price of $1112 per share.
In June 1997, the Company completed its initial public offering of 2,375,000
shares of Common Stock at $1800 per share. In connection with the initial
public offering, all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock automatically
converted into Common Stock. In addition, the Company issued 420,282 shares of
Common Stock in connection with the exercise of certain warrants prior to the
closing of the offering.
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements
Since inception, the Company has sold an aggregate of 6,281,500 shares of
Common Stock to certain employees in connection with their employment and to
certain vendors. All of these shares were sold at the fair market value as of
the date of purchase as determined by Board of Directors. All of these shares
are subject to stock repurchase agreements whereby the Company has the right
to repurchase unvested shares upon termination of employment or engagement at
the original price paid for the shares. Vesting generally occurs 25% on the
first anniversary date of employment or engagement and monthly thereafter over
the following 36 months. As of June 30, 1998, an aggregate of 508,500 shares
of Common Stock have been repurchased under these agreements, and 1,458,860
shares are subject to the Company repurchase right at prices ranging from
$001667 to $0375 per share.
Stock Plans
In March 1997, the Board adopted the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan the 1997
Plan, which serves as a successor to the Company 1995 Stock Option Plan
the 1995 Plan. All shares issued under the 1995 Plan were transferred to
the 1997 Plan upon the effectiveness of the Company initial public offering.
The Company has reserved shares of Common Stock for issuance under the 1997
Plan equal to the sum of i the shares which remained available for issuance
under the 1995 Plan, including the shares subject to outstanding options
thereunder, and ii an additional increase of 2,400,000 shares. In addition,
upon the completion of each fiscal year of the Company, beginning with the
1999 fiscal year, the share reserve will automatically be increased on the
first trading day of July each year by a number of shares equal to five
percent 5% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar month. Accordingly, on
July 1, 1998, the share reserve was automatically increased by 1,120,761
shares.
The 1997 Plan is divided into four separate components: i the
Discretionary Option Grant Program, under which eligible individuals in the
Company employ or service including officers and other employees, non-
employee Board members and independent consultants may, at the discretion of
the Plan Administrator, be granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock
at an exercise price not less than their fair market value on the grant date,
ii the Stock Issuance Program, under which such individuals may, in the Plan
Administrator discretion, be issued shares of Common Stock directly, either
through the purchase of such shares at a price not less than their fair market
value at the time of issuance or as a fully-vested bonus for services rendered
the Company, iii the Salary Investment Option Grant Program, under which
executive officers and other highly
48
GENESYS TELECOMMUNICATIONS LABORATORIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED
compensated employees may elect to apply a portion of their base salary to the
acquisition of special below-market stock option grants, and iv the
Automatic Option Grant Program, under which option grants will automatically
be made at periodic intervals to eligible non-employee Board members to
purchase shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to their fair
market value on the grant date.
Under the Company 1997 Plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive
and nonqualified stock options to employees, directors and consultants. The
exercise price per share for an incentive stock option cannot be less than the
fair market value on the date of grant. The exercise price per share for a
nonqualified stock option cannot be less than 85% of the fair market value on
the date of grant. Options granted under the Option Plan generally expire ten
years after the date of grant and generally vest over a four year period. As
of June 30, 1998, a total of 10,692,834 shares of Common Stock have been
authorized for grant under the 1997 Plan. On July 1, 1998, this share amount
increased to 11,813,595 as a result of the automatic increase provision of the
1997 Plan.
On December 31, 1997, the Company acquired Forte Advanced Management
Software, Inc. Forte. The Company assumed Forte outstanding options
granted under its stock option plan, which were converted to options to
purchase approximately 90,385 shares of the Company Common Stock. No further
options are available for future grant under the Forte stock option plan, and
the Company has reserved for issuance shares of its Common Stock for the
exercise of the Forte stock options. As of June 30, 1998, 15,421 of these
shares were vested and exercisable.

1997 Plan. The weighted average of fair values of options granted during both
fiscal 1998 and 1997 was $1200
In connection with the issuance of stock options and common stock to
employees and consultants, the Company has recorded deferred compensation in
the aggregate amount of approximately $19 million, representing the
difference between the deemed fair value of the Company common stock and the
issue price of the common stock or the exercise price of stock options at the
date of grant. The Company is amortizing the deferred compensation expense
over the applicable vesting period, which is typically four years. For fiscal
1998 and 1997, amortization expense was approximately $477,000 and $214,000,
respectively. No compensation expense was recorded in fiscal 1996.

The fair value of each option grant under the 1997 Plan is estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions used for grants: risk-free rates ranging from 5-7% and
corresponding to government securities with original maturities similar to the
vesting periods; expected dividend yield of 0%; expected lives of 3 years
beyond vest dates; and expected volatility of 56% and 115% in fiscal 1998 and
1997, respectively.
1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In March 1997, the Board adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the
Purchase Plan. The Company has reserved 500,000 shares of Common Stock for
issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan enables eligible employees
to purchase common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
Company common stock on the first or the last day of each offering period.
As of June 30, 1998, 70,573 shares had been purchased under the Purchase Plan.

ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS
Warrants Issued to Consultant
In connection with a services consulting agreement, in April 1996, the
Company issued a warrant to a shareholder for the purchase of 420,282 shares
of Common Stock at an exercise price of $595 per share. The fair value of the
warrant at the date of grant was not material. In June 1997, the warrant was
exercised in full.
Warrants Issued to Series C Shareholders
Concurrent with the closing of the sale of Series C Preferred Stock to two
corporate investors, the Company issued warrants for the purchase of 449,664
shares of Common Stock to one investor exercisable at a price of $3500 per
share and 44,965 shares of Common Stock to the other investor exercisable at a
price of 110% of the fair market value of Common Stock on the date such shares
vest. The warrants expire in February 2004 and February 2000, respectively.
Each of these warrants becomes exercisable upon the achievement of certain
sales and development objectives specified in the warrant agreements. In
accordance with SFAS 123 and related interpretations, the Company recorded the
aggregate estimated fair value of the warrants of $650,000 in February 1997,
and will amortize the value of the warrants to cost of license revenues as the
sales and development milestones are achieved. Amortization of the warrants is
computed as the greater of a the ratio of current gross revenues generated
to total revenue milestones under the agreement or b the straight-line
method over the life of the agreement with MCI. Amortization expense recorded
in fiscal 1998 was approximately $203,000.

12. ACQUISITION OF MINORITY INTEREST IN CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY
In February 1996, the Company entered into a joint venture in Canada through
which it owned 51% of a Canadian corporation, Genesys Laboratories Canada,
Inc. GenCan. While the Company owned a majority of this joint venture in
fiscal 1996, certain provisions of the February 1996 joint venture agreement
provided for shared control of the entity, and accordingly the entity should
have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting. However, the
Company has consolidated the entity in the accompanying fiscal 1996 financial
statements for presentation purposes as the effect of using the consolidation
method is not material. In January 1997, the respective Boards of Directors of
the Company and the minority shareholder of GenCan reached agreement on the
terms and conditions of and signed a memorandum of understanding for the
purchase by the Company of the 49% minority shares of GenCan in exchange for
675,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company valued at approximately $325
per share. In February 1997, the Company issued 675,000 shares of Common
Stock to the minority shareholder in accordance with the terms of the January
agreement. In connection with this acquisition, which has been accounted for
as a purchase, the Company has allocated the excess purchase price over the
fair value of the net assets acquired, approximately $2 million, to goodwill.
The Company will amortize this intangible asset on a straight-line basis over
84 months, which is its estimated expected useful life. Amortization expense
in fiscal 1998 was $449,000. On the basis of a pro forma consolidation as if
the acquisition had taken place in February 1996, revenue would not have
changed, net income and net income per share would have been $469,000 and
$002, respectively, for year ended June 30, 1997 and net loss and net loss
per share would have been $35 million and $019, respectively, for the year
ended June 30, 1996.
