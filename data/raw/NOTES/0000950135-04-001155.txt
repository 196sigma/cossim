ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA REPORT OF MANAGEMENT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries Management is responsible for preparing the RSA Security Inc. financial
statements and the other information that appears in this annual report.
Management believes that the financial statements fairly reflect the form and
substance of transactions and reasonably present the Companys financial
condition and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Management has included in the
Companys financial statements amounts that are based on estimates and
judgments, which it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company maintains a system of internal accounting policies, procedures,
and controls intended to provide reasonable assurance, at appropriate cost,
that transactions are executed in accordance with Company authorization and
are properly recorded and reported in the financial statements, and that
assets are adequately safeguarded.
Deloitte Touche LLP, the independent auditing firm, is retained to audit
the Companys consolidated financial statements. Their accompanying report is
based on an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America.
The RSA Security Inc. Board of Directors has an Audit Committee composed of
independent Directors. The Committee meets with financial management and the
independent auditors to review internal accounting controls and accounting,
auditing, and financial reporting matters. s/ Arthur W. Coviello, Jr.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
RSA Security Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RSA Security
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in  a 2. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of RSA Security Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, in 2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Boston, Massachusetts

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In thousands, except share and per share data 1.Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Business RSA Security Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company
provide interoperable solutions for establishing online identities, access
rights and privileges for people, applications and devices. Built to work
seamlessly in the complex environments of its customers, the Companys
portfolio of e-security solutions includes identity and access management,
secure mobile and remote access, secure enterprise access and secure
transactions. The Company sells to Enterprise customers seeking turnkey
security solutions, and to Developers seeking software development components
for embedding security in software applications or hardware devices.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On
an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the
Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when earned. The Companys revenue
recognition policies are in compliance with all applicable accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, including the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, and SOP 98-9, Modification of
SOP 97-2 With Respect to Certain Transactions. The Company recognizes revenue
from the sale of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is
considered probable. The Company recognizes revenue from licensing other
intellectual property when evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed
or determinable and collection is considered probable. The Company reduces
revenue by provisions for estimated returns. When arrangements contain multiple
elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all
undelivered elements, the Company recognizes revenue for the delivered elements
using the residual method. For arrangements containing multiple elements where
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all
undelivered elements, the Company defers revenue for the delivered and
undelivered elements until vendor specific objective evidence of fair value
exists or all elements have been delivered. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No48, Revenue Recognition when Right
of Return Exists, the Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to
its stocking distributors, net of estimated returns. The Company defers
maintenance services revenue, whether sold separately or as part of a multiple
element arrangement, and recognizes it ratably over the term of the maintenance
contract, generally twelve months.
For arrangements which contain an initial prepaid license fee with the payment
of ongoing royalties, the Company recognizes revenue on the initial prepaid
license fee when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is considered
probable. The ongoing royalties are recognized at the time a reliable estimate
can be made of the actual usage that has occurred, provided collection is
probable. Annual license fees or onetime license fee arrangements typically
contain non-refundable terms, therefore the Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is
fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable.
The Company recognizes revenue allocated to professional service elements as
the services are performed. When the customization is essential to the
functionality of the licensed software, then both the software license and
professional services revenue are recognized under the percentage of completion
method, which requires revenue to be recognized as a percentage of the project
completed. The Company recognizes revenue and gross profit using labor hours as
an input measure of progress to completion on these arrangements.
Allowance for Sales Returns Allowances for estimated sales returns and
allowances on products and maintenance and professional service revenue are
recorded in the same period as the related revenue is recorded. The Company
bases these estimates on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo
data, current economic trends, product line and customer industry and other
known factors.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys
customers to make required payments. The Company analyzes accounts receivable
and the composition of
the accounts receivable aging, historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness,
current economic trends, and changes in customer
47 Table of Contents
payment terms when evaluating
the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Bad debt expense is
included in marketing and selling expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations.
Allowance for Warranty Obligations The Companys standard practice is to
provide a warranty on all RSA SecurID hardware authenticators for the customer
selected programmed life of the authenticator generally two to five years and
to replace any defective authenticators other than authenticators damaged by a
users abuse or alteration free of charge. The Company sells its other
products to customers with a warranty for product defects for a specified
period, generally ninety days. The Company provides reserves for warranty
obligations based on historical failure and defective return rates and includes
these costs as a component of product cost of revenue. The Company reevaluates
the estimate of warranty and defective return obligations, including the
assumptions about estimated failure and return rates, each quarter.
During 2002 and 2003, the Companys quarterly analysis of historical failure
and defective return rates indicated that certain authenticators produced
between 2000 and 2002 were subject to higher defect and failure rates. The
Company has increased its provisions for warranty expense accordingly. The
Company will continue to monitor warranty claims and reevaluate its estimate of
warranty and defective return obligations in future periods, which may result
in the Company recording additional warranty expense.
The Company monitors warranty claims and addresses defects through its quality
and design processes, which are managed by its product engineering, quality
control and technical support organizations. During the last several years,
the Company has increased resources and initiated new programs to build an
expanded family of high performance authentication solutions. These programs
have resulted in the redesign and re-engineering of authenticator products to
improve performance and reliability by incorporating new microprocessors,
electronics, firmware and batteries with longer life.
Accrued warranty reserve is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities
in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and was as follows

Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments purchased with a remaining
maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Inventory Inventory consists primarily of RSA SecurID authenticators and is
stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and
revalued for effects of foreign currency translation. Furniture and equipment
are depreciated by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, generally two to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated
by the straight-line method over the lease term or estimated useful live of the
related asset, whichever is shorter. Buildings are depreciated over fifty
years, the estimated useful life. Property and equipment sold or retired is
eliminated from the accounts in the year of disposition and the resulting gain
or loss is reflected in earnings.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill and other acquisition related
identifiable intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired
in a business acquisition accounted for as a purchase, net of accumulated
amortization. Effective January1, 2002 the adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, required that the amortization of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets be discontinued, and instead be evaluated at
least annually for impairment. Accordingly, the Company discontinued amortizing
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of January1, 2002. The
Company evaluates goodwill for impairment on November30 of each year and at an
interim date if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount. The Company
evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets against
the estimated fair value of its assets and will record an impairment charge in
the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceed their estimated
fair value. Estimated fair value is determined based on estimated discounted
future cash flows or a market multiple valuation method.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill The Company tests
long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be
recoverable. The recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by comparing
the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated to the carrying value of
the assets. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the assets, an impairment charge is recognized. The amount of
an
48 Table of Contents
impairment charge is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the
long-lived asset to its fair value. Fair value is determined based on
estimated discounted cash flows.
Deferred Financing Costs Deferred financing costs include investment bank
fees, legal fees and other financing costs paid in connection with the issuance
of convertible debentures and are included on the consolidated balance sheets
in other assets. Deferred financing costs are amortized over the period the
convertible debentures are outstanding using the straight line method, which is
not materially different from the effective interest rate method.
Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate
fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying
value of the convertible debentures is the principal balance of the debentures
outstanding less the fair value of the warrants outstanding, net of accumulated
accretion of the warrants fair value. The Company believes the carrying value
of the convertible debentures approximates the fair value.
The Company accounts for its investment in Crosby Finance, LLC Crosby under
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No96-12, Recognition of Interest
Income and Balance Sheet Classification of Structured Notes. The Company is
carrying its interest in Crosby at fair value with all changes in fair value
included in income from investing activities in the consolidated statements of
operations. The Company determines the fair value based on the fair value of
Crosbys right to potentially receive additional cash proceeds under a variable
delivery forward contract that Crosby holds.
Investments where ownership is less than 20% and the Company does not have
significant influence on the operating or financial decisions of the investee
are accounted for using the cost method. The carrying value of investments is
equal to cost less investment valuation impairment charges. The Company
regularly considers available evidence in evaluating its investments for
potential impairment. Certain events, such as an initial public offering, could
result in the reclassification of an investment to an available for sale
marketable security.
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred. SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be
Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, does not materially affect the Company.
Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were
approximately $869, $2,950, and $4,496 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized based on temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
statutory tax rates and laws expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation
allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the timing
of the temporary differences becoming deductible. Management considers, among
other available information, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and other matters in making this assessment.
Income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
where such earnings are expected to be remitted to the U.S. parent company.
The Company determines annually the amount of unremitted earnings of foreign
subsidiaries to invest indefinitely in its non-U.S. operations. Unrecognized
provisions for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which
are considered permanently invested, are not material to the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Foreign Currency The financial statements of the Companys foreign
subsidiary in Ireland are measured using the U.S. dollar as its functional
currency. The financial statements of all other of the Companys foreign
branches and subsidiaries are measured using the local currencies as the
functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of these branches and
subsidiaries are translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at balance sheet
date exchange rates and translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income. Statements of operations of foreign branches and
subsidiaries are translated from functional currencies to U.S. dollar
equivalents at average exchange rates in effect during the year and any gain or
loss from these translations are also included in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are
included in interest expense, income and other in the consolidated statements
of operations.
Earnings Loss Per Share The Company computes basic earnings lossper
share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The
Company computes diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number
of shares outstanding plus
the effect of potential outstanding shares, including options and warrants,
using the treasury stock method. Diluted loss per share excludes the effect
of equity instruments including convertible debentures, options and warrants,
as such instruments are antidilutive.

Common Stock Split On February1, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors
declared a three-for-two stock split, which was effected in the form of a
common stock dividend. Shares were distributed on March26, 2001 to
stockholders of record on March9, 2001. All references to common stock and
per share amounts in this Annual Report on Form10-K have been adjusted to
reflect the three-for-two common stock split on a retroactive basis.
Common Stock Warrants Warrants to purchase shares of the Companys common
stock are recorded at fair value. The Company estimated the fair value of
warrants using the Black-Scholes model at the time of issuance. The fair value
of the warrants is amortized over the expected life of the related 7%
convertible debentures using the straight-line method, which is not materially
different than the effective interest rate method.
Treasury Stock Shares of the Companys common stock that are repurchased are
recorded in treasury stock at cost and included as a component of stockholders
equity. The Company relieves the costs associated with the reissuance of
shares of common stock out of treasury using the first-in first-out method.
Concentration of Credit Risk The Company provides e-security solutions to
various customers in diverse industries. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for potential credit
losses. The Company has a non-recourse arrangement with a major financial
institution, under which certain of the Companys qualified customers can
obtain financing directly from the financial institution at their own
discretion.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans Stock-based compensation cost is accounted
for using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under this
intrinsic value method, compensation expense, if any, is recognized based on
the difference between the fair value of the underlying stock and the price of
the option at the measurement date. Measurement date is defined as that time
when both the number of shares and the exercise price become known.
Pro Forma Disclosure Had the Company recognized compensation costs for its
stock option and purchase plans based on the fair value for awards under those
plans, in accordance with SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock Based

Reclassification Certain previously disclosed and prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation, including amortization
of technology related intangible assets of $6,587 and $3,281 for the years
ended December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and impairments of technology
related intangible assets of $14,333 for the year ended December31, 2002, have
been reclassified from operating expenses to cost of revenue.
New Accounting Pronouncements Interpretation No46 In January 2003, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which was revised by FIN 46R
issued in December 2003 FIN46. This interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation
by business enterprises of variable interest entities VIE that either: do
not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance
its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or for which
the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling
financial interest. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosure requirements
regarding interests in VIE that are deemed significant, even if consolidation
is not required. FIN 46 applies to interim periods ending after March15,
2004. The Company believes the adoption of FIN 46 will not require the
consolidation of the Companys investment in Crosby and therefore will not have
a significant impact on its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.
2.Acquisitions
During 2001, the Company completed four acquisitions, which were accounted for
as purchases. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired companies
have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since their
respective dates of acquisition. Costs related to these acquisitions are for
investment banking, professional fees and other direct costs, including
employee severance and facilities closure. These costs were recorded on the
dates of acquisition and have been included in the allocation of the purchase
prices.
On September4, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the
capital stock of Securant Technologies, Inc., Securant a privately held
company that developed the ClearTrust Web access management solution; on May
16, 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the capital stock of
3-G International, Inc., 3GI a privately held company that developed smart
card and biometric authentication products; on May22, 2001, the Company
completed its acquisition of substantially all the assets of Transindigo Inc
Transindigo, a privately held company that developed real time Web access
management software products; and on February12, 2001, the Company completed
its acquisition of all of the capital stock of Xcert International, Inc.,
XCert a privately held company that developed digital certificate-based
products for securing e-business transactions.
The adjusted purchase prices and costs of the Securant, 3GI, Transindigo and
Xcert acquisitions were as follows

Pursuant to two separate escrow agreements entered into in connection with the
Securant acquisition, $21,000 of the cash purchase price otherwise payable to
Securants shareholders was placed in escrow, pending settlement of any claims
for breach of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger agreement.
One escrow agreement put $20,000 of the purchase price into an escrow fund. The
Company received $3,300 from this Securant escrow fund during the year ended
December31, 2003 in final settlement of outstanding escrow fund claims, which
resulted in a decrease to goodwill of $3,300. The remainder of the escrow fund
was released to the selling shareholders during March 2003. The second escrow
agreement put $1,000 of the Securant purchase price
into an escrow fund. The remaining unclaimed balance of the $1,000 Securant
escrow fund not subject to a pending claim is scheduled to be released to the
selling shareholders during 2005.
Pursuant to an escrow agreement, $3,000 of the cash purchase price otherwise
payable to 3GIs stockholders was placed in escrow, pending settlement of any
claims for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger
agreement. The Company submitted claims against the 3GI escrow totaling
approximately $3,000 and received an aggregate of $2,637 from the 3GI escrow
fund 51 Table of Contents
in settlement of these claims, of which $70 was received during 2003,
resulting in a decrease to goodwill of $70 during 2003. The remainder of the
escrow fund was released to the selling stockholders during March 2003.
Pursuant to an escrow agreement, $10,500 of the cash purchase price otherwise
payable to Xcerts stockholders was placed in escrow, pending settlement of any
claims for breaches of representations, warranties or covenants in the merger
agreement. The Company released all but $500 of the Xcert escrow fund to the
selling stockholders in August 2002. The Company received approximately $64
from the escrow fund in settlement of certain tax issues during 2002, and the
balance of the $500 was released to the selling stockholders during 2003.
As a result of the Companys adoption of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002 the Company reclassified in-place
workforce related intangible assets of $5,689, $2,021 and $569 arising from the
acquisitions of Xcert, 3GI and Transindigo, respectively, into goodwill,
resulting in an increase to goodwill and a decrease to the carrying value of
intangible assets of $8,279. In addition, upon reclassification of in-place
workforce related intangible assets to goodwill and the determination of
indefinite lived assets, the Company reversed the deferred tax liabilities
related to these intangible assets. The reversal of deferred tax liabilities of
$2,269 and $852 relating to the Xcert and 3GI acquisitions, respectively,
resulted in a decrease to goodwill and deferred tax liabilities of $3,121 for
the year ended December31, 2002.
In 2002, the Company paid $591 to Xcert stockholders upon finalization of the
working capital calculation. The cost of the working capital adjustment has
been added to the purchase price of Xcert and resulted in an increase to
goodwill of $591 during the year ended December31, 2002.
The Company incurred litigation expenses in connection with a patent litigation
relating to the products acquired in the May 2001 acquisition of 3GI and
recorded these expenses as related costs of acquisition. The costs to defend
the 3GI lawsuit were covered by the escrow fund set aside from the 3GI purchase
price. The costs of litigation and disbursements from the 3GI escrow resulted
in a net increase to goodwill of $39 during the year ended December31, 2002.
Allocation of the purchase prices for all four acquisitions completed during
2001 was based on estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on independent appraisals. These allocations were as

The Company recorded an impairment charge of $19,140 during
2002, which reduced the carrying value of these intangible assets to
zero at December31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company did not record
any amortization expense related to these intangible assets after
December31, 2002. As a result of this impairment charge, the
Company reduced the related deferred tax liabilities to zero at
December31, 2002. As a result of its adoption of SFAS No142, the Company discontinued
amortizing all existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and did
not record any related amortization expense after January1, 2002. Had the
provisions of SFAS No141, Business Combinations and No142 been applied,
the Companys net income lossand earnings lossper share would have been

At December31, 2002, the Company applied the provisions of SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, to its
acquired technologies, customer list, trademark and non-compete agreements
intangible assets due to circumstances that indicated the carrying value of
these intangible assets may not be recoverable. The circumstances that led the
Company to believe that the carrying value of its intangible assets may not be
recoverable primarily include lower than expected sales from the Companys
products and higher than anticipated selling and marketing costs associated
with the Companys products that contained or incorporated the acquired
technology or products, and estimates of higher than initially anticipated
resources needed to continue to be competitive in the selling environment of
these products and technologies. During 2002, the Company prepared forecasts of
estimated future cash flows for each of the product lines that incorporated the
acquired technologies, customer list and non-compete agreements intangible
assets and determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated from the use of these intangible assets were less than the carrying
value of the corresponding assets. These estimated undiscounted cash flows
were based upon internal and external data, including an analysis of the
current competitive selling environment, historical sales data, known
operational resources and industry trends. The Company determined the amount of
the impairment loss related to these intangible assets by comparing the
carrying amount of these assets to their fair value at December31, 2002. The
Company determined the fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows
expected to be generated from the use of these assets. The fair value of the
intangible assets was determined to be zero at December31, 2002, and
accordingly, the Company recorded a $19,140 impairment charge for the year
ended December31, 2002 to reduce the carrying amount of its intangible assets
to their fair value.

The amounts allocated to in process research and development IPRD projects
were expensed in the quarter that the related acquisition was consummated if
technological feasibility of the IPRD projects had not been achieved and no
alternate future uses had been established. Research and development costs to
bring the acquired products to technological feasibility are not expected to
have a material impact on the Companys future results of operations or cash
flows. IPRD expense of $7,891 for the year ended December31, 2001 represents
the write off of IPRD in connection with the acquisitions of Securant, Xcert,
3GI and Transindigo.

During 2002, the Company recognized total investment impairment charges
totaling $21,866 related to its investments in privately held companies.
Included in total investment impairment charges in 2002 and as a result of its
initiation of a process to sell its equity investments the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $11,966 to reflect the investments at their estimated
realizable value, less costs of disposal. Also during 2002, and included in
total investment impairment charges the Company recorded an impairment charge
of $9,900 based upon valuations and anticipated cash proceeds to reduce the
carrying amount of three investment to their estimated fair value for three
companies in which the Company had invested that were in the process of
obtaining additional financing or being sold. The Company considered offers to
buy, recent valuations and current financial positions of the investments in
estimating realizable value. Estimated realizable value of these investments
less costs of disposal was $1,400 and was included in investments on the
consolidated balance sheet at December31, 2002. The Company completed the sale
of these investments during 2003 and recognized income of $1,542 from the sale
of investments.
In November 2000, the Company transferred 2,636,916 shares of VeriSign, Inc.
VeriSign common stock, which were covered by three forward contracts
Forwards and one variable delivery forward VDF, to Crosby, of which the
Company is a 99% member. Crosby is a bankruptcy-remote qualified special
purpose entity, established specifically to securitize the shares of VeriSign
common stock. The contribution and the transfer have been accounted for as a
sale under SFAS No125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Accordingly, the Company does not
consolidate Crosby for accounting purposes. The counterparty to the VDF
contract holds the remaining 1% interest in Crosby.
At December31, 2003, Crosby held 2,027,325 shares of VeriSign common stock and
the VDF contract. The VDF contract entitles Crosby to receive cash proceeds of
up to $35,336 depending on the market price of VeriSign common stock on January
3, 2006. The closing price of VeriSigns common stock on The NASDAQ National
Market on December31, 2003 was $1630 per share. Unless the value of the
VeriSign stock appreciates to at least $8716 per share in January 2006, Crosby
will not be entitled to any cash proceeds. Crosby has no liability or
obligation to its members or to the counterparty to the VDF contract other than
to deliver the shares of VeriSign common stock to the counterparty upon
maturity of the VDF contract and to distribute the cash proceeds, if any, to
its members. After settlement of the VDF in January 2006, Crosby will
dissolve.
The carrying amount of the Companys 99% interest in Crosby was $208 and $186
at December31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and is included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for its investment in
Crosby under the guidelines of EITF No96-12, Recognition of Interest Income
and Balance Sheet Classification of Structured Notes. Before the settlement
of the Forwards, the Company used the retrospective interest method to account
for the Companys interest in Crosby as the Company believed it would recover a
substantial amount of its interest. Any increases in the cost basis of the Companys interest
in Crosby, determined by applying the retrospective interest method, were
recorded in interest income. Any changes in the fair value
54 Table of Contents
of the Companys
interest in Crosby were recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders
equity. In the fourth quarter of 2001, after the settlement of the last
Forward, it became reasonably possible that the Company could lose all or
substantially all of the value of its remaining interest, and therefore could
no longer apply the retrospective interest method to its interest in Crosby.
Accordingly, the Company is carrying its interest at fair value with all
changes in fair value reported in income from investing activities in the
statement of operations. The Company determines the fair value of its interest
in Crosby is being determined based on the fair value of Crosbys right to
potentially receive additional cash proceeds upon maturity of the VDF. The
increase in the fair value of the Companys interest in Crosby was $26 for the
year ended December31, 2003.
The gain recorded for financial reporting purposes upon contribution of the VDF
contract to Crosby in 2000 has not been recognized for tax purposes, and
accordingly, the Company recorded a $26,619 deferred tax liability. This
deferred tax liability will reverse upon maturity of the VDF contract in 2006,
and the gain will be included in the calculation of the Companys taxable
income for 2006. The recognition of that gain will result in a tax liability
to the Company and may require the payment of cash to settle the tax liability.
The Company has the right to appoint the members of the Board of Directors of
Crosby, one of whom is required to be an independent director who is not an
employee, director or stockholder of the Company or otherwise affiliated with
the Company and who does not receive any direct or indirect benefit from the
Company. The other members of the Crosby Board of Directors are two of the
Companys officers. None of the Crosby directors has any ownership or interest
in Crosby or its profits or assets, and with the exception of the independent
director, none of the directors is compensated for serving as a director of
Crosby. The Crosby Board of Directors manages the operations of Crosby, but
neither the Crosby Board nor either of the members of Crosby has the power to
cause Crosby to engage in any business other than holding shares of VeriSign
common stock, the Forwards and the VDF and performing its obligations under the
Forwards and the VDF contracts.

5. Convertible Debentures In October and November 2001, the Company issued 7% convertible subordinated
debentures due October17, 2004 with an aggregate principal amount of $80,000,
which generated proceeds of $75,204, net of financing issuance costs. The
debentures mature on October17, 2004, unless redeemed earlier by the Company
as described below or converted into shares of the Companys common stock at
the holders option.
Interest is payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of
each year at a fixed rate of 7% per annum. At any time and at their option,
each holder may convert any outstanding debentures it holds into shares of the
Companys common stock at a conversion price of $13745 per share, which upon
conversion of all of the outstanding debentures would result in the issuance of
approximately 5,820,298 shares of the Companys common stock. The conversion
price of the debentures may be adjusted under certain circumstances, such as
events that would cause dilution of the debenture holders interest. The
Company may redeem all or a portion of the debentures for cash at any time
after October17, 2002 as long as the arithmetic average of the weighted
average price of the Companys common stock on each trading day during the
fifteen trading day period immediately before the election to redeem is at
least 150% of the conversion price. The redemption feature was not exercisable
at December31, 2003. The debentures are unsecured and are subordinated to all
existing and future senior indebtedness. The agreements governing the
convertible debentures contain covenants including restrictions on the
Companys ability to incur and guarantee additional debt. The covenants limit
the amount of additional debt the Company may incur to the lesser of 30% of the
Companys consolidated stockholders equity, which was $92,633 at December31,
2003, or a total of $180,000 including the balance of the 7% convertible
debentures outstanding.
In connection with the issuance of the convertible debentures, and as described
in Note 7, the Company issued warrants on its
common stock to the holders of the convertible debentures. The Company recorded
the fair market value of the warrants as additional paid-in capital during the
year ended December31, 2001 and is amortizing the fair market value through
October 2004. This charge is included in interest expense in the consolidated
statement of operations. In addition, in connection with the issuance of the 7 55 Table of Contents
convertible debentures, the Company paid investment bank fees, legal fees and
other financing costs of $4,796 which are being amortized through October 2004
using the straight-line method, which is not materially different from the
effective interest rate method. Unamortized deferred financing costs of $1,271
are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets at December31,
2003 and 2002. The carrying value of the 7% convertible debentures is as

6. Line of Credit The Company had a $10,000 line of credit agreement with a major financial
institution that was canceled by the Company in November 2003.
7. Stockholders Equity Common Stock Warrants In connection with the issuance of the 7% convertible
debentures in October and November 2001, the Company issued warrants to
purchase shares of its common stock to the holders of the convertible
debentures. The holders may exercise the warrants for an aggregate of 873,045
shares of the Companys common stock at an exercise price of $13745 per share.
The exercise price of the warrants may be adjusted under certain circumstances,
such as events that would cause dilution of the holders interest. The
warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance and expire on October17,
2006. The fair value of the warrants of $4,149 was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions: risk free interest rate of
25%, expected life of 25years, dividend yield of 0%, and expected volatility
of 83%. The Company recorded the fair market value of the warrants as
additional paid-in capital. As of December31, 2003, none of the warrants had
been exercised.
Stockholder Rights Plan On July20, 1999, the Companys Board of Directors
adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan, and a Rights Agreement to govern the Plan,
under which common stock purchase rights each, a Right were distributed to
the Companys stockholders at the rate of one Right for each share of the
Companys common stock. Each Right entitles the stockholder that owns the
Right to purchase one share of the Companys common stock at a purchase price
of $8333 per share, subject to adjustment the Purchase Price. The
Companys stockholders may exercise the Rights 1if another party acquires,
or obtains the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the
Companys common stock, or 2upon the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer that, if consummated, would result in another party acquiring 15% or more
of the Companys common stock. In the event of such an acquisition or similar
event, each Right, other than those owned by the acquiring party, will enable
the stockholder that owns the Right to purchase the number of shares of the
Companys common stock that equals the Purchase Price divided by one-half of
the current market price as defined in the Rights Agreement of the common
stock.
In addition, if the Company is involved in a merger or other transaction with
another company in which the Company is not the surviving corporation, or if
the Company sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning power to
another company, each Right will entitle the stockholder that owns it to
purchase the number of shares of common stock of the acquiring company that
equals the Purchase Price divided by one-half of the current market price of
the acquiring companys common stock. The Company is generally entitled to
redeem the Rights at $0001 per Right at any time until the tenth business day
after the later of 1a public announcement that an acquiring party has
acquired, or obtained the right to acquire, 15% or more of the Companys common
stock or 2the actual knowledge by an executive officer of the Company of
such an acquisition. Unless the Rights are redeemed or exchanged earlier, they
will expire on July20, 2009.
Share Repurchase Program The Company had a common stock repurchase program
from October 1998 to October 2001. Repurchased shares are used for stock
option and employee stock purchase plans, and for general corporate purposes.
Under the repurchase program, the Company repurchased, in total, 15,817,000
shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $422,156, or an average
cost of $2669 per share.
At December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company had zero shares of its
common stock covered by outstanding put options. The Company received $7,565
from the sale of put options on its common stock during the year ended December
31, 2001. During 2001 and upon maturity of one of the Companys put options
contracts covering 375,000 shares of its common stock, the Company
repurchased 375,000 shares of its common stock for $13,943 or $3718 per share.
During 2000, the Company entered into forward equity contracts for 1,500,000
shares of its common stock in order to set purchase prices for its future
repurchase of shares under its share repurchase program. Upon maturity of the
forward equity contracts in
56 Table of Contents

by repurchasing 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for $65,020 or $4335 per
share.

options covering an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of the Companys stock from
counterparties to the put options. The cost to the Company to settle the
terminated put options was $57,647. In addition, during August 2001 the

its common stock and paid $6,168. The Company did not repurchase any shares of
its common stock in connection with these settlements.
8. Stock Option and Purchase Plans Stock Option Exchange Programs In November 2001, the Company offered to all
of its employees and directors the opportunity to request that the Company
exchange the employees and directors outstanding stock options in return for
new stock options to be granted by the Company no sooner than six months and
one day from November12 and December17, 2001, the dates on which each
exchange offer terminated. In exchange for existing options, each option
holder received a commitment for new options to be issued for shares of common
stock equal to three fifths 3/5 of the total number of shares subject to the
options tendered by the option holder and accepted for exchange. Options
covering a total of 8,871,919 shares were accepted for exchange under the

2001. The Company granted the new options, covering a total of 5,021,321
shares, on May13 and June18, 2002. On May13, 2002, the Company granted new

Market on that date. The new non-employee director options are exercisable in
full on the date of grant. On June18, 2002, the Company granted new options
to its employees with an exercise price of $442 share, the closing price of
the Companys common stock on the NASDAQ National Market on that date. The new

options on the date of grant and in equal quarterly amounts thereafter for
three years.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended 1998 Restatement, as amended 1994
Plan, allows the Company to grant to its employees, officers, directors and
consultants options to purchase common stock intended to qualify as incentive

may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares. In general,
1994 Plan option grants become exercisable as to 25% on the first anniversary
of the grant date, and in equal quarterly amounts thereafter for three years.
In general, no installment is exercisable after the fourth anniversary of the
date on which such installment first becomes exercisable, and options generally
expire eight years from the grant date.
The 1994 Director Stock Option Plan, as amended Director Plan, allowed the
Company to grant non-statutory stock options to purchase common stock to
non-employee members of the Board of Directors. During 2003, the Company
terminated the Director Plan except with respect to options already granted.
The Company will no longer grant options under this plan.
The Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Officer Employee Stock Incentive Plan, as
amended 1998 Plan, allows the Company to grant non-statutory stock options,
restricted stock awards, and other stock-based awards to its employees,
consultants and advisors, other than those who are also officers within the
meaning of Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In
general, stock options granted under the 1998 Plan become exercisable as to 25%
on the first anniversary of the grant date and in equal quarterly installments
thereafter for three years. In general, no installment is exercisable after
the fourth anniversary of the date on which such installment first becomes
exercisable, and options generally expire eight years from the grant date.

Tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options were $5,485, $328 and
$15,828 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The tax benefits are allocated
directly to additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity when realized.
Cash payments for income taxes were approximately $1,749, $1,791 and $11,357 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $98,048
expiring on various dates through 2023. The Company acquired $72,655 of these
operating loss carryforwards as a result of the acquisitions that it completed
during 2001. Internal Revenue Code Section382 may limit the utilization of
the net operating losses attributable to the pre acquisition periods of
acquired
59 Table of Contents
subsidiaries. Furthermore, pre acquisition net operating losses may
not be utilizable in future years in the event of a substantial discontinuation
of the acquired business. The remainder of the net operating loss
carryforwards were generated during the year ended December31, 2003.
The valuation allowance applies to deferred tax assets relating to acquisition
related net operating loss carryforwards, where management believes that based
on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that these
assets will not be realized. Management periodically reviews the available
evidence and the valuation allowance. Tax benefits relating to the acquisition
related net operating loss carryforwards valuation allowance realized in the
future will reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible
assets which arose from the acquisitions that the Company completed during
2001.
The reconciliation between the statutory and effective income tax rates for the

For the year ended December31, 2001, the Companys effective income tax rate
is in excess of the statutory tax rate primarily due to certain expenses which
are not deductible for tax purposes, including non deductible goodwill
amortization expense and non deductible in process research and development.
12. Restructurings During 2002 and 2001, the Company evaluated and initiated restructuring actions
in order to consolidate some of its operations, enhance operational efficiency
and reduce expenses. These actions resulted in the Company recording six
separate restructuring charges based upon separate and distinct plans, the
total of which resulted in total restructuring charges of zero, $56,036 and
$19,956
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company
continues to monitor and assess its facility obligations, the real estate
market and its operating expenses.
The Company continues to monitor and assess its facility obligations, real
estate markets and operating expenses. As a result of these ongoing
assessments, during 2003 the Company revised estimates used in previously
recorded restructuring charges. These revisions resulted in no net change to
the Companys restructuring liability at December31, 2003. The Company
revised estimates of facility exit costs based upon the terms of finalized
subleases obtained during 2003, due to lower than anticipated operating costs
and other direct costs associated with certain exited facilities and due to
revisions in anticipated headcount growth. These revised estimates of facility
exit costs resulted in a net increase to facility exit costs of $774 at
December31, 2003. In addition, the Company reduced its severance
restructuring reserve by $566 at December31, 2003 when it determined its
remaining severance and other outplacement costs were lower than originally
estimated. The Company also reduced its restructuring reserve of costs
associated with the liquidation of the Companys Swedish development operations
and the sale of certain Swedish assets by $208 at December31, 2003 when it
determined the Company had no legal and consulting costs remaining in
connection with this transaction.
Restructuring charges recorded during 2002 and 2001 consist of facility exit
costs, including impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture and
fixtures, costs associated with the sale and liquidation of the Companys
Swedish development operations, and severance and other costs associated with
the reduction of employee headcount.
During the year ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $56,036, consisting of facility exit costs, costs associated with
the liquidation of the Companys Swedish development operations and the sale of
certain Swedish assets and the business related to the asset to TFS Technology
AB TFS, and severance and other costs associated with the reduction of
employee headcount. The 2002 restructuring charges include costs of $37,656
incurred due to the revision of previously recorded restructuring charges.
Included in the 2002 restructuring charges are costs of $44,014 consisting of
facility exit costs and related impairment of leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures. Facility exit costs consist of estimated shortfalls of
sublease rental income compared to obligations due under certain exited
facilities leases which are payable through 2009. The remaining unreserved
lease obligations related to certain exited facilities amount to $8,170, which
represents the Companys estimated sublease income from these facilities from
the end of the reserve period to the end of the lease term. Impairment of
leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures included in facility exit
costs are for unamortized leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures
that the Company believes will not be recoverable upon sublease of exited
facilities. Total facility exit costs for 2002 include costs of $35,718 that
the Company
60 Table of Contents
incurred when it revised estimates used in previously recorded
restructuring charges. The Company revised the estimates included in facility
exit costs due to the extension of the period of time estimated to obtain
sublease tenants for certain exited facilities, based on the terms of finalized
subleases obtained during 2002, due to higher than anticipated operating costs
associated with certain exited facilities, and due to the continued uncertainty
and deterioration in the commercial real estate and sublet markets in the
Boston metropolitan area.
The Company recorded restructuring charges of $6,318 during 2002 associated
with the liquidation of the Companys Swedish development operations and the
sale of certain Swedish assets and the business related to the assets to TFS.
The Company sold these assets and related business to TFS in exchange in part
for TFSs assumption of the liabilities related to the assets and associated
business, including the related support obligations and certain employees. The
total number of employees included in this transaction was 76, of which 67 were
employed in research and development and 9 were employed in general and
administrative functions. The total Sweden liquidation costs include costs of
$1,938 the Company incurred upon revision of estimates used in previously
recorded restructuring charges.
Also included in restructuring charges for 2002 are severance and other costs
associated with the reduction of employee headcount of $5,704 for 121
employees, of which 15 were employed in manufacturing, customer operations and
technical services, 37 were employed in research and development, 48 were
employed in sales and marketing, and 21 employed in general and administrative
functions.
During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company recorded restructuring
charges of $19,956, consisting of facility exit costs, prepaid license fees,
severance and other costs associated with the reduction of employee headcount,
and other direct costs.
Included in the 2001 restructuring
charges are costs of $9,731 consisting of
facility exit costs, related impairment of leasehold improvements and other
direct costs. Facility exit costs primarily consist of up to 18months of
minimum lease payments due under certain exited facilities lease agreements.
Impairment of leasehold improvements included in facility exit costs is for
unamortized leasehold improvements that the Company believes will not be
recoverable upon sublease of exited facilities.
Prepaid license fees of $4,350 included in 2001 restructuring charges were
expensed when it was determined that they did not have future realizable value
as a result of the Companys exiting a planned service offering.
Also included in restructuring charges for 2001 are severance and other costs
associated with the reduction of employee headcount of $5,875 for 320
employees, of which 33 were employed in manufacturing, customer operations and
technical services, 110 were employed in research and development, 110 were
employed in sales and marketing, 60 were employed in general and administrative
functions, and 7 were employed in the RSA Capital segment.

In 1999, the Company commenced and substantially completed consolidation of
certain operations in order to enhance operational efficiency. The Company
recorded facility exit costs consisting primarily of estimated shortfalls of
sublease rental income compared to minimum lease payments due under a lease
agreement. During the year ended December31, 2003 the Company revised its
estimates of these facility exit costs and reduced the reserve for these
facility exit costs to zero.
The Company expects to pay the remaining restructuring costs accrued at
December31, 2003 as follows

13. Segment Information The Company has one reportable segment, e-Security Solutions. The operations of
the e-Security Solutions segment consist of the sale of software licenses,
hardware, maintenance and professional services through two product groups,
Enterprise solutions and Developer solutions. Enterprise solutions include
sales of RSA SecurID authenticators, RSA ACE/Server software, RSA Keon
software, RSA ClearTrust software, and maintenance and professional services
associated with these products. Developer solutions include sales of RSA BSAFE
encryption software and protocol products, RSA Keon components, and maintenance
and professional services associated with these products. The segment was
determined primarily based on how management views and evaluates the Companys
operations.
Prior to January1, 2003, the Company reported two segments, e-Security
Solutions and RSA Capital. The Company has modified its segment disclosure to
reflect the divestiture of substantially all of its investments held in RSA
Capital and the reduction of resources allocated to RSA Capital. Accordingly,
the Company began reporting one segment, the e-Security Solutions segment,
after January1, 2003. The Company has revised its segment disclosure to
conform to the current period presentation.
The Companys operations are conducted throughout the world. Operations in the
United States represent more than 10% of revenue and income lossfrom
operations. The Companys operations in other countries have been grouped by
regional area below. The following tables present information about e-Security

14. Retirement and Savings Plan The Company has a 401k retirement and savings plan that allows each
participant to defer up to 20% of the participants annual earnings up to an
annual statutory maximum amount. The Company may make, at its discretion,
matching and profit-sharing contributions to the plan. Generally, matching and
profit-sharing contributions made by the Company vest annually over four years.
Matching contributions are paid in cash and were $1,412, $1,360 and $1,354 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. No profit sharing contributions were made
for 2003, 2002 and 2001.
The Company also has a non-qualified deferred compensation program which
permits key employees to annually elect to defer, for their personal income tax
purposes, a portion of their compensation for not less than three years or
until their retirement, termination, death or disability. To assist in the
financing of the funding of the deferred compensation program, the Company
invests the compensation that is withheld and deferred in Company-owned life
insurance policies. Amounts withheld and deferred for key employees under the
Companys deferred compensation program were $545, $868 and $2,445 in 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively, and are included in operating expenses.
15. Commitments The Company leases office facilities and equipment under non-cancelable

Net rent expense was approximately $11,624, $13,764 and $12,603 in 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Rent collected from existing subleases and not included
in restructuring charges was $9, $700, and $656 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.
In November 2000, the Company entered into fifteen year non-cancelable
operating leases for a new corporate headquarters facility located in Bedford,
Massachusetts and moved into these facilities in February 2002. The Company is
actively looking to sublease its
63 Table of Contents
former headquarters and other exited facilities. During 2002 and 2001, the
Company recorded restructuring charges totaling $53,426, which represent lease
obligations due through 2009 under certain excess facilities lease agreements,
net of estimated sublease rental income, impaired leasehold improvements and
furniture and fixtures for certain exited facilities, and other associated
facilities expense.
The Company is also required to pay royalties under various other licensing
agreements. Total royalty expense under all agreements was $5,375, $5,978 and
$5,538 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
16. Related Party Transactions Some of the Companys employees and directors have invested in the general
partner limited partnership of RSA Ventures including Charles R. Stuckey, Jr.
and James K. Sims, members of the Companys Board of Directors, and five former
employees including the managing director of RSA Ventures. Mr.Stuckey
invested approximately $11 in the partnership, Mr.Sims invested approximately
$7, and the five employees invested a total of approximately $70. None of
the investors has received any proceeds or been allocated any profits from this
entity since its inception, and the Company is currently in the process of
liquidating the entity. In December 2001, in connection with the Companys
reduction of the investing activities of RSA Ventures, the interest in gains
from the general partner that each of Messrs.Stuckey and Sims would be
entitled to receive in the future following a return of their invested capital
was reduced to less than one one thousandth of a percent.
In 1997, the Company entered into a license agreement with VeriSign under
which, among other things, the Company had the exclusive right to distribute
some of VeriSigns certificate authority software. The agreement also gave the
Company the right to terminate the agreement at any time if the Company paid
specified termination fees to VeriSign. Unamortized prepaid license fees were
$5,221 at December31, 2000. During the year ended December31, 2001 the
Company expensed $5,221 in prepaid license fees to cost of product revenue when
it was determined that they did not have future realizable value as a result of
the Companys acquisition of Xcert in February 2001. A former director of the
Company who is also a director of VeriSign provided consulting services to the
Company and received $60 in 2001. This consulting agreement expired in
February 2001, and the director resigned from the Companys Board of Directors
in May 2002.
17. Litigation On or about February2, 2001, Leon Stambler filed a complaint for patent
infringement in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against the
Company, VeriSign, Inc., First Data Corporation, Openwave Systems Inc., and
Omnisky Corporation, Case Number 01-0065. In his complaint, Mr.Stambler
alleged that certain products marketed by each of the defendants infringed
various patents that he owns, and he sought unspecified damages as well as a
preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from infringing
the claims asserted. The trial took place in March 2003, and the jury
determined that the Companys products did not infringe Mr.Stamblers patents.
On April17, 2003, the court entered final judgment in the Companys favor on
all claims of non-infringement. In May 2003, Mr.Stambler filed a motion asking
the court to set aside the jurys verdict, and in November 2003, the court
denied Mr.Stamblers motion. On or about December8, 2003, Mr.Stambler filed
a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals. The Company plans to
vigorously defend the appeal, and it believes that the final disposition of
this matter will not have a material adverse effect its continuing operations
and consolidated financial position.
On or about December20, 2001, France Telecom and Telediffusion de France
FT filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Court of
Arbitration. FT claims that the Company breached a license agreement with FT
and sought unspecified damages including a payment in excess of $110,000 plus
the legal fees and other costs associated with the arbitration. The arbitration
took place in June 2003, and the Company expects the arbitrator to make a
final, binding decision in the first half of 2004. The Company believes that
FTs claims are without merit. In a related matter, FT has also filed a patent
infringement suit in Delaware against Novell, Inc., one of the Companys
licensees. In August 2002, the Company signed a letter agreement with Novell
agreeing that if a court requires Novell to pay FT damages, the Company will
reimburse Novell for 50% of the damages, up to a maximum payment of $2,500 by
it. If the damages payable by Novell exceed $5,000, then the indemnification
provisions of the Companys license agreement with Novell will govern its
indemnification obligations. Although the Company believes that FTs claims
against Novell are without merit, it cannot predict the ultimate outcome of
this matter. However, the Company believes that neither the disposition of its
arbitration with FT nor the disposition of the litigation between Novell and FT
will have a material adverse effect on its continuing operations and
consolidated financial position.
From time to time, the Company has been named as a defendant in other legal
actions arising from our normal business activities, which it believes will not
have a material adverse effect on it or its business.

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer
CEO and chief financial officer CFO, evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended as
of December31, 2003. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO
concluded that as of December31, 2003, our disclosure controls and
procedures were 1designed to ensure that material information related
to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to our CEO
and CFO by others within RSA and our subsidiaries, particularly during
the period in which this report was being prepared and 2effective, in
that they provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms; but also concluded that
there are certain weaknesses in our foreign subsidiary translation
process. We have dedicated resources to correcting these issues and
have implemented the necessary corrections. These weaknesses did not
have a material impact on the accuracy of our financial statements.     
Other than the steps we have taken to correct certain weaknesses in the
foreign subsidiary translation process, no change in our internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
under the Exchange Act occurred during the year ended December31, 2003
that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 65 Table of Contents PART III
