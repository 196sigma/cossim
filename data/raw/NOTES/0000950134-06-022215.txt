See Note 3 Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements, of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.   2
The Company recorded certain adjustments to the February28, 2005 consolidated balance sheet
to reflect the cumulative effect of the restatements described in Note 3 Restatement of
Previously Issued Financial Statements, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such
adjustments related primarily to stock-based compensation expense, rent expense and income taxes. Quarterly results can be affected by a number of factors including the timing of orders,
production delays or inefficiencies, and raw materials availability.
