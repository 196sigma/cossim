For The Years Ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
NOTE 1 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Nature of Operations 
Schmitt Industries, Inc. the Company designs, manufactures, and markets computer controlled vibration detection and
balancing equipment primarily to the machine tool industry. Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., the Company designs, manufactures and markets precision laser-based surface measurement systems for the disk drive,
silicon wafer and optics industries; laser-based distance measurement and dimensional sizing products for a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications; and ultrasonic measurement products that accurately measure the fill levels of large
liquefied propane tanks and transmit that data via satellite to a secure web site. Principles of Consolidation 
These consolidated financial statements include those of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries: Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc.
SMS, Schmitt Europe, Ltd. SEL and Schmitt Industries Canada Limited. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 
Revenue Recognition The
Company recognizes revenue for sales and billing for freight charges upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed and determinable price with a reasonable assurance of collection, passage of title to the customer as indicated by shipping
terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations, pursuant to the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 605. For sales to all customers, including manufacturer representatives, distributors or their
third-party customers, these criteria are met at the time product is shipped. When other significant obligations remain after products are delivered, revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled. In addition, judgments are
required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers. Credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that collectability is reasonably assured. 
Cash Equivalents The
Company generally invests excess cash in money market funds and investment grade highly liquid securities. The Company considers securities that are highly liquid, readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of less than three months
when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Companys cash consists of demand deposits in large financial institutions. At times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. 
Short-Term Investments 
At both May31, 2010 and 2009, short-term investments were $0. The carrying amount of short-term investments is stated at cost, which
approximates fair market value because of their short maturities. There were no related unrealized holding gains or losses at May31, 2010 and 2009.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
Accounts Receivable 
The Company maintains credit limits for all customers based upon several factors, including but not limited to payment history, published
credit reports and use of credit references. Management performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances to ensure recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value. This review includes using accounts receivable agings,
other operating trends and relevant business conditions, including general economic factors, as they relate to each of the Companys domestic and international customers. If these analyses lead management to the conclusion that potential
significant accounts are uncollectible, a reserve is provided. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $23,387 and $38,233 as of May31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Inventory Inventory is
valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the average cost basis. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead, which are related to the purchase or production of inventories. Write-downs,
when required, are made to reduce excess inventories to their net realizable values. Such estimates are based on assumptions regarding future demand and market conditions. If actual conditions become less favorable than the assumptions used, an
additional inventory write-down may be required. As of May31, 2010 and 2009, inventories consisted of:  May31,2010
May31,2009
Raw materials 1,070,902 1,525,618
Work-in-process 980,971 730,609
Finished goods 1,593,430 1,610,744 3,645,303 3,866,971 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of three to
seven years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment; three years for vehicles; and twenty-five years for buildings and improvements. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
Financial statements for the Companys subsidiaries outside the United States are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange
rates for assets and liabilities and weighted average exchange rates for income and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity titled Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in net income loss. Advertising 
Advertising costs included in general, administrative and selling, are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising
expense was $56,463, $82,512 and $107,539 for the fiscal years ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
Research and Development Costs 
Research and development costs, predominately internal labor costs and costs of materials, are charged to expense when incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation includes expense charges for all stock-based awards to employees and directors granted under the Companys
stock option plan. The Company has adopted ASC Topic 718, which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors including stock options based on estimated fair values. 
Stock-based compensation recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the stock-based award that will vest during
the period, adjusted for expected forfeitures. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is recognized using the straight-line method. 
Income Taxes The
Company applies the asset and liability method in recording income taxes, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined, based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using currently enacted tax rates and laws. Additionally, deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
Company currently has a valuation allowance against all of their net deferred tax assets. Management continues to review the level of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that the Companys future operations
will produce sufficient earnings so that the deferred tax asset can be fully utilized. Intangible Assets 
Amortizable intangible assets, purchased technology and patents, are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to
seventeen years. As of May31, 2010 and 2009, amortizable intangible assets were $2,200,883 and $2,085,363 and accumulated amortization was $697,212 and $542,669, respectively. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $162,000 in
Fiscal 2011 and 2012, $129,000 in Fiscal 2013, $128,000 in Fiscal 2014 and $113,000 in Fiscal 2015. Intangible and other
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the forecasted future net cash flows from the
operations to which the assets relate, based on managements best estimates using the appropriate assumptions and projections at the time, to the carrying amount of the assets. If the carrying value is determined to be in excess of future
operating cash flows, the asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. As of May31, 2010, management did not believe impairment, as
defined above, existed. Earnings Loss Per Share 
Basic earnings loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings loss per
share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares 
28  Schmitt Industries, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
outstanding, adjusted for dilutive incremental shares attributed to outstanding options to purchase common stock. Common stock equivalents for stock options are computed using the treasury stock
method. In periods in which a net loss is incurred, no common stock equivalents are included since they are antidilutive and as such all stock options outstanding are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss in those periods. 78,241 and
86,187 potentially dilutive common shares from outstanding stock options have been excluded from diluted earnings loss per share for the years ended May31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk are trade accounts receivable. Credit terms
generally include a discount of 15% if the invoice is paid within ten days, with the net amount payable in 30 days. Financial Instruments
The carrying value of all other financial instruments potentially subject to valuation risk principally consisting of
cash and cash equivalents, short term investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable also approximate fair value because of their short-term maturities. 
Shipping and Handling Charges 
The Company incurs costs related to shipping and handling of its manufactured products. These costs are expensed as incurred as a
component of cost of sales. Shipping and handling charges related to the receipt of raw materials are also incurred, which are recorded as a cost of the related inventory. 
Use of Estimates The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the
Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a Replacement of FASB Statement No162, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification or ASC as the source of
authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP recognized by FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under authority
of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. On the effective date of this guidance, the Codification superseded all then-existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. All other non-grandfathered
non-SEC accounting literature not included in the codification will become non-authoritative. The Company adopted ASC Topic 105 in the second quarter of Fiscal 2010. The adoption of ASC Topic 105 did not have a material impact on the Companys
financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations,
which was incorporated into the Codification with ASC Topic 805 Business Combinations This guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial
statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any controlling interest; 
29  Schmitt Industries, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial
statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This guidance is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after May31, 2009. 
In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No 165, Subsequent Events. The provisions of this standard were incorporated into the
Codification with ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events. This guidance is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available
to be issued. This guidance is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after June15, 2009. The Company has adopted this guidance. 
NOTE 2 LINE OF CREDIT
In February 2009, the Company renewed its $10 million bank line of credit agreement secured by U.S. accounts receivable,
inventories and general intangibles which expires on March1, 2011. Interest is payable at the banks prime rate 325% as of May31, 2010 or LIBOR plus 20%, 235% as of May31, 2010. There were no outstanding balances on the
line of credit at May31, 2010 and 2009. NOTE 3 
LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS As
of May31, 2010, there were no outstanding obligations under capital leases or purchase contracts. The Company leases certain facilities and equipment to support operations under non-cancelable operating leases and other contractual
obligations. Total rent expense for the years ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $36,348, $36,394 and $32,370, respectively. 
The approximate future minimum commitments under leases and contractual obligations for each of the years ending May31 are as
follows:  Years ending May 31 2011 28,250
2012 1,788
2013 1,788

that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company has recorded a substantial deferred tax asset related to temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. During Fiscal 2010, the Company
increased its valuation allowance $665,025 as a result of the write-down of deferred tax assets. During Fiscal 2009, the Company increased its valuation allowance $903,091 as a result of the write-down of deferred tax assets. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease of $694,696 due to the expiration of the related capital losses. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets as the recent losses have been given more weight than
projected future income when determining the need for a valuation allowance. The Company has federal net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $17 million which expire in 2029 and 2030 along with the federal general business and other credit carryforwards. The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $25 million which expire in
2024 and 2025. The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the U.S.
statutory federal tax rate to pre-tax income loss due to the following:  Years ended May31 2010 2009 2008 Statutory federal tax rate

Each year the Company files income tax returns in the various federal, state and local
income taxing jurisdictions in which it operates. These tax returns are subject to examination and possible challenge by the taxing authorities. Positions challenged by the taxing authorities may be settled or appealed by the Company. As a result,
there is an uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the Companys financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 740. The Company applies this guidance by defining criteria that an individual income tax position must meet for any part of
the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprises financial statements and provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, accounting for interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
transition. On June1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 740. The adoption of ASC Topic 740 resulted
in a $34,464 decrease in the Companys liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the June1, 2007 retained earnings balance. At June1, 2007, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was
approximately $586,000, which included approximately $150,000 of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce the Companys effective income tax rate. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company completed an
examination of its federal tax returns for the years ended May31, 2005 through 2007. The Company recognized tax benefits of approximately $150,000 including interest and penalties during Fiscal 2009. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized income tax benefits is as follows: 2010
2009 2008 Balance at beginning of year 450,833 489,599 Decrease for tax positions taken payment of tax 38,766 Decrease for tax positions settled 450,833 Balance at end of year 450,833 Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as components of the
Provision for income taxes. The Companys accrual for interest and penalties was $96,500 upon adoption of ASC Topic 740. The liability for interest and penalties decreased to $0 due to the completion of the federal examination. The
liability for payment of interest and penalties was $0 as of May31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Several tax years are
subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. In the United States, federal tax years for Fiscal 2007 and after are subject to examination. In the United Kingdom, tax years for Fiscal 2006 and after are subject to examination. In Canada, tax
years for 2005 and after are subject to examination. In the United States, returns related to an acquired subsidiary for the year ended October31, 1994 and final return for the period ended May19, 1995 are also subject to examination.
NOTE 5 COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES In a transaction related to the acquisition of Schmitt Measurement Systems, Inc., formerly TMA Technologies,
Inc. TMA, the Company established a royalty pool and vested in each shareholder and debt holder of the acquired company an interest in the royalty pool equal to the amount invested or loaned including interest payable through March
1995. The royalty pool is funded at 5% of net sales defined as gross sales less returns, allowances and sales commissions of the Companys surface measurement products and future derivative products developed by Schmitt Industries, Inc.,
which utilize these technologies. As part of the royalty

For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
pool agreement, each former shareholder and debt holder released TMA from any claims with regard to the acquisition except their rights to future royalties. Royalty expense applicable to the
years ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to $16,358, $19,352 and $47,344, respectively. NOTE 6 
SEGMENT INFORMATION The

STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
The Board of Directors adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan 2004 Plan in August 2004 and the 1995 Stock Option Plan 1995 Plan in
December 1995, which plan was amended in August 1996 and restated in August 1998. An option granted under the 2004 Plan and/or 1995 Plan the Plans might be either an incentive stock option ISO, or a nonstatutory stock option NSO. ISOs may be
granted only to employees and members of the Board of Directors of the Company and are subject to certain limitations, in addition to restrictions applicable to all stock options under the Plan. Options not meeting these limitations will be treated
as NSOs. The purchase price of ISOs is fair market value on the date of grant; the purchase price of NSOs may vary from fair market value. Vesting is at the discretion of the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, but is either 50% at
grant date and 167% on each anniversary thereafter or 25% at grant date and 25% on each anniversary thereafter. The Company initially reserved 400,000 shares for issuance under the 1995 Plan and 300,000 shares for issuance under the 2004 Plan. The
1995 Plan expired in December 2005 and no additional options may be issued under the 1995 Plan, although expiration of the 1995 Plan did not affect the rights of persons who received stock grants under the 1995 Plan. Stock-based compensation
recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 includes compensation cost for stock-based awards granted prior to, but not fully vested as of, May31, 2006. All
outstanding options will expire no later than 2018. Upon adoption of ASC Topic 718, the Company continued to use the
Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method of valuation for stock-based awards. The Companys determination of the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well
as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Although the fair value of stock-based awards is determined in accordance with ASC Topic 718, the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of
34  Schmitt Industries, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsContinued 
For The Years Ended May 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 
highly subjective assumptions, and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results. These variables include, but are not limited to:  Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an
equivalent remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the award.  Expected Life. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company
determines the expected life based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeitures.  Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its
common stock. The volatility factor the Company uses is based on its historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the award. These historical periods may exclude portions of time when unusual
transactions occurred.  Expected Dividend Yield. The Company does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an
expected dividend yield of zero.  Expected Forfeitures. The Company uses relevant historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures. The Company records stock-based
compensation only for those awards that are expected to vest. The Company has computed, to determine
stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended May31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the value of all stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by ASC Topic 718 using the following assumptions:

NOTE 11 ACQUISITIONS 
Optical Dimensions On
September30, 2009, the Company completed an Asset Purchase Agreement the Agreement with Optical Dimensions, a sole proprietorship, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
Optical Dimensions. As a result, the Company now owns and operates Optical Dimensions business, including its patented laser light scatter roughness measurement technology. The total purchase price for the acquisition was $200,293 which
includes the value of the shares issued and the cash paid. The Agreement provided that the Company pay cash of $100,000 and issue 24,642 shares of common stock of the Company. The number of shares issued was equal to $100,000 of value based on the
average closing price of the Companys common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ National Market, over the five-day period immediately prior to closing. Based upon the closing price on September30, 2009, as reported on the NASDAQ Capital
Market, the aggregate non-cash value of the Companys 24,642 shares issued was $100,293. The following table summarizes
the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:  Tangible assets and liabilities assumed Receivables 33,434 Inventory 40,000 Property and equipment 17,757 Prepaid expenses 2,955 Accounts payable 9,374 Intangible assets Purchased technology 115,521 200,293 The allocation process requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including technologies,
customer contracts and relationships and trade names, and liabilities assumed, including contractual commitments and legal contingencies. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based upon information
available as November30, 2009, and may be adjusted as further information becomes available. Additional information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and liabilities
includes, but is not limited to, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations and the amounts required to settle them. Any changes in the values allocated to tangible and specifically identified intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed during the allocation period may result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Purchased technology
relates to Optical Dimensions patented laser light scatter roughness measurement technology that has reached technological feasibility. The fair value of the purchased technology is being amortized over the expected useful life of five years.

Xtero Datacom Inc 
On February20, 2008, the Company, through its newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Schmitt Industries Canada Limited, a British
Columbia corporation SICL, acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Xtero Datacom Inc., a British Columbia corporation Xtero. As consideration for the Xtero shares, the Company issued 199,977 shares of
Company common stock to the Xtero shareholders. In addition, Xtero shareholders will be eligible to receive shares of SICL stock that are exchangeable for shares of Schmitt common stock on a one-for-one basis based on 50% of the after-tax earnings
derived from Xtero products during a five-year earn-out program ending on May31, 2013. The issuance of the 199,977 shares was not registered, and was made with reliance upon Section3a 10of the Securities Act of 1933 the Act,
which exempts judicially approved share exchanges from the Acts registration requirements. On January29, 2008, the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted a final order approving the transaction. Based upon the closing price of the
Companys common stock of $590 on February20, 2008 as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the aggregate value of the Companys 199,977 shares issued to the Xtero shareholders was approximately $1,179,865. The aggregate purchase
price for the acquisition was $1,797,367 which includes the value of shares issued, advances of $500,000 to Xtero prior to February20, 2008 on a convertible promissory note and other transaction costs. 
The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:
Tangible assets and liabilities assumed Receivables 182,000 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 248,657 Deferred tax liabilities 842,280 Intangible assets Purchased technology 2,706,304 1,797,367 The allocation process requires an analysis and valuation of acquired assets, including deferred tax assets,
technologies, customer contracts and relationships, trade names and liabilities assumed, including contractual commitments and legal contingencies. The values assigned to certain acquired assets and liabilities are preliminary, are based on
information available as of May31, 2008, and may be adjusted as further information becomes available. Additional information that may become available subsequently and may result in changes in the values allocated to various assets and
liabilities includes, but is not limited to, unidentified claims from suppliers or other contingent obligations, the amounts required to settle them, and the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any changes in the values allocated to
tangible and specifically identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the allocation period may result in adjustments to intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company filed tax returns in Canada
related to this acquisition which resulted in changes to the preliminary values assigned to the deferred tax liabilities and the intangible asset. Based on the tax return filings and elections available to treat the Xtero acquisition as a purchase
of assets for tax purposes, the tax basis of the underlying assets was increased which eliminated the deferred tax liability originally recognized at the acquisition date. As a result of the elimination of the deferred tax liability originally
recorded, the value of the intangible asset decreased to $1,663,539. Purchased technology relates to Xteros remote
satellite sensing of large chemical storage tanks that have reached technological feasibility. The fair value of the purchased technology is being amortized over the original useful life of 15 years.

Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management,
including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have
concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over
financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f or 15d-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls
over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Controls Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of May31, 2010. 
This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal
control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report
in the annual report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f that
occurred during the quarter ended May31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B.
