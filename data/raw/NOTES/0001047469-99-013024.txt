The Board of Directors and Stockholders,
DAOU Systems, Inc.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of DAOU Systems, Inc. as of 
December 31, 1998 and 1997 and the related consolidated statements of 
operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1998. Our audits also include the financial 
statement schedule listed in the index of item 14a. These consolidated 
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company 
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated 
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the balance sheet 
of Sentient Systems, Inc. as of December 31, 1997 or the related statements 
of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, which statements reflect total assets of 6% as of 
December 31, 1997 of the related consolidated financial statement totals and 
which reflect net income constituting 28% and 22% of the related consolidated 
financial statement totals for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996. 
These statements were audited by other auditors whose report has been 
furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to Sentient Systems, 
Inc., is based solely on the report of other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of DAOU Systems, Inc. at
December 31, 1998 and 1997 and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion the 
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the 
basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material 
respects the information set forth therein.                 ERNST & YOUNG LLP

29 1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
DAOU Systems, Inc. DAOU or the Company provides integrated information
technology IT solutions and services to the U.S. healthcare industry. DAOU
capabilities range from up-front strategic consulting to IT system design,
implementation and long-term tactical support. DAOU information technology
offerings include Application Implementation, Communications Infrastructure,
Management Consulting and Integration Services. The Company Application
Implementations Group supplies staffing resources to hospitals and other
healthcare organizations. DAOU vendor certified consultants are capable of
installing nearly 90% of the most common healthcare applications. The Company
Communications Infrastructure group focuses on the information superstructure in
healthcare enterprises, including networking, Intranet and Internet, desktop,
and voice, video and data solutions. Management Consulting develops business
plans and solves problems for healthcare IT managers, installs and integrates
applications, engineers, installs and integrates infrastructure, and manages IT
systems. DAOU Integration Services Group analyzes, implements and supports
information systems that meet a customer business objectives and reduce the
cost and improve the quality of care.
In March 1998, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Synexus Incorporated Synexus and Sentient Systems, Inc. Sentient through
the Company wholly-owned subsidiaries DAOU-Synexus, Inc. and DAOU-Sentient,
Inc. In June 1998, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares
of Technology Management, Inc. and Affiliate and Resources in Healthcare
Innovations, Inc. and Affiliates, through the Company wholly-owned
subsidiaries DAOU-TMI, Inc. and DAOU-RHI, Inc. The above acquisitions were
accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting and,
accordingly, the consolidated financial statements reflect the combined
financial position and operating results for the Company, Synexus, Sentient,
Technology Management, Inc. and Affiliate, and Resources in Healthcare
Innovations and Affiliates for all periods presented giving retroactive effect
to the pooling transactions. All significant intercompany accounts have been
eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Contract revenue for the development and implementation of network solutions
under fixed-fee contracts is recognized using the percentage-of-completion
method with progress to completion measured by labor costs incurred to date
compared to total estimated labor costs. Provisions for estimated losses on
contracts, if any, are made during the period when the loss becomes probable and
can be reasonably estimated. Revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed and
project costs are classified as contract work in progress. Revenue from
technical support and network management services is recognized as the services
are performed. Payments received in advance of services performed are recorded
as deferred revenue and amortized as the services are performed.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMER
Substantially all of the Company accounts receivable are from hospitals and
other healthcare providers. Generally, the Company obtains a significant deposit
from its customers upon signing a contract and collateral is not required. The
Company provides for losses from uncollectible accounts and such losses have
historically not exceeded management expectations. No customer accounted for
more than 10% of the Company revenues in any period presented. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company has established
guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that are periodically
reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
The Company historically has not experienced any material losses on its cash
equivalents or short-term investments.
The Company classifies its short-term investments as Available-for-Sale and
records such assets at the estimated fair value on the balance sheet with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity until realized. The basis for computing
realized gains or losses is by specific identification.  
30 1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE AND FIXTURES
Equipment, furniture and fixtures are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
about the future that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and disclosures made in the accompanying notes of the financial statements. The
actual results could differ from those estimates.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Net income loss per share are computed in accordance with FASB Statement No.
128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. Basic net income loss per share are computed using
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted net income loss per share includes the dilutive effect of common
shares potentially issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants. In
1998, diluted loss per share is unchanged from basic loss per share because the
effects of the assumed conversion of stock options and warrants would be
anti-dilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of the shares used in the basic
and diluted net income loss per share calculation IN THOUSANDS                                          DECEMBER 31,

Shares used in Diluted net income loss per share        17,657       17,246     14,385
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES APB 25, and related interpretations
in accounting for its employee and director stock options because the
alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING
FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSTATION SFAS 123, requires the use of option valuation
models that were not developed for use in valuing employee and director stock
options. Under SFAS 123, compensation cost is determined using the fair value of
stock-based compensation determined as of the grant date, and is recognized over
the periods in which the related services are rendered. If companies elect to
continue using the current implicit value accounting method specified in APB 25
to account for stock-based compensation, they must disclose in the notes to the
financial statements the pro forma effect of using the fair value method for its
stock-based compensation.  
31 1.  ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, REPORTING
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME and SFAS No. 131, SEGMENT INFORMATION. SFAS No. 130
requires that all components of comprehensive income, including net income, be
reported in the financial statements in the period in which they are recognized.
Comprehensive income is defined as the change in equity during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net
income and other comprehensive income, including foreign currency translation
adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments, is reported, net of
their related tax effect, to arrive at comprehensive income. SFAS No. 131 amends
the requirements for public enterprises to report financial and descriptive
information about its reportable operating segments. Operating segments, as
defined in SFAS No. 131, are components of an enterprise for which separate
financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Company in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The financial
information is required to be reported on the basis that is used internally for
evaluating the segment performance. The Company believes it operates in one
business and operating segment, which is healthcare IT services.

outstanding stock of each of these companies. The above acquisitions have been
accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method of accounting, and

consummation of the combinations have been restated as though the companies had
been combined for all periods presented.

of Virginia. Integrex specializes in voice and video networks and also designs
integrated cable plants capable of supporting voice, video and high-speed data
transmission.  
32 2.  ACQUISITIONS CONTINUED
Both the Integrex and On-Line acquisitions were accounted for using the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting and, accordingly, the historical
financial statements for all periods prior to the consummation of the

5.  LINES OF CREDIT
The Company has a line of credit for $700,000, which expires on May 1, 1999.
Under the terms of the agreement, advances bear interest at the bank prime
rate plus 025% 800% at December 31, 1998 per annum. There are no
compensating balance requirements and borrowings under the line of credit are
limited to 65% of qualifying receivables. At December 31, 1998, $670,000 was
outstanding under the line of credit.
During June 1998, the Company secured two borrowing facilities, a $20 
million revolving line of credit, under which none is available for future 
borrowings at December 31, 1998, and an additional $8,000,000 line of credit, 
under which $60 million is available for future borrowings at December 31, 
1998. Advances under both lines bear interest at the bank prime rate plus 
025% 80% at December 31, 1998 per annum. These lines of credit expire 
July 31, 1999, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company 
and contain customary covenants and restrictions. As of December 31, 1998, 
the Company was not in compliance with one of the covenants and has been 
informed by the bank that the Company cannot avail itself to the unused lines 
of credit. Management is actively negotiating for a replacement line of 
credit, believes that a replacement line will be obtained before expiration 
of the existing line of credit and that the Company has sufficient liquidity 
to fund operations until this new line is in place. 
Interest expense for the above lines of credit for years ended December 31,
1998, 1997 and 1996 was approximately $216,000, $43,000 and $16,000,
respectively.  
34 6.  COMMITMENTS
LEASE COMMITMENTS
The Company leases its facilities and certain equipment under operating lease
agreements. The facility leases provide for abatement of rent during certain
periods and escalating rent payments during the lease term. Rent expense for
1998, 1997 and 1996 totaled approximately $1,665,000, $1,187,000 and $1,122,000,

7.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
STOCK OFFERINGS
In February 1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of its common
stock. The offering raised net proceeds to the Company of approximately $158
million. In August 1997, the Company completed a secondary offering of common
stock in which the Company raised net proceeds of approximately $93 million.
REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK
During 1995, 1,603,430 shares of redeemable preferred stock were issued at $499
per share for proceeds of $7,618,000, net of issuance costs. Holders of the
redeemable preferred stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the
rate of $003 per share per annum, when and if declared by the Board of
Directors and prior to any dividends on the common stock. The redeemable
preferred stock had a liquidation preference of $499 per share plus any
declared but unpaid dividends and was convertible at the option of the holder
into one share of common stock, subject to certain antidilution adjustments. The
shares of preferred stock were automatically converted into shares of common
stock in connection with the initial public offering of the Company common
stock, which closed in February 1997. The increase in the redemption value of
the redeemable preferred stock was $87,000 in 1995 and $485,000 in 1996.  
35 7.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
STOCK OPTION PLANS
During 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Plan, under
which 947,025 shares of the Company common stock were initially reserved for
issuance upon exercise of options granted by the Company. During November 1996,
the Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders approved an amendment to the
Plan, which increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan
to 1,367,925. In May 1998, the Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders
approved an amendment to the Plan, which increased the number of shares reserved
for issuance under the Plan to 4,000,000 shares. The Plan provides for the grant
of both incentive and nonstatutory stock options to officers, directors,
employees and consultants of the Company. Options granted by the Company
generally vest over a three to five-year period and are exercisable for a period
of ten years from the date of the grant.
The Company recorded $1,243,000 of deferred compensation for options granted
during the year ended December 31, 1996, representing the difference between the
option exercise price and the deemed fair value for financial statement
presentation purposes. From January through May 1998, the Company recorded
$385,000 of deferred compensation related to options granted with exercise
prices below the fair market value on the date of the increase in the number of
shares reserved for issuance under the Plan was approved by the shareholders.
The Company is amortizing the deferred compensation ratably over the vesting
period of the options.

At December 31, 1998, options for 633,694 common shares were available for
future grant.
Adjusted pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996: risk-free interest rate of 506%, 6% and
6%, respectively; dividend yield of 0% for all years; volatility factors of the
expected market price of the Company common stock of 75%, 75% and 0 respectively; and a weighted-average expected life of the options of five, seven
and seven years, respectively.
The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do no necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its employee stock options. For purposes of adjusted pro
forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to
expense over the vesting period of the options. The Company adjusted pro forma
information is as follows IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE INFORMATION                              YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Approximately $630,000 of the net operating losses included in the above

have been allocated directly to additional paid-in capital.
At December 31, 1998, the Company has federal and state net operating loss 
carryforwards of approximately $5,455,000 and $6,499,000, respectively. The 
federal and state loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2013 and 2003, 
respectively, unless previously utilized.
Under sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, the annual use of 
the Company net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in the event of 
a cumulative change in ownership of more that 50%. However, the Company does 
not believe such a limitation will have a material impact on the ultimate 
utilization of these carryforwards.

The Company sponsors the DAOU Systems, Inc. 401k Salary Savings Plan which 
covers employees who meet certain age and service requirements. Employees may 
contribute a portion of their earnings each plan year subject to certain 
Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company made elective contributions 
to the Plan of $98,000, $13,000 and $16,000 for the years ended December 31, 
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
In October 1994, Integrex adopted a retirement benefit plan effective January 
1, 1995. The plan is intended to qualify under Internal Revenue Code Section 
401a and provides for employee salary deferrals under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 401k, company matching payments, and company profit sharing 
payments. Integrex made profit sharing payments of $44,572 and $97,605 for 
the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Effective January 
1, 1998, Integrex employees became eligible to participate in the Company 
401k plan, and the existing profit sharing plan of Integrex was terminated.
In December 1995, On-Line adopted a defined contribution profit sharing plan 
covering substantially all employees who have completed one year of service 
and are twenty-one years of age and older. Profit sharing contributions are 
made at the discretion of On-Line management. Contributions vest 20% after 
two years and an additional 20% for each year thereafter. Profit sharing 
expense was $67,500 and $77,124 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 
1996, respectively. Effective January 1, 1998, On-Line employees became 
eligible to participate in the Company 401k plan, and the existing profit 
sharing plan of On-Line was terminated.
Sentient formerly had an employee stock purchase plan available to certain 
employees of Sentient. During 1994, the Board of Directors discontinued 
issuance of new shares under the plan. During 1996, Sentient purchased and 
retired all 36,329 shares held by employees at approximately $109 per share. 
Concurrently with the repurchase of the shares, each employee holding stock 
was issued an equivalent number of nontransferable share units. These share 
units entitle the holder, upon termination of employment or other liquidating 
event, to a payment equal to the increase in the book value per share of 
Sentient between the most recent audited financial statements at the 
liquidating event date and the most recent audited financial statements prior 
to the issuance of the share units, multiplied by the number of share units 
held. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, 30,445 and 35,991 share units, 
respectively, were outstanding. In the event of an initial public offering of 
its common stock or a change in control, the holders are entitled to receive 
the difference between the fair market value of the share units based on the 
consideration involved and the book value per share per the most recent 
audited financial statements. As a result of the acquisition, the share units 
were retired and a cash payment was made to the holders of the share units 
based upon the stock appreciation as valued at the time of acquisition. The 
Company recorded $7,139 and $13,642 of expense associated with these share 
units in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
Sentient has a 401k savings plan available to employees who have completed 
at least 1,000 hours of service. Matching contributions to the plan are at 
the Company discretion. The Company made matching contributions to the plan 
for 1998, 1997 and 1996 of approximately $114,000, $84,000 and $62,000, 
respectively.
TMI maintains a defined contribution profit sharing plan for all eligible 
employees. Contributions are discretionary and are made solely by the 
Company. Actual contributions are based on a formula applied to each 
participant annual compensation. Contribution expense for the plan was 
approximately $112,000, $89,000 and $74,000 for the years ended December 31, 
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  
39 9.  BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED
RHI has a 401k savings plan available to employees who have completed 6 
months of eligible service and are 21 years of age or older. Employees can 
voluntarily contribute up to 10% of their gross salaries, subject to IRS 
limitations. Matching contributions to the plan are at the Company 
discretion. The Company made matching contributions to the plan of $147,000, 
$100,000 and $50,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, 
respectively.
10. CONTINGENCIES
On August 24, 1998, August 31, 1998, September 14, 1998 and 
September 23, 1998, separate complaints were filed against the Company and 
certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for 
the Southern District of California. A group of shareholders has been 
appointed the lead plaintiffs and they filed an amended consolidated 
complaint on February 24, 1999. The new complaint realleges the same theory 
of liability previously asserted, namely the alleged improper use of the 
percentage-of-completion accounting method for revenue recognition. These 
complaints were brought on behalf of a purported class of investors in the 
Company Common Stock and do not allege specific damage amounts. In 
addition, on October 7, 1998 and October 15, 1998, separate complaints were 
filed in the Superior Court of San Diego, California. These additional 
complaints mirror the allegations set forth in the federal complaints and 
assert common law fraud and the violation of certain California statutes. By 
stipulation of the parties, the state court litigation has been stayed 
pending the resolution of a motion to dismiss that will be filed on April 22, 
1999 in the federal litigation. The Company believes that the allegations set 
forth in all of the foregoing complaints are without merit and intends to 
defend against these allegations vigorously. No assurance as to the outcome 
of this matter can be given, however, and an unfavorable resolution of this 
matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, 
results of operations and financial condition.
