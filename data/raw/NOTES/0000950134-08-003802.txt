Item8 Financial Statements in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Capital Expenditures Attributable to Compliance with Environmental Regulations. In 2007, our
capital expenditures attributable to compliance with environmental regulations were $614million,
and are currently estimated to be approximately $575million for 2008 and approximately $665
million for 2009. The estimates for 2008 and 2009 do not include amounts related to capital
investments at our facilities that management has deemed to be strategic investments rather than
expenditures relating to environmental regulatory compliance. PROPERTIES Our principal properties are described above under the caption Valeros Operations, and that
information is incorporated herein by reference. We also own feedstock and refined product storage
facilities in various locations. We believe that our properties and facilities are generally
adequate for our operations and that our facilities are maintained in a good state of repair. As
of December31, 2007, we were the lessee under a number of cancelable and non-cancelable leases for
certain properties. Our leases are discussed more fully in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Our patents relating to our refining operations are not material to us as a whole. The trademarks
and tradenames under which we conduct our retail and branded wholesale business - including
Valero, Diamond Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar,
Beacon, Corner Store, and Stop N Go - and other
trademarks
employed in the marketing of petroleum products are integral to our wholesale and retail marketing
operations. 13 Table of Contents EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

Other Litigation Environmental Enforcement Matters While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any
one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on
our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are reporting these proceedings
to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings
arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will
result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. United States Department of Justice DOJ/ United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA
Corpus Christi West Refinery. The DOJ proposed a penalty of $24million to resolve alleged
violations of the Clean Water Act resulting from an oil spill at our Corpus Christi West Refinery
in June2006. We are pursuing settlement of this matter with the DOJ and EPA. United States of America, et al. v. The Premcor Refining Group Inc., et al., United States District
Court, Western District of Texas Civil Action No.SA07CA0683RF, August16, 2007. In the past
several years, the EPA issued to a majority of refiners operating in the United States a series of
information requests pursuant to Section114 of the Clean Air Act as part of the EPAs National
Petroleum Refinery Initiative Initiative to reduce air emissions. Three refineries that we
acquired in the Premcor Acquisition the Port Arthur, Memphis, and Lima Refineries had received
information requests as part of this Initiative the Delaware City Refinery was already subject to
a separate Section114 settlement. In August2007, we reached an Initiative settlement with the
EPA and the DOJ covering these three refineries. In the fourth quarter of 2007, a consent decree
fully resolving this matter was entered in federal court. Bay Area Air Quality Management District BAAQMD Benicia Refinery. In 2005, the BAAQMD issued
25 violation notices VNs for various incidents at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant,
including alleged excess emissions, recordkeeping discrepancies, and other matters. In the fourth
quarter of 2007, we settled 24 of these VNs. We do not believe that the remaining 2005 VN will
result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. In 2006, the BAAQMD issued 22 VNs, and in 2007,
the BAAQMD issued 30 VNs for these facilities containing allegations similar to the 2005 VNs. We
are pursuing settlement of the 2006 and 2007 VNs and the one remaining VN from 2005. Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control DDNREC Delaware City
Refinery. On October11, 2007, the DDNREC issued a notice of violation NOVto our Delaware City
Refinery alleging unauthorized emissions and failure to report emissions from the refinerys frozen
earth storage unit. We are pursuing settlement of this matter. 15 Table of Contents Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board LARWQCB Wilmington Marine Terminal. In
December2007, as part of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit renewal
process for our Wilmington marine terminal, the LARWQCB issued an NOV and Request for Information.
The NOV alleges violations of acute toxicity effluent limits between 2000 and 2006 and reporting
violations between 2001 and 2005. We are currently pursuing settlement of this NOV. New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection NJDEP Paulsboro Refinery. We were subject to
17 air-related Administrative Order and Notice of Civil Administrative Penalty Assessments
Notices issued by the NJDEP in 2005 and 2006 relating to our Paulsboro Refinery. Additionally,
in March2007, the NJDEP issued a Notice to our Paulsboro Refinery alleging unauthorized air
emissions and late reporting regarding a release and flaring event that occurred in February2007.
We are pursuing settlement of these Notices. People of the State of Illinois, ex rel. v. The Premcor Refining Group Inc., et al., Third Judicial
Circuit Court, Madison County Case No03-CH-00459, filed May29, 2003 Hartford refinery and
terminal. The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Illinois EPA has issued several NOVs
alleging violations of air and waste regulations at Premcors Hartford, Illinois terminal and
now-closed refinery. We are negotiating the terms of a consent order for corrective action. South Coast Air Quality Management District SCAQMD Wilmington Refinery. In 2007, the SCAQMD
issued nine NOVs for various alleged violations at our Wilmington Refinery and asphalt plant
including excess emissions, recordkeeping discrepancies, and other matters. We are currently
pursuing settlement of the NOVs. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality TCEQ McKee Refinery. We received a proposed Agreed
Order from the TCEQ for $115,728 on November26, 2007, to resolve three outstanding notices of
enforcement pertaining to alleged violations of state and federal air regulations at our McKee
Refinery. We are currently in settlement discussions with the TCEQ to resolve this matter. TCEQ Port Arthur Refinery. In September2005, we received two enforcement actions from the TCEQ
relating to alleged Texas Clean Air Act violations at the Port Arthur Refinery dating back to 2002.
The TCEQ had originally proposed penalties of $880,240 for these events. In 2007, these
enforcement actions were referred to the Texas Attorney Generals office and consolidated with TCEQ
Docket No2005-1596-AIR-E, which assessed an additional penalty of $130,563. The Texas Attorney
General has made a demand of $4million to resolve these matters. The federal consent decree
related to the Section114 Initiative described above see United States of America, et al. v. The
Premcor Refining Group, Inc., et al. proposes to resolve the violations addressed by the TCEQs
enforcement actions. We are in discussions with the Texas Attorney General to clarify what, if
any, remaining issues must be resolved. TCEQ Texas City Refinery. On July11, 2007, we received a Notice of Enforcement from the TCEQ
for excess air emissions that began in 2005 at our Texas City Refinery relating to a partially open
flare valve. On September25, 2007, the TCEQ issued a proposed Agreed Order with a proposed
administrative penalty of $228,900. We settled this matter with the TCEQ in the fourth quarter of
2007. Item1B.

31, 2007 and describe some of the primary factors that we believe affected our results of
operations during the year. Although we reported strong earnings from continuing operations for
2007, they decreased from comparable earnings reported in 2006. We reported income from continuing
operations of $46billion, or $772 per share, for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to
$53billion, or $836 per share, for the year ended December31, 2006. Our profitability is
substantially determined by the spread between the price of refined products and the price of crude
oil, referred to as the refined product margin. Gasoline and distillate margins in 2007 improved
compared to such margins in 2006 primarily due to supply limitations caused by industry-wide
refinery downtime, both planned and unplanned, lower imports into the United States, and tighter
product specifications. However, rapidly rising crude oil prices resulted in lower margins for
certain of our secondary products, such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum coke, and sulfur, the
prices of which did not increase nearly as much as the cost of the feedstocks used to produce them. In addition, our contribution to earnings resulting from processing sour crude oil rather than
sweet crude oil at many of our refineries decreased compared to 2006. Since more than 60% of our
total crude oil throughput represents sour crude oil and acidic sweet crude oil feedstocks that are
purchased at prices less than sweet crude oil, our profitability is significantly affected by the
spread between sweet crude oil and sour crude oil prices, referred to as the sour crude oil
differential. Sour crude oil differentials relative to WTI crude oil for 2007, although good,
decreased compared to the strong differentials in 2006. The fourth quarter of 2007 demonstrated the advantages of our complex and geographically diverse
refining system. While refined product margins were reduced due to a significant increase in
feedstock costs relative to product prices, our complex refineries were able to mitigate this
unfavorable effect by benefiting from wide sour crude oil differentials. In addition, while
product margins in the West Coast region were low, we were able to compensate somewhat for the
effect of the low West Coast margins with earnings in the other geographic regions in which we
operate. On February16, 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its propane
deasphalting unit, which reduced operating income by approximately $325million during the year
ended December31, 2007. The refinery recommenced operations in April at a reduced throughput
rate, with run rates increasing to near full capacity by the end of the third quarter of 2007. All
repairs have now been completed and the refinery is running at normal capacity as of February2008. Effective July1, 2007, we sold our refinery in Lima, Ohio to Husky Refining Company Husky, a
wholly owned subsidiary of Husky Energy Inc. The sales price was approximately $24billion,
including approximately $550million from the sale of working capital to Husky, primarily related
to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The sale resulted in a pre-tax
gain of $827million. During 2007, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $91million related to a
foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a foreign subsidiary.
In the second quarter of 2007, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program under which
we purchased 421million shares of our common stock, which was subsequently funded mainly with
proceeds from our issuance of $225billion of new debt during 2007. During 2007, we continued our ongoing effort to increase shareholder value by using a balanced
approach to allocating our cash flow. For the year ended December31, 2007, we generated $53
billion of net cash from operating activities, using portions of that cash to increase our 2007
common stock dividends from $008 per share to $012 per share and to purchase 422million shares
of our common stock in addition to the 421million shares purchased under the accelerated share
repurchase program discussed above. During 2007, we repurchased 14% of our shares that were
outstanding at the beginning of 2007. We also invested $28billion of capital into our refining
system and other assets. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2007 Compared to 2006 Financial Highlights

The following notes relate to references on pages 24 through 27.   a
Effective July1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of
operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining
operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima
Refinery.   b
Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 for operating revenues, cost of sales, retail
selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for comparability
with amounts reported in 2007.   c
On December22, 2006, we sold our remaining ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC
formerly Valero GP Holdings, LLC, which indirectly owned the general partner interest, the
incentive distribution rights, and a 214% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P.
formerly Valero L.P. As a result, the financial highlights reflect no equity in earnings of
NuStar Energy L.P. or minority interest in net income of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC subsequent to
December21, 2006.   d
Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by
throughput volumes.   e
Other products primarily include gas oils, No6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.   f
The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region
includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers,
Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining
region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region
includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining
region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.   g
The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene
and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene
differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the
lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent
Commodity Information Services - London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and
differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with
economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability.   h
The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab
Light posted prices.   i
The market reference differential for ultra-low-sulfur diesel was not available prior to May
1, 2006, and therefore no market reference differential is presented for the year ended
December31, 2006. 27 Table of Contents General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended
December31, 2006 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices. Operating income
decreased $804million, or 10%, and income from continuing operations decreased $722million, or
14%, for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006 primarily
due to an $827million decrease in refining segment operating income. The refining segment
operating income and income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery
which are classified as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in
Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment decreased from $82billion for the year ended December
31, 2006 to $74billion for the year ended December31, 2007 resulting mainly from increased
refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization expense of $631million. In
addition, total throughput margin for the refining segment declined by $196million due to a $014
per barrel decrease in refining throughput margin and lower throughput volumes. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, increased $040 per
barrel, or 11%, for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31, 2006.
Operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in maintenance expense, employee compensation
and related benefits, outside services, and energy costs, as well as increased accruals for sales
and use taxes. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 24% from 2006 to 2007
primarily due to the implementation of new capital projects, increased turnaround and catalyst
amortization, and the write-off of costs related to the McKee Refinery as a result of a fire
originating in its propane deasphalting unit in February2007. Total refining throughput margins for 2007 compared to 2006 were impacted by the following factors   
Overall, gasoline and distillate margins relative to WTI increased in 2007 compared to
2006 due to a decline in refined product inventory levels resulting from unplanned refinery
outages, lower imports, more stringent product specifications and regulations, and heavy
industry turnaround activity, as well as moderately stronger demand.   
Sour crude oil feedstock differentials to WTI crude oil during 2007 decreased from the
strong differentials in 2006. However, other light, sweet crude oils priced at a premium
to WTI in 2007; thus, sour crude oil feedstock differentials relative to those other light,
sweet crude oils in 2007 were comparable to the wide differentials experienced in 2006.
These wide differentials are attributable to continued ample supplies of sour crude oils
and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour crude oil
feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil resulting
from lower sulfur specifications for gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined
product demand.   
Margins on various secondary refined products such as asphalt, fuel oils, petroleum
coke, and sulfur were lower in 2007 as prices for these products did not increase in
proportion to the costs of the feedstocks used to produce them.   
Throughput volumes decreased 13,000 barrels per day during 2007 compared to 2006
primarily due to a reduction in throughput volumes at our McKee Refinery as a result of the
fire discussed above. Retail Retail operating income was $249million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to $182
million for the year ended December31, 2006. This 37% increase in operating income was primarily
attributable to
28 Table of Contents increased in-store sales and improved retail fuel margins in our U.S. and Canadian
retail operations, partially offset by higher selling expenses related mainly to retail reorganization expenses and an increase
in the Canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $44million for the year ended December31, 2007 compared to the year ended December31,
2006. This increase was primarily due to 2007 executive retirement expenses, an increase in
employee compensation and benefits, including incentive compensation, a $13million termination fee
paid in 2007 for the cancellation of our services agreement with NuStar Energy L.P., and increased
charitable contributions, partially offset by 2006 expenses attributable to Premcor headquarters
personnel that were not incurred during 2007. Other income, net for the year ended December31, 2007 included a $91million pre-tax gain
related to a foreign currency exchange rate gain resulting from the repayment of a loan by a
foreign subsidiary. Other income, net for the year ended December31, 2006 included a pre-tax
gain of $328million related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as
discussed in Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding these effects, other
income, net increased $54million from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increased interest income
related to our significantly higher cash balance during 2007. Interest and debt expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $225billion of notes in June
2007 to fund the accelerated share repurchase program as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, increased interest on tax liabilities, and reduced capitalized
interest due to a reduced balance of capital projects under construction. Income tax expense decreased $450million from 2006 to 2007 mainly as a result of lower income from
continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year ended
December31, 2007 decreased from the year ended December31, 2006 primarily due to an increase in
the percentage of pre-tax income contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are
non-taxable in Aruba through December31, 2010, combined with favorable tax law changes. Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense, increased $493million from the
year ended December31, 2006 to the year ended December31, 2007 due primarily to a pre-tax gain of
$827million, or $426million after tax, on the sale of the Lima Refinery in July2007 combined
with a $67million increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery between the two
years. The increase in net income from the operations of the Lima Refinery was mainly attributable
to a 94% increase in the refinerys throughput margin per barrel, from $899 per barrel for the
year ended December31, 2006 to $1741 per barrel for the six months ended June30, 2007, which
more than offset the effect of a decline in throughput volumes resulting from only six months of
operations in 2007 prior to its sale. 29 Table of Contents 2006 Compared to 2005 Financial Highlights

The following notes relate to references on pages 30 through 33.   
a
Effective July1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Therefore, the results of
operations of the Lima Refinery are reported as discontinued operations, and all refining
operating highlights, both consolidated and for the Mid-Continent region, exclude the Lima
Refinery.   b
Includes the operations related to the Premcor Acquisition commencing on September1, 2005.
Cost of sales and refining operating income presented for the year ended December31, 2005
include the effect of a $621million LIFO charge related to the difference between the fair
market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition under purchase
accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO accounting
policy. This charge was excluded from the consolidated and regional throughput margins per
barrel and the regional operating income amounts presented herein in order to make the
information presented comparable between periods.   c
Certain amounts previously reported in 2006 and 2005 for operating revenues, cost of sales,
retail selling expenses, and margin on miscellaneous sales have been reclassified for
comparability with amounts reported in 2007.   d
Operating revenues and cost of sales both include approximately $78billion for the year
ended December31, 2005 related to certain crude oil buy/sell arrangements, which involve
linked purchases and sales related to crude oil contracts entered into to address location,
quality, or grade requirements. Commencing January1, 2006, we
adopted EITF Issue No04-13
which requires that such buy/sell arrangements be accounted for as one transaction, thereby
resulting in no recognition of revenues and cost of sales for these transactions.   e
Throughput margin per barrel represents operating revenues less cost of sales divided by
throughput volumes.   f
Other products primarily include gas oils, No6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, and asphalt.   g
The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the Gulf Coast refining region
includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Texas City, Houston, Three Rivers,
Krotz Springs, St. Charles, Aruba, and Port Arthur Refineries; the Mid-Continent refining
region includes the McKee, Ardmore, and Memphis Refineries; the Northeast refining region
includes the Quebec City, Paulsboro, and Delaware City Refineries; and the West Coast refining
region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.   h
Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year
ended December31, 2006 include 287,000, 155,000, and 201,000 barrels per day, respectively,
related to the operations of the refineries acquired from Premcor on September1, 2005.
Throughput volumes for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Northeast regions for the year ended 33 Table of Contents   
December31, 2005 include 78,000, 53,000, and 63,000 barrels per day, respectively, related to
the operations of the refineries acquired from
Premcor commencing on September1, 2005. Throughput volumes for those acquired refineries for
the 122days of their operations subsequent to the acquisition date of September1, 2005 were
234,000, 157,000, and 187,000 barrels per day, respectively, for the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent,
and Northeast regions.   i
The information presented for the Mid-Continent region for the year ended December31, 2005
includes the operations of the Denver Refinery, which was sold on May31, 2005 to Suncor
Energy U.S.A. Inc. Throughput volumes for the Mid-Continent region for the year ended
December31, 2005 include 15,000 barrels per day related to the Denver Refinery.   j
The average market reference prices and differentials, with the exception of the propylene
and lube oil differentials, are based on posted prices from Platts Oilgram. The propylene
differential is based on posted propylene prices in Chemical Market Associates, Inc. and the
lube oil differential is based on Exxon Mobil Corporation postings provided by Independent
Commodity Information Services - London Oil Reports. The average market reference prices and
differentials are presented to provide users of the consolidated financial statements with
economic indicators that significantly affect our operations and profitability.   k
The market reference differential for sour crude oil is based on 50% Arab Medium and 50% Arab
Light posted prices. General Operating revenues increased 9% for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to the year ended
December31, 2005 primarily as a result of higher refined product prices combined with additional
throughput volumes from the former Premcor refinery operations. Operating income and income from
continuing operations for the year ended December31, 2006 increased significantly compared to the
year ended December31, 2005. Operating income increased $25billion, or 47%, from 2005 to 2006
due to a $25billion increase in the refining segment. The refining segment operating income and
income from continuing operations exclude the operations of the Lima Refinery which are classified
as discontinued operations due to our sale of that refinery as discussed in Note 2 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Refining Operating income for our refining segment increased from $57billion for the year ended December
31, 2005 to $82billion for the year ended December31, 2006 resulting from a 15% increase in
throughput volumes and an increase in refining throughput margin of $137 per barrel, or 12 partially offset by increased refining operating expenses including depreciation and amortization
expense of $11billion. In addition, the increase in the 2006 results was partially attributable
to the unfavorable impact in 2005 of a $621million pre-tax LIFO charge related to the difference
between the fair market value recorded for the inventories acquired in the Premcor Acquisition
under purchase accounting and the amounts required to be recorded in applying Valeros LIFO
accounting policy. The change in refining throughput margin for 2006 compared to 2005 was impacted by the following
factors   
Throughput volumes increased 376,000 barrels per day during 2006 compared to 2005 due to
449,000 barrels per day of incremental throughput from the three former Premcor refineries,
offset to some extent by the sale of the Denver Refinery in 2005 and significant planned
and unplanned downtime at several of our refineries in 2006.   
Overall, gasoline and distillate margins increased in 2006 compared to 2005 due to
significantly improved margins in the first half of 2006 attributable to increased foreign
and U.S. demand, limited capacity additions, major industry turnaround activity, and
continuing outages from the 2005 hurricanes. However, the 2006 increase in gasoline and
distillate margins was somewhat diminished in the second half of 2006 due to excess refined
product supply and the higher margins experienced in September and October of 2005 due to
the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.   
Differentials on sour crude oil feedstocks during 2006 were essentially unchanged from
the strong differentials in 2005, and remained wide due to continued ample supplies of sour
crude oils and heavy sour residual fuel oils on the world market. Differentials on sour
crude oil feedstocks also continued to benefit from increased demand for sweet crude oil
resulting from lower sulfur specifications for 34 Table of Contents   
gasoline and diesel and a global increase in refined product demand, particularly in Asia, which
resulted in higher utilization rates by refineries that require sweet crude oil as
feedstock.   
Throughput margin improved in 2006 due to the negative impact in 2005 of pre-tax losses
of approximately $525million on hedges related to forward sales of distillates and
associated forward purchases of crude oil.   
Margins on secondary refined products such as petroleum coke and sulfur were lower in
2006 due to an increase in the price of crude oil from 2005 to 2006. Refining operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, were 29% higher for
the year ended December31, 2006 compared to the year ended December31, 2005, primarily due to the
Premcor Acquisition on September1, 2005. Excluding the effect of the Premcor Acquisition,
operating expenses increased 5% due mainly to increases in maintenance expense, employee
compensation and related benefits, outside services, and catalyst and chemicals, partially offset
by reduced energy costs. Refining depreciation and amortization expense increased 38% from 2005 to
2006 primarily due to the Premcor Acquisition, the implementation of new capital projects, and
increased turnaround and catalyst amortization. Retail Retail operating income was $182million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to $154
million for the year ended December31, 2005. This 18% increase in operating income was primarily
attributable to improved retail fuel margins and increased in-store sales in the U.S. system. Corporate Expenses and Other General and administrative expenses, including corporate depreciation and amortization expense,
increased $47million for the year ended December31, 2006 compared to the year ended December31,
2005. The increase was primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefits,
stock-based compensation expense, environmental expenses, and charitable contributions as well as
the favorable resolution of a California excise tax dispute in 2005. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and 2005 nonrecurring expenses
attributable to Premcor headquarters personnel. Other income, net for the year ended December31, 2006 included a pre-tax gain of $328million
related to the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, as discussed in Note 9 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Interest and debt expense incurred increased from 2005 to 2006 due to the effect of a full year of
interest incurred in 2006 on the debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition, partially offset by a
reduction in other debt outstanding. Capitalized interest increased due to an increase in capital
projects, including projects at the three former Premcor refineries. Income tax expense increased $990million from 2005 to 2006 mainly as a result of a 55% increase in
income from continuing operations before income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the year
ended December31, 2006 increased from the year ended December31, 2005 as a lower percentage of
our pre-tax income was contributed by the Aruba Refinery, the profits of which are non-taxable in
Aruba through December31, 2010. This increase in the effective tax rate was partially offset by
the effects of new tax legislation in both Texas and Canada in 2006. 35 Table of Contents OUTLOOK Based on current forward market indicators, our outlook for refined product margins for the
remainder of 2008 is positive. With respect to the gasoline market, winter-grade gasoline
inventories increased in late 2007 and early 2008 in anticipation of the normal cycle of
industry-wide plant maintenance that occurs in the first quarter. As spring maintenance activities
occur, refined product supplies are expected to decline. In addition, the industry will soon be
making the transition from winter-grade gasoline to summer-grade gasoline, which is more difficult
and costly to produce due to more stringent specifications and thus generally contributes to a
decline in inventories. Furthermore, we expect strong diesel margins to continue and provide an
incentive to refiners to maximize diesel production, thereby further limiting gasoline supplies.
These anticipated supply constraints, combined with a typical seasonal increase in demand, are
expected to result in higher gasoline margins as the summer driving season approaches. Our outlook for on-road diesel margins is also favorable as on-road diesel demand continues to be
good and on-road diesel inventory levels in 2008 are below 2007 levels on a days-of-supply basis.
As a result, we expect on-road diesel margins to remain strong. In regard to feedstocks, sour crude oil differentials are expected to remain favorable during 2008.
Residual fuel oil prices have not increased as much as crude oil prices, which should support
wider differentials for sour crude oil since complex refiners can substitute residual fuel oil for
a portion of their sour crude oil requirements if residual fuel oil becomes more economic to
process than crude oil. In addition, new supplies of medium sour crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico
in 2008 should contribute to continuing wide sour crude oil differentials. On January25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery experienced a fire in its vacuum unit. We are in the
process of making the necessary repairs and we resumed partial operation of the refinery in
mid-February. We expect to resume full operations in the second quarter of 2008. Although we have
not completed our assessment of the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2008. Regarding other operations for 2008, we began scheduled maintenance on our coker drums at our Port
Arthur Refinery in the first quarter that will reduce throughput volumes in the Gulf Coast region
for about three months beginning in early February. Otherwise, our turnaround schedule for 2008 is
relatively light, which should benefit our results of operations during the year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flows for the Year Ended December31, 2007 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December31, 2007 was $53billion
compared to $63billion for the year ended December31, 2006. The decrease in cash generated from
operating activities was due primarily to the decrease in operating income discussed above under
Results of Operations and a $900million decrease in the eligible trade receivables sold under
our accounts receivable sales facility, as discussed in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Other changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended
December31, 2007 and 2006 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2007 due to a significant increase in gasoline,
distillate, and crude oil prices at December31, 2007 compared to such prices at the end of 2006. Cash flows related to the discontinued operations of the Lima Refinery have been combined with the
cash flows from continuing operations within each category in the consolidated statement of cash
flows for each period presented. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued
operations was $260million and 36 Table of Contents 215million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing
activities related to the Lima Refinery was $14million and $133million for the years ended
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December31, 2007, combined
with $22billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term notes, $24billion of proceeds from
the sale of our Lima Refinery, a $311million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized
stock-based compensation cost, and $159million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock
related to our employee benefit plans, were used mainly to   
fund $28billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs   
purchase 843million shares of our common stock at a cost of $58billion   
make an early long-term note redemption of $183million and scheduled long-term note
repayments of $280million   
fund capital contributions, net of distributions, of $209million to the Cameron Highway
Oil Pipeline Project mainly to enable the joint venture to redeem all of its outstanding
debt   
fund contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles
Refinery and the Delaware City Refinery of $50million and $25million, respectively   
pay common stock dividends of $271million; and   
increase available cash on hand by $874million. Cash Flows for the Year Ended December31, 2006 Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December31, 2006 was $63billion
compared to $59billion for the year ended December31, 2005. The increase in cash generated from
operating activities was primarily due to the significant increase in operating income discussed
above under Results of Operations, partially offset by a $12billion decrease from an
unfavorable change in working capital between the years and a $10billion increase in current
income tax expense. Changes in cash provided by or used for working capital during the years ended
December31, 2006 and 2005 are shown in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
primary difference in the working capital changes between the two years resulted from a favorable
working capital change in 2005 attributable to a $400million increase in the amount of receivables
sold under our accounts receivable sales program and a decrease in restricted cash of approximately
$200million due to the repayment of certain debt assumed in the Premcor Acquisition using funds
restricted for that purpose. Both receivables and accounts payable increased in 2006 due mainly to
higher prices for gasoline and crude oil at December31, 2006 compared to such prices at the end of
2005. Cash provided by operating activities related to our discontinued operations was $215million and
$121million for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used in investing
activities related to the Lima Refinery was $133million and $42million for the years ended
December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The net cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December31, 2006, combined
with $880million of proceeds from the sale of our ownership interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, a
$206million benefit from tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based compensation cost, and
$122million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to our employee benefit plans,
were used mainly to   
fund $38billion of capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs   
purchase 346million shares of our common stock at a cost of $20billion   
make long-term note repayments of $249million   
fund $101million of contingent earn-out payments in connection with the acquisition of
Basis Petroleum, Inc., the St. Charles Refinery, and the Delaware City Refinery   
terminate our interest rate swap contracts for $54million 37 Table of Contents   
pay common and preferred stock dividends of $184million; and   
increase available cash on hand by $12billion. Capital Investments During the year ended December31, 2007, we expended $23billion for capital expenditures and $518
million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs. Capital expenditures for the year ended
December31, 2007 included $614million of costs related to environmental projects. In addition,
we expended $75million for amounts due under contingent earn-out agreements. In connection with our acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery in 2003, the seller was entitled to
receive payments in any of the seven years following this acquisition if certain average refining
margins during any of those years exceeded a specified level see the discussion in Note 22 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, we
assumed Premcors obligation under a contingent earn-out agreement related to Premcors acquisition
of the Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC. Payments due under these earn-out
arrangements were limited based on annual and aggregate limits. During 2007, we made earn-out
payments of $50million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery and $25million
related to the acquisition of the Delaware City Refinery the maximum remaining payment based on
the aggregate limitation under that agreement. In January2008, we made a $25million earn-out
payment related to the St. Charles Refinery, which was the final payment based on the aggregate
limitation under that agreement. For 2008, we expect to incur approximately $45billion for capital investments, including
approximately $41billion for capital expenditures approximately $575million of which is for
environmental projects and approximately $400million for deferred turnaround and catalyst costs.
The capital expenditure estimate excludes anticipated expenditures related to strategic
acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. In May and June of 2007, we made cash capital contributions of $190million and $25million,
respectively, to the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project, representing our 50% portion of the
amount required for the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline joint venture to redeem its fixed-rate notes
and variable-rate debt, respectively. Our capital contributions, along with equal capital
contributions from the other 50% joint venture partner, were used to redeem all of the joint
ventures outstanding debt. Lima Refinery Disposition Effective July1, 2007, we sold our Lima Refinery to Husky. Proceeds from the sale were
approximately $24billion, including approximately $550million from the sale of working capital
to Husky, primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The
sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827million, or $426million after tax, which is presented in
income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of
income for the year ended December31, 2007. In connection with the sale, we entered into a
transition services agreement with Husky under which we agreed to provide certain accounting and
administrative services to Husky, with the services terminating by July31, 2008. A significant
portion of these services has been transitioned to Husky as of February27, 2008. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Our contractual obligations as of December31, 2007 are summarized below in millions.

Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations Payments for long-term debt and capital lease obligations in the table above reflect stated values
and minimum rental payments, respectively. During February2007, we redeemed our 925% senior notes that were scheduled to mature in 2010 for
$183million. In addition, during the year ended December31, 2007, we made scheduled debt
repayments of $280million related to various notes as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. In April2007, we borrowed $3billion under a 364-day term credit agreement with a financial
institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in Note 14 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. In May2007, we repaid $500million of the borrowings under the
364-day term credit agreement. The remaining balance of $25billion was repaid in June2007 using
available cash and proceeds from the issuance of $225billion of notes, as discussed in Note 12 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of December31, 2007, current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations as
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet consisted primarily of our 95% senior notes with a
stated value of $350million and a maturity date of February2013, which were redeemed in February
2008 as discussed in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post
additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt to
below investment grade ratings by Moodys Investors Service and Standard Poors Ratings Services,
the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would
increase. As of December31, 2007, all of our ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above
investment grade level as follows   
Rating Agency
Rating   Standard Poors Ratings Services
BBB stable outlook   Moodys Investors Service
Baa3 positive outlook   Fitch Ratings
BBB stable outlook Operating Lease Obligations Our operating lease obligations include leases for land, office facilities and equipment, retail
facilities and equipment, dock facilities, transportation equipment, and various facilities and
equipment used in the storage, transportation, production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and
refined products. Operating lease obligations include all operating leases that have initial or
remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year, and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be
received by us under subleases. The operating lease obligations reflected in the table above have
been reduced by related obligations that are included in other long-term liabilities. 39 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations A purchase obligation is an enforceable and legally binding agreement to purchase goods or services
that specifies significant terms, including ifixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, ii
fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and iiithe approximate timing of the transaction.
We have various purchase obligations including industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements
such as hydrogen supply arrangements, crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and
various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries.
Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on
market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. The purchase obligation amounts
included in the table above include both short-term and long-term obligations and are based on a
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and bfixed or estimated prices to be paid based on
current market conditions. As of December31, 2007, our short-term and long-term purchase
obligations increased by $70billion from the amount reported as of December31, 2006. The
increase is primarily attributable to higher crude oil and other feedstock prices at December31,
2007 compared to December31, 2006. Other Long-term Liabilities Our other long-term liabilities are described in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. For purposes of reflecting amounts for other long-term liabilities in the table above,
we have made our best estimate of expected payments for each type of liability based on information
available as of December31, 2007. Other Commercial Commitments As of December31, 2007, our committed lines of credit were as follows   
Borrowing
Capacity
Expiration   Revolving credit facility
$25billion
November2012   Canadian revolving credit facility
Cdn. $115million
December2012 As of December31, 2007, we had $502million of letters of credit outstanding under uncommitted
short-term bank credit facilities, $292million of letters of credit outstanding under our
committed revolving credit facility, and Cdn. $11million of letters of credit outstanding under
our Canadian committed revolving credit facility. These letters of credit expire during 2008 and
2009. Stock Purchase Programs During the first quarter of 2007, we had two stock purchase programs that had been previously
approved by our board of directors. One program authorized our purchase of our common stock in open
market transactions to satisfy employee benefit plan requirements and the other was a $2billion
common stock purchase program. Stock purchases under the programs are made from time to time at
prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, subject to market
conditions and other factors. The programs do not have a scheduled expiration date. On April25, 2007, our board of directors approved an amendment to our $2billion common stock
purchase program to increase the authorized purchases under the program to $6billion. In
conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program, we entered into an agreement
with a financial institution to purchase $3billion of our shares under an accelerated share
repurchase program, and in late April2007, 421million shares were purchased under this
agreement. The purchase of these shares was funded with a short-term bridge loan, which we
subsequently replaced with longer-term financing as described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. The cost of the shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase
program was to be adjusted, with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading
price of our 40 Table of Contents common
stock, weighted by the daily volume of shares traded, during the program period. Any adjustment to the
cost could be paid in cash or stock, at our option. The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on July23, 2007, and we elected to pay in
cash an additional $94million for the shares purchased. This cash payment had a dilutive effect
on our computation of earnings per common share from continuing operations assuming dilution for
the year ended December31, 2007 see Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2007, we purchased 705million shares of our common stock for $49billion under our $6
billion common stock purchase program, including shares purchased under the accelerated share
repurchase program discussed above, and 138million shares for $915million in connection with the
administration of our employee benefit plans. These purchases represented approximately 14% of our
outstanding shares of common stock as of December31, 2006. During 2008 through February22, we
have purchased 49million shares of our common stock for
$317million under our two stock purchase programs. On February28, 2008, our board of directors approved a
new $3billion stock purchase program. This program is in
addition to the $6billion program discussed above. This new $3billion program has no expiration date. Pension Plan Funded Status During 2007, we contributed $143million to our qualified pension plans. Based on a 600% discount
rate and fair values of plan assets as of December31, 2007, the fair value of the assets in our
qualified pension plans was equal to approximately 120% of the projected benefit obligation under
those plans as of the end of 2007. Although we have only $2million of minimum required contributions to our qualified pension plans
during 2008 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to use expected available
cash to contribute approximately $100million to our qualified plans during 2008. Environmental Matters As
discussed in Note23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including
those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution
prevention measures, greenhouse gas emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and
distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent
and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of
future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future. In addition,
any major upgrades in any of our refineries could require material additional expenditures to
comply with environmental laws and regulations. Tax Matters As
discussed in Note22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we are subject to extensive tax liabilities. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws
and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased
expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic
audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result
of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January1, 2007, the Government of Aruba GOAenacted a turnover tax on revenues from
the sale of goods produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for
on-island sales and services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our
Aruba Refinery. However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by
the GOA through December31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba
Refinery should not be subject to this turnover tax. No amounts have been accrued on exports with
respect to this turnover tax. We have commenced arbitration 41 Table of Contents proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute pursuant to which we will seek to enforce
our rights under the tax holiday. We have also filed protests of these assessments through
proceedings in Aruba. Other During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its
propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we have submitted
claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we
received an immaterial initial payment from the insurance carriers on our claims, the proceeds from
which were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. No
additional amount has been accrued related to these claims pending future settlements with the
insurance carriers. In November2007, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our Aruba
Refinery. In January2008, we announced our plan to explore strategic alternatives related to our
Memphis and Krotz Springs Refineries. Our refining and marketing operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry
and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers
may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these
customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we
believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent
necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant
problems collecting our accounts receivable. We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from the
public and private capital markets and bank markets, to fund our ongoing operating requirements.
We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through
equity or debt financings. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any
future financings or whether such financings can be made available on terms that are acceptable to
us. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As of December31, 2007, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party
financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1billion of eligible trade receivables,
which matures in August2008. We use this program as a source of working capital funding. Under
this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage ownership interest
in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party financial institutions. We
remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees related to our
sale of receivables under the program. During the third quarter of 2007, we reduced the amount of
eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions by $900million. Therefore, as
of December31, 2007, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial
institutions was $100million. Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includes
additional discussion of the activity related to this program. Termination of this program would require us to obtain alternate working capital funding, which
would result in an increase in accounts receivable and either increased debt or reduced cash on our
consolidated balance sheet. However, as of December31, 2007, the termination of this program
would not have had a material effect on our liquidity, particularly considering the reduction in
the utilization of the program during 2007 as discussed above, and would not have affected our
ability to comply with restrictive covenants in our credit facilities. We are not aware of any
existing circumstances that are reasonably likely to result in the termination or material
reduction in the availability of this program prior to its maturity. 42 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain new financial
accounting pronouncements have been issued which either have already been reflected in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, or will become effective for our financial
statements at various dates in the future. The adoption of these pronouncements has not had, and
is not expected to have, a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The following summary provides further information about our critical
accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates, and should be read in conjunction
with Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which summarizes our significant
accounting policies. The following accounting policies involve estimates that are considered
critical due to the level of sensitivity and judgment involved, as well as the impact on our
consolidated financial position and results of operations. We believe that all of our estimates
are reasonable. Impairment of Assets Long-lived assets excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method
investments, and deferred tax assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable
and exceeds its fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must
be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss should be recognized if the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds its fair value. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when
there is evidence that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the
investee is unable to sustain an earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in
the value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in
earnings, and is based on the difference between the estimated current fair value of the investment
and its carrying amount. In order to test for recoverability, management must make estimates of projected cash flows related
to the asset being evaluated which include, but are not limited to, assumptions about the use or
disposition of the asset, its estimated remaining life, and future expenditures necessary to
maintain its existing service potential. In order to determine fair value, management must make
certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, an assessment of market
conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, interest/equity rates, and growth rates, that
could significantly impact the fair value of the asset being tested for impairment. Due to the
significant subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair
value, changes in market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future,
thus affecting our earnings. Our impairment evaluations are based on assumptions that are
consistent with our business plans. However, providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions
were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number
of assumptions involved in the estimates. Environmental Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal, state, and local
authorities relating primarily to discharge of materials into the environment, waste management,
and pollution prevention measures. Future legislative action and regulatory initiatives could
result in changes to required operating permits 43 Table of Contents additional remedial actions, or increased capital expenditures and operating costs that cannot be
assessed with certainty at this time. Accruals for environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future
costs assuming currently available remediation technology and applying current regulations, as well
as our own internal environmental policies. However, environmental liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to uncertainties related to the magnitude of possible remediation, the
timing of such remediation, and the determination of our obligation in proportion to other parties.
Such estimates are subject to change due to many factors, including the identification of new
sites requiring remediation, changes in environmental laws and regulations and their
interpretation, additional information related to the extent and nature of remediation efforts, and
potential improvements in remediation technologies. An estimate of the sensitivity to earnings for
changes in those factors is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be
assessed, the number of underlying assumptions, and the wide range of possible outcomes. The balance of and changes in our accruals for environmental matters as of and for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is included in Note 23 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. We believe that we have adequately accrued for our environmental exposures. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs that are
developed from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including
discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future compensation increases, and health care cost
trend rates. Changes in these assumptions are primarily influenced by factors outside of our
control. For example, the discount rate assumption is based on a review of long-term bonds that
receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency as of the end of each
year, while the expected return on plan assets is based on a compounded return calculated for us by
an outside consultant using historical market index data with an asset allocation of 65% equities
and 35% bonds, which is representative of the asset mix in our qualified pension plans. These
assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial
statements. For example, a 025% decrease in the assumptions related to the discount rate or
expected return on plan assets or a 025% increase in the assumptions related to the health care
cost trend rate or rate of compensation increase would have the following effects on the projected
benefit obligation as of December31, 2007 and net periodic benefit cost for the year ending
December31, 2008 in millions

Tax Liabilities Our operations are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign
income taxes. We are also subject to various transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use,
payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad 44 Table of Contents valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed, and the implementation of future legislative and regulatory
tax initiatives could result in increased tax liabilities that cannot be predicted at this time.
In addition, we have received claims from various jurisdictions related to certain tax matters.
Tax liabilities include potential assessments of penalty and interest amounts. We record tax liabilities based on our assessment of existing tax laws and regulations. A
contingent loss related to a transactional tax claim is recorded if the loss is both probable and
estimable. The recording of our tax liabilities requires significant judgments and estimates.
Actual tax liabilities can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including different
interpretations of tax laws and regulations and different assessments of the amount of tax due. In
addition, in determining our income tax provision, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred
tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, will be
recovered through future taxable income. Significant judgment is required in estimating the amount
of valuation allowance, if any, that should be recorded against those deferred income tax assets.
If our actual results of operations differ from such estimates or our estimates of future taxable
income change, the valuation allowance may need to be revised. However, an estimate of the
sensitivity to earnings that would result from changes in the assumptions and estimates used in
determining our tax liabilities is not practicable due to the number of assumptions and tax laws
involved, the various potential interpretations of the tax laws, and the wide range of possible
outcomes. Legal Liabilities A variety of claims have been made against us in various lawsuits. Although we have been
successful in defending litigation in the past, we cannot be assured of similar success in future
litigation due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation and the individual fact circumstances in
each case. We record a liability related to a loss contingency attributable to such legal matters
if we determine the loss to be both probable and estimable. The recording of such liabilities
requires judgments and estimates, the results of which can vary significantly from actual
litigation results due to differing interpretations of relevant law and differing opinions
regarding the degree of potential liability and the assessment of reasonable damages. However, an
estimate of the sensitivity to earnings if other assumptions were used in recording our legal
liabilities is not practicable due to the number of contingencies that must be assessed and the
wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the
estimates of such loss. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK COMMODITY PRICE RISK We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices,
as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. In order to
reduce the risks of these price fluctuations, we use derivative commodity instruments to hedge a
portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories and a portion of our unrecognized
firm commitments to purchase these inventories fair value hedges. The carrying amount of our
refinery feedstock and refined product inventories was $39billion and $37billion as of December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and the fair value of such inventories was $101billion and $66
billion as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. From time to time, we use derivative
commodity instruments to hedge the price risk of forecasted transactions such as forecasted
feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases cash flow
hedges. We also use derivative commodity instruments that do not receive hedge accounting
treatment to manage our exposure to price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and
refined product inventories and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales, and natural gas purchases. These derivative instruments are considered economic
hedges for which changes in their fair value are recorded currently in cost of sales. Finally, we
enter into derivative commodity instruments based on our fundamental
and technical analysis of 45 Table of Contents market conditions that we mark to market for accounting purposes. See Derivative Instruments in
Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our accounting for the
various types of derivative transactions. The types of instruments used in our hedging and trading activities described above include swaps,
futures, and options. Our positions in derivative commodity instruments are monitored and managed
on a daily basis by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management
policy which has been approved by our board of directors. The following tables provide information about our derivative commodity instruments as of December
31, 2007 and 2006 dollars in millions, except for the weighted-average pay and receive prices as
described below, including   
fair value hedges, which are used to hedge our recognized refining inventories and
unrecognized firm commitments i.e., binding agreements to purchase inventories in the
future   
cash flow hedges, which are used to hedge our forecasted feedstock and product
purchases, refined product sales, and natural gas purchases   
economic hedges hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, which are used to   
manage price volatility in refinery feedstock and refined product inventories, and   
manage price volatility in forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined
product sales, and natural gas purchases; and   
derivative commodity instruments held or issued for trading purposes. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value hedge and the
offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item are recognized currently in income in the same period.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a
cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is then
recorded in income in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects
income. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if
any, is recognized in income as incurred. For our economic hedges and for derivative instruments
entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in income. The following tables include only open positions at the end of the indicated reporting period, and
therefore do not include amounts related to closed cash flow hedges for which the gain or loss
remains in accumulated other comprehensive income pending consummation of the forecasted
transactions. Contract volumes are presented in thousands of barrels for crude oil and refined products or in
billions of British thermal units for natural gas. The weighted-average pay and receive prices
represent amounts per barrel for crude oil and refined products or amounts per million British
thermal units for natural gas. Volumes shown for swaps represent notional volumes, which are
used to calculate amounts due under the agreements. For futures, the contract value represents the
contract price of either the long or short position multiplied by the derivative contract volume,
while the market value amount represents the period-end market price of the commodity being hedged
multiplied by the derivative contract volume. The pre-tax fair value for futures, swaps, and
options represents the fair value of the derivative contract. The pre-tax fair value for swaps
represents the excess of the receive price over the pay price multiplied by the notional contract
volumes. For futures and options, the pre-tax fair value represents ithe excess of the market
value amount over the contract amount for long positions, or iithe excess of the contract amount
over the market value amount for short positions. Additionally, for futures and options, the
weighted-average pay price represents the contract price for long positions and the
weighted-average receive price represents the contract price for short positions. The
weighted-average pay price and weighted-average receive price for options represents their strike
price. 46 Table of Contents

48 Table of Contents INTEREST RATE RISK In general, our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term
debt obligations. We manage our exposure to changing interest rates through the use of a
combination of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. In addition, we sometimes utilize interest rate
swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to changing interest rates by converting
certain fixed-rate debt to floating rate. These interest rate swap agreements are generally
accounted for as fair value hedges. The gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the gain or
loss on the debt that is being hedged are recorded in interest expense. The recorded amounts of
the derivative instrument and long-term debt balances are adjusted accordingly. We had no interest
rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December31, 2007 and 2006. The following table provides information about our long-term debt instruments dollars in
millions, the fair value of which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows
and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK We enter into foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts to manage our exposure to exchange
rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations. Changes in the fair value of
these contracts are recognized currently in income and are intended to offset the income effect of
translating the foreign currency denominated transactions that they are intended to hedge. As of December31, 2007, we had commitments to purchase $507million of U.S. dollars. Our market
risk was minimal on these contracts, as they matured on or before January29, 2008, resulting in a
2008 loss of $2million. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for
Valero. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of Valeros internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2007. In its evaluation, management used the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal Control -
Integrated Framework. Management believes that as of December31, 2007, our internal control over
financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which begins on page 52 of this
report. 50 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions
of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with
the Same Counterparty, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment, effective January1, 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Companys internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO, and our report dated February27, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP San Antonio, Texas
February27, 2008 51 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries We have audited Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 52 Table of Contents We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the consolidated balance
sheets of Valero Energy Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, cash flows and comprehensive
income for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, and our report dated
February27, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP San Antonio, Texas

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation As used in this report, the terms Valero, we, us, or our may refer to Valero Energy
Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. We are
an independent refining and marketing company and own and operate 17 refineries seven in Texas,
two each in California and Louisiana, and one each in Delaware, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Tennessee,
Aruba, and Quebec, Canada with a combined total throughput capacity as of December31, 2007 of
approximately 31million barrels per day. We market our refined products through an extensive
bulk and rack marketing network and approximately 5,800 retail and wholesale branded outlets in the
United States and eastern Canada under various brand names including Valero, Diamond
Shamrock, Shamrock, Ultramar, and
Beacon. Our operations are affected by   
company-specific factors, primarily refinery utilization rates and refinery maintenance
turnarounds   
seasonal factors, such as the demand for refined products during the summer driving
season and heating oil during the winter season; and   
industry factors, such as movements in and the level of crude oil prices including the
effect of quality differential between grades of crude oil, the demand for and prices of
refined products, industry supply capacity, and competitor refinery maintenance
turnarounds. These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Valero and subsidiaries in which
Valero has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Investments in significant noncontrolled entities are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting. As discussed in Note 2, the assets and liabilities of the Lima Refinery, as well as inventory sold
by our marketing and supply subsidiary associated with this transaction, have been reclassified as
held for sale as of December31, 2006, and the results of operations of the Lima Refinery have been
presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods
presented. On July19, 2006, we sold a 406% interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC formerly Valero GP Holdings,
LLC, which indirectly owned the general partner interest, incentive distribution rights, and a
214% limited partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. formerly Valero L.P. On December22, 2006,
we sold our remaining interest in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC. These financial statements consolidate
NuStar GP Holdings, LLC through December21, 2006, with net income attributable to the 406%
interest held by public unitholders from July19, 2006 through December21, 2006 presented as a
minority interest in the consolidated statement of income. See Note 9 under Sale of NuStar GP
Holdings, LLC for a discussion of the sale of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC. The term UDS Acquisition refers to the merger of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation UDSinto
Valero effective December31, 2001. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles GAAPrequires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, management reviews its estimates
based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised
estimates. 59 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Cash and Temporary Cash Investments Our temporary cash investments are highly liquid, low-risk debt instruments that have a maturity of
three months or less when acquired. Cash and temporary cash investments exclude cash that is not
available to us due to restrictions related to its use. Such amounts are segregated in the
consolidated balance sheets in restricted cash see Note 3. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market. The cost of refinery feedstocks purchased
for processing and refined products are determined under the last-in, first-out LIFOmethod using
the dollar-value LIFO method, with any increments valued based on average purchase prices during
the year. The cost of feedstocks and products purchased for resale and the cost of materials,
supplies, and convenience store merchandise are determined principally under the weighted-average
cost method. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Statement No151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material and requires that those items be
recognized as current-period charges. Statement No151 also requires that allocation of fixed
production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The adoption of Statement No151 did not affect our financial position or results of
operations. Property, Plant and Equipment Additions to property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and certain costs
allocable to construction and property purchases, are recorded at cost. The costs of minor property units or components of property units, net of salvage value, retired
or abandoned are charged or credited to accumulated depreciation under the composite method of
depreciation. Gains or losses on sales or other dispositions of major units of property are
recorded in income and are reported in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated
statements of income. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related facilities primarily using the composite method of
depreciation. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized using
the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the
related asset. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the assets
acquired less liabilities assumed. Intangible assets are assets that lack physical substance
excluding financial assets. Goodwill acquired in a business combination and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and intangible assets with finite useful lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over 1 to 40years. Goodwill and intangible assets not subject
to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We use October 1 of each year as our valuation
date for annual impairment testing purposes. 60 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Deferred Charges and Other Assets Deferred charges and other assets, net include the following   
refinery turnaround costs, which are incurred in connection with planned major
maintenance activities at our refineries and which are deferred when incurred and amortized
on a straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next
turnaround occurs   
fixed-bed catalyst costs, representing the cost of catalyst that is changed out at
periodic intervals when the quality of the catalyst has deteriorated beyond its prescribed
function, which are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the specific catalyst   
investments in entities that we do not control; and   
other noncurrent assets such as long-term investments, convenience store dealer
incentive programs, pension plan assets, debt issuance costs, and various other costs. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment when there is evidence that we may not be
able to recover the carrying amount of our investments or the investee is unable to sustain an
earnings capacity that justifies the carrying amount. A loss in the value of an investment that is
other than a temporary decline is recognized currently in earnings, and is based on the difference
between the estimated current fair value of the investment and its carrying amount. We believe
that the carrying amounts of our equity method investments as of December31, 2007 are recoverable. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No04-5,
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited
Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights EITF No04-5, which
requires the general partner in a limited partnership to determine whether the limited partnership
is controlled by, and therefore should be consolidated by, the general partner. The adoption of
EITF No04-5 had no impact on the accounting for our investment in NuStar Energy L.P. Impairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets excluding goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite lives, equity method
investments, and deferred tax assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is not
recoverable if its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition. If a long-lived asset is not recoverable, an
impairment loss is recognized in an amount by which its carrying amount exceeds its fair value,
with fair value determined based on discounted estimated net cash flows. We believe that the
carrying amounts of our long-lived assets as of December31, 2007 are recoverable. Taxes Other than Income Taxes Taxes other than income taxes includes primarily liabilities for ad valorem, excise, sales and
use, and payroll taxes. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred amounts are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the year those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. 61 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued In June2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -
an interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with
FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by prescribing a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. If a tax position is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination, then an enterprise would be required to recognize in its financial
statements the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement. As discussed in Note 18, the adoption of FIN 48 effective January1,
2007 did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations. We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to the underpayment of
income taxes in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income. Asset Retirement Obligations We record a liability, which is referred to as an asset retirement obligation, at fair value for
the estimated cost to retire a tangible long-lived asset at the time we incur that liability, which
is generally when the asset is purchased, constructed, or leased. We record the liability when we
have a legal obligation to incur costs to retire the asset and when a reasonable estimate of the
fair value of the liability can be made. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the
liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate
the liabilitys fair value. We have asset retirement obligations with respect to certain of our refinery assets due to various
legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of various component parts of each refinery at the time
they are retired. However, these component parts can be used for extended and indeterminate
periods of time as long as they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and
current intent to maintain our refinery assets and continue making improvements to those assets
based on technological advances. As a result, we believe that our refineries have indeterminate
lives for purposes of estimating asset retirement obligations because dates or ranges of dates upon
which we would retire refinery assets cannot reasonably be estimated at this time. When a date or
range of dates can reasonably be estimated for the retirement of any component part of a refinery,
we estimate the cost of performing the retirement activities and record a liability for the fair
value of that cost using established present value techniques. We also have asset retirement obligations for the removal of underground storage tanks USTs for
refined products at owned and leased retail locations. There is no legal obligation to remove USTs
while they remain in service. However, environmental laws require that unused USTs be removed
within certain periods of time after the USTs no longer remain in service, usually one to two years
depending on the jurisdiction in which the USTs are located. We have estimated that USTs at our
owned retail locations will not remain in service after 25years of use and that we will have an
obligation to remove those USTs at that time. For our leased retail locations, our lease
agreements generally require that we remove certain improvements, primarily USTs and signage, upon
termination of the lease. While our lease agreements typically contain options for multiple
renewal periods, we have not assumed that such leases will be renewed for purposes of estimating
our obligation to remove USTs and signage. Effective December31, 2005, we adopted FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset
retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, represents a legal 62 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued obligation to perform an asset retirement activity for which the
timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within
the control of the entity. Since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is
unconditional, FIN 47 provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be recognized if its fair value can be reasonably estimated, even
though uncertainty exists about the timing and/or method of its settlement. FIN 47 also clarifies
when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a
conditional asset retirement obligation under FASB Statement No143. The adoption of FIN 47 did
not affect our financial position or results of operations. Foreign Currency Translation The functional currencies of our Canadian and Aruban operations are the Canadian dollar and the
Aruban florin, respectively. The translation of the Canadian operations into U.S. dollars is
computed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and
for revenue and expense accounts using the weighted-average exchange rates during the year.
Adjustments resulting from this translation are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income. The value of the Aruban florin is fixed to the U.S. dollar at 179 Aruban florins to one
U.S. dollar. The translation of the Aruban operations into U.S. dollars is computed based on this
fixed exchange rate for both balance sheet and income statement accounts. As a result, there are
no adjustments resulting from this translation reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Revenue Recognition Revenues for products sold by both the refining and retail segments are recorded upon delivery of
the products to our customers, which is the point at which title to the products is transferred,
and when payment has either been received or collection is reasonably assured. Revenues for
services are recorded when the services have been provided. In June2006, the FASB ratified its consensus on EITF Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected from
Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement
That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation EITF No06-3. The scope of EITF No06-3 includes any
tax assessed by a governmental authority that is imposed concurrent with or subsequent to a
revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer. For taxes within the scope of this
issue that are significant in amount, the consensus requires the following disclosures: ithe
accounting policy elected for these taxes and iithe amount of the taxes reflected gross in the
income statement on an interim and annual basis for all periods presented. The disclosure of those
taxes can be provided on an aggregate basis. We adopted the consensus effective January1, 2007.
We present excise taxes on sales by our U.S. retail system on a gross basis with supplemental
information regarding the amount of such taxes included in revenues provided in a footnote on the
face of the income statement. All other excise taxes are presented on a net basis in the income
statement. Through December31, 2005, our operating revenues included sales related to certain buy/sell
arrangements. In September2005, the FASB ratified its consensus on EITF Issue No04-13,
Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty EITF No04-13,
which requires that inventory purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are
entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined. The guidance in EITF No04-13
was effective for transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after March15, 2006, with
early application permitted. We adopted EITF No04-13 on January1, 2006. 63 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued One issue addressed by EITF No04-13 details factors to consider in evaluating whether certain
individual transactions to purchase and sell inventory are made in contemplation of one another and
should therefore be viewed as one transaction when applying the principles of AICPA Accounting
Principles Board APBOpinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. When applying
these factors, certain of our buy/sell arrangements are deemed to be made in contemplation of one
another. Accordingly, commencing January1, 2006, revenues and cost of sales ceased to be
recognized in connection with these arrangements. This adoption resulted in a reduction in our
operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income and a corresponding reduction in cost of
sales with no material impact on operating income, net income or net income applicable to common
stock. If we had applied EITF No04-13 for the year ended December31, 2005, operating revenues
and cost of sales would have been reduced by the amounts reflected in the supplemental information
on the face of the consolidated statement of income. We also enter into refined product exchange transactions to fulfill sales contracts with our
customers by accessing refined products in markets where we do not operate our own refinery. These
refined product exchanges are accounted for as exchanges of non-monetary assets, and no revenues
are recorded on these transactions. Product Shipping and Handling Costs Costs incurred for shipping and handling of products are included in cost of sales in the
consolidated statements of income. Environmental Matters Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs over a 20-year time
period using currently available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own
internal environmental policies. Amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been
reduced by possible recoveries from third parties. Derivative Instruments All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
measured at their fair value. When we enter into a derivative instrument, it is designated as a
fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, an economic hedge, or a trading instrument. For our economic
hedging relationships hedges not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges and for derivative
instruments entered into by us for trading purposes, the derivative instrument is recorded at fair
value and changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognized currently in
income. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value
hedge, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk,
are recognized currently in income in the same period. The effective portion of the gain or loss
on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is initially reported as
a component of other comprehensive income and is then recorded in income in the period or periods
during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects income. The ineffective portion of the gain
or loss on the cash flow derivative instrument, if any, is recognized in income as incurred.
Income effects of commodity derivative instruments are recorded in cost of sales while income
effects of interest rate swaps if applicable are recorded in interest and debt expense. 64 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Financial Instruments Our financial instruments include cash and temporary cash investments, restricted cash,
receivables, payables, debt, capital lease obligations, commodity derivative contracts, and foreign
currency derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments
approximate their carrying amounts as reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, except for
certain long-term debt as discussed in Note 12. The fair values of our debt, commodity derivative
contracts, and foreign currency derivative contracts were estimated primarily based on year-end
quoted market prices. In February2006, the FASB issued Statement No155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments, which amends Statement No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and Statement No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities. This statement improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid
financial instruments and simplifies the accounting for these instruments. In particular,
Statement No155 ipermits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that
contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, iiclarifies which
interest-only and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of Statement No133,
iiiestablishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify
interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain
an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, ivclarifies that concentrations of credit risk in
the form of subordination are not embedded
derivatives, and vamends Statement No140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying
special-purpose entity holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial
interest other than another derivative financial instrument. The adoption of Statement No155
effective January1, 2007 did not affect our financial position or results of operations. In March2006, the FASB issued Statement No156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets,
which amends Statement No140. Statement No156 requires the initial recognition at fair value
of a servicing asset or servicing liability when an obligation to service a financial asset is
undertaken by entering into a servicing contract. The adoption of Statement No156 effective
January1, 2007 did not affect our financial position or results of operations. Earnings per Common Share Earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Earnings per common share
assuming dilution reflects the potential dilution of our outstanding stock options and nonvested
shares granted to employees in connection with our stock compensation plans, as well as the 2%
mandatory convertible preferred stock prior to its conversion as discussed in Note 14. In
addition, see Notes 14 and 15 for a discussion of an accelerated share repurchase program during
2007 and its effect on earnings per common share assuming dilution for the year ended December31,
2007. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting stockholders
equity that, under GAAP, are excluded from net income, including foreign currency translation
adjustments, gains and losses related to certain derivative contracts, and gains or losses, prior
service costs or credits, and transition assets or obligations associated with pension or other
postretirement benefits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost. 65 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans In September2006, the FASB issued Statement No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which amends Statement No87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, Statement No88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, Statement No106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, Statement No132 revised 2003, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, and other related accounting
literature. Statement No158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a
defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or a liability in the statement of financial
position and to recognize changes in that funded status through comprehensive income in the year
the changes occur. This statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan
as of the date of the employers year-end statement of financial position. We adopted the funded
status recognition and related disclosure requirements of Statement No158 as of December31,
2006, and measured the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of that date. The adoption of
Statement No158 did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Stock-Based Compensation Through December31, 2005, we accounted for our employee stock compensation plans using the
intrinsic value method of accounting set forth in APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations as permitted by FASB Statement No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. 66 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Because we accounted for our employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method,
compensation cost was not recognized in the consolidated statements of income for our fixed stock
option plans as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for our fixed stock option
plans been determined based on the grant-date fair value of awards consistent with the alternative
method set forth in Statement No123, our net income applicable to common stock, net income, and
earnings per common share, both with and without dilution, for the year ended December31, 2005
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the following table in millions,

Stock-based compensation expense recognized for the year ended December31, 2005 was $52million,
net of tax benefits of $28million. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
Statement No123R, which requires the expensing of the fair value of stock options. The
specific impact of our adoption of Statement No123R will depend on levels of share-based
incentive awards granted in the future. Had we adopted Statement No123R in prior periods, the
impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No123 as described in the
disclosure of the pro forma financial information above. We adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement No123R using the modified
prospective application. Accordingly, we are recognizing compensation expense for all newly
granted stock options and stock options modified, repurchased, or cancelled on or after January1,
2006. In addition, compensation cost for the unvested portion of stock options and other awards
that were outstanding as of January1, 2006 is being recognized over the remaining vesting period
based on the fair value at date of grant and the attribution approach utilized in determining the
pro forma information reflected above. Subsequent to the adoption of Statement No123R, our total
stock-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December31 67 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 2007 and 2006 was $65
million, net of tax benefits of $35million, and $70million, net of tax benefits of $38million,
respectively. Under our employee stock compensation plans, certain awards of stock options and restricted stock
provide that employees vest in the award when they retire or will continue to vest in the award
after retirement over the nominal vesting period established in the award. We previously accounted
for such awards by recognizing compensation cost, if any, under APB Opinion No25 and pro forma
compensation cost under Statement No123 over the nominal vesting period. Upon the adoption of
Statement No123R, compensation expense for stock options granted on or after January1, 2006 is
being recognized on a straight-line basis, and we changed our method of recognizing compensation
cost for new grants that have retirement-eligibility provisions from the nominal vesting period
approach to the non-substantive vesting period approach. Under the non-substantive vesting period
approach, compensation cost is recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible
employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if
that date is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. If the non-substantive vesting
period approach had been used by us for awards granted prior to January1, 2006, pro forma net
income applicable to common stock and pro forma net income amounts for the year ended December31,
2005 would have decreased by $8million, and net income applicable to common stock and net income
for each of the years ended December31, 2006 and 2007 would have increased by $4million. Statement No123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock-based
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as
previously required. This requirement reduces cash flows from operating activities and increases
cash flows from financing activities beginning in 2006. While we cannot estimate the specific
magnitude of this change on future cash flows because it depends on, among other things, when
employees exercise stock options, the cash flows recognized in financing activities for such excess
tax deductions were $311million and $206million for the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Sales of Subsidiary Stock Securities and Exchange Commission SECStaff Accounting Bulletin No51, Accounting for Sales of
Stock by a Subsidiary SAB 51, provides guidance on accounting for the effect of issuances of a
subsidiarys stock on the parents investment in that subsidiary. SAB 51 allows registrants to
elect an accounting policy of recording such increases or decreases in a parents investment SAB
51 credits or charges, respectively either in income or in stockholders equity. In accordance
with the election provided in SAB 51, we adopted a policy of recording such SAB 51 credits or
charges directly to additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity. As further discussed in
Note 9, we recognized in 2006 certain SAB 51 credits related to our investment in NuStar Energy
L.P. under our adopted policy. Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets In December2004, the FASB issued Statement No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which
addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets. Statement No153 eliminates the
exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets, which
was previously provided by APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and
replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. Statement No.
153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement No153 was
effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges 68 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

FASB Statement No157 In September2006, the FASB issued Statement No157, Fair Value Measurements. Statement No157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and expands
disclosures about fair value measures. Statement No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007, with early adoption encouraged. The provisions of Statement No157 are to be applied on a
prospective basis, with the exception of certain financial instruments for which retrospective
application is required.
FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2 FSP 157-2, issued in February 2008, delayed the effective date of Statement No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. We have adopted Statement No. 157 effective January 1, 2008, with the exceptions allowed under FSP 157-2, the adoption of which has not affected our financial position or results of operations. FASB Statement No159 In February2007, the FASB issued Statement No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities. Statement No159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
fair value. Statement No159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007,
with early adoption permitted provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of Statement
No157. The adoption of Statement No159 effective January1, 2008 has not affected our
financial position or results of operations. FASB Statement No141 revised 2007 In December2007, the FASB issued Statement No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations
Statement No141R. This statement improves the financial reporting of business combinations and
clarifies the accounting for these transactions. Statement No141R irequires the recognition
and measurement of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree at their fair values at the acquisition date, iirequires acquisition costs and any
related restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition, iiirequires step
acquisitions to be recognized at the full amounts of the fair values of the identifiable assets and
liabilities, as well as any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, ivchanges the requirements
for recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, vdefines a
bargain purchase as a business combination in which the total acquisition-date fair value of the
identifiable net assets exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any
noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, virequires the recognition of any bargain purchase as a
gain in the earnings of the acquirer, and viirequires the recognition of changes in deferred tax
benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination. The provisions of Statement No.
141R are to be applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after
the beginning of an entitys fiscal year that begins on or after December15, 2008, with early
adoption prohibited. Due to its application to future acquisitions, the adoption of Statement No.
141R effective January1, 2009 will not have any immediate effect on our financial position or
results of operations. 69 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued FASB Statement No160 Also in December2007, the FASB issued Statement No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No51. Statement No160 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December15, 2008.
This statement provides guidance for the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests,
changes in controlling interests, and the deconsolidation of subsidiaries. In addition, Statement
No160 amends FASB Statement No128, Earnings per Share, to specify the computation,
presentation, and disclosure requirements for earnings per share if an entity has one or more
noncontrolling interests. The adoption of Statement No160 effective January1, 2009 is not
expected to materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Reclassifications Certain amounts previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December

Company Husky, a wholly owned subsidiary of Husky Energy Inc. In addition, our marketing and
supply subsidiary separately agreed to sell certain inventory amounts to Husky as part of this
transaction. As a result, the assets and liabilities related to these transactions are presented

approximately $24billion, including approximately $550million from the sale of working capital
to Husky primarily related to the sale of inventory by our marketing and supply subsidiary. The
sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $827million, or $426million after tax, which is included in
income from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense in the consolidated statement of

Premcor Acquisition On September1, 2005, we completed our merger with Premcor Inc. Premcor. As used in this report,
Premcor Acquisition refers to the merger of Premcor with and into Valero. Premcor was an
independent petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oil,
petrochemical feedstocks, petroleum coke, and other petroleum products with all of its operations
in the United States. Premcor owned and operated refineries in Port Arthur, Texas; Lima, Ohio;
Memphis, Tennessee; and Delaware City, Delaware with a combined crude oil throughput capacity of
approximately 800,000 barrels per day. During 2006, an independent appraisal of the assets acquired in the Premcor Acquisition and certain
other evaluations related to the Premcor Acquisition purchase price allocation were completed. The
purchase price of the Premcor Acquisition was allocated based on the fair values of the assets
acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition resulting from this final appraisal
and other evaluations. The purchase price and the final purchase price allocation were as follows

We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party financial institutions to
sell on a revolving basis up to $1billion of eligible trade receivables, which matures in August
2008. Under this program, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sells an undivided percentage
ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to third-party financial
institutions. We remain responsible for servicing the transferred receivables and pay certain fees
related to our sale of receivables under the program. Under the facility, we retain the residual
interest in the designated pool of receivables. This retained interest, which is included in
receivables, net in the consolidated balance sheets, is recorded at fair value. Due to ia
short average collection cycle for such receivables, iiour collection experience history, and
iiithe composition of the designated pool of trade accounts receivable that are part of this
program, the fair value of our retained interest approximates the total amount of the designated
pool of accounts receivable reduced by the amount of accounts receivable sold to the third-party
financial institutions under the program. The costs we incurred related to this facility, which were included in other income, net in the
consolidated statements of income, were $40million, $55million, and $30million for the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Proceeds from collections under this
facility of $193billion, $312billion, and $241billion for the years ended December31, 2007,
2006, and 2005, respectively, were reinvested in the program by the third-party financial
institutions. However, the third-party financial institutions interests in our accounts
receivable were never in excess of the sales facility limits at any time under this program. No
accounts receivable included in this program were written off during 2007, 2006, or 2005. 73 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued As of December31, 2007 and 2006, $40billion and $26billion, respectively, of our accounts
receivable composed the designated pool of accounts receivable included in the program. During
2007, we reduced the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions
by $900million. As a result, as of December31, 2007 and 2006, the amount of eligible receivables
sold to the third-party financial institutions was $100million and $1billion, respectively. 5. INVENTORIES Inventories consisted of the following in millions

those acquisitions, the effects of which were recorded as purchase price adjustments, and
adjustments to the amount of goodwill attributable to our investment in NuStar Energy L.P. see
Note 9. All of our goodwill has been allocated among four reporting units that comprise the refining
segment. These reporting units are the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Northeast, and West Coast
refining regions. We completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill as of October1, 2007
and 2006, confirming that no impairment of goodwill had occurred in any of our reporting units as
of those dates. 9. INVESTMENT IN AND TRANSACTIONS WITH NUSTAR ENERGY L.P. NuStar Energy L.P. is a limited partnership that owns and operates crude oil and refined product
pipeline, terminalling, and storage tank assets. As discussed in Note 1 under Basis of
Presentation and Principles of Consolidation, one of our previously wholly owned subsidiaries,
NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, served as the general partner of and held our limited partner interest in
NuStar Energy L.P. On July1, 2005, NuStar Energy L.P. completed its acquisition of Kaneb Pipe
Line Partners, L.P. Kaneb Partners and Kaneb Services LLC together, the Kaneb Acquisition in a
transaction that included the issuance of NuStar Energy L.P. common units in exchange for Kaneb
Partners units. In addition, we contributed $29million to NuStar Energy L.P. to maintain our 2%
general partner interest in NuStar Energy L.P. As a result of these transactions, our combined
ownership interest in NuStar Energy L.P. was reduced from 457% to 234%. Our ownership interest
in NuStar Energy L.P. remained at 234% as of June30, 2006 the end of the quarter prior to the
offerings discussed below under the heading Sale of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, which was composed
of a 2% general partner interest, incentive distribution rights, and a 214% limited partner
interest. The limited partner interest was represented by 10,222,630 common units of NuStar
Energy L.P., of which 9,599,322 were previously subordinated units that converted to common units
on May8, 2006 upon the termination of the subordination period in accordance with the terms of
NuStar Energy L.P.s partnership agreement. 76 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Through the date of termination of the subordination period, NuStar Energy L.P. had issued common
units to the public on three separate occasions, which had diluted our ownership percentage. These
three issuances resulted in increases, or SAB 51 credits see Note 1 under Sales of Subsidiary
Stock, in our proportionate share of NuStar Energy L.P.s capital because, in each case, the issuance price per unit exceeded our
carrying amount per unit at the time of issuance. We had not recognized any SAB 51 credits in our
consolidated financial statements through March31, 2006 and were not permitted to do so until the
subordinated units converted to common units. In conjunction with the conversion of the
subordinated units held by us to common units in the second quarter of 2006, we recognized the
entire balance of $158million in SAB 51 credits as an increase in our investment in NuStar Energy
L.P. and $101million after tax as an increase to additional paid-in capital in our consolidated
balance sheet. Sale of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC On July19, 2006, NuStar GP Holdings, LLC consummated an initial public offering IPOof
17,250,000 of its units representing limited liability company interests to the public at $2200
per unit, before an underwriters discount of $1265 per unit. On December22, 2006, NuStar GP
Holdings, LLC completed a secondary public offering of 20,550,000 units representing limited
liability company interests at a price of $2162 per unit, before an underwriters discount of
$08648 per unit. In addition, NuStar GP Holdings, LLC sold 4,700,000 unregistered units to its
chairman of the board of directors who was at that time also chairman of Valeros board of
directors at $2162 per unit. All such units were sold by our subsidiaries that held various
ownership interests in NuStar GP Holdings, LLC. As a result, NuStar GP Holdings, LLC did not
receive any proceeds from these offerings, and our indirect ownership interest in NuStar GP
Holdings, LLC was reduced to zero. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the IPO totaled approximately $355million, net of the
underwriters discount and other offering expenses, which resulted in a pre-tax gain to us of $132
million on the sale of the units. Proceeds to our selling subsidiaries from the secondary offering
and private sale of units totaled approximately $525million, net of the underwriters discount and
other offering expenses, which resulted in an additional pre-tax gain to us of $196million. The
total pre-tax gain of $328million is included in other income, net in the consolidated statement
of income for the year ended December31, 2006. The funds received from these offerings were used
for general corporate purposes. Summary Financial Information Financial information reported by NuStar Energy L.P. is summarized below in millions

Related-Party Transactions Under various throughput, handling, terminalling, and service agreements, we use NuStar Energy
L.P.s pipelines to transport crude oil shipped to and refined products shipped from certain of our
refineries and use NuStar Energy L.P.s refined product terminals for certain terminalling
services. In addition, through 2006, we provided personnel to NuStar Energy L.P. to perform
operating and maintenance services with respect to certain assets for which we received
reimbursement from NuStar Energy L.P. We recognized in cost of sales both our costs related to the throughput, handling, terminalling, and service agreements with NuStar 77 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Energy L.P. and the
receipt from NuStar Energy L.P. of payment for operating and maintenance services we provided to
NuStar Energy L.P. We have indemnified NuStar Energy L.P. for certain environmental liabilities
related to assets we previously sold to NuStar Energy L.P. that were known on the date the assets
were sold or are discovered within a specified number of years after the assets were sold as a result of events occurring or conditions existing
prior to the date of sale. Under a services agreement, through December31, 2005, we provided NuStar Energy L.P. with the
corporate functions of legal, accounting, treasury, engineering, information technology, and other
services for an administrative fee. Effective January1, 2006, the administrative fee was amended
to provide for fewer services as a result of the transfer to NuStar GP, LLC formerly Valero GP,
LLC, the general partner of the general partner of NuStar Energy L.P., of a substantial number of
employees of our subsidiaries who had previously provided services to NuStar GP, LLC under the
prior services agreement. The administrative fee was recorded as a reduction of general and
administrative expenses. Effective January1, 2007, the services agreement was amended to provide
for limited services. This amended services agreement provided for a termination date of December
31, 2010, unless we terminated the agreement earlier, in which case we were required to pay a
termination fee of $13million. In April2007, we notified NuStar Energy L.P. of our decision to
terminate the services agreement. Accordingly, the $13million termination fee was accrued and
paid during the second quarter of 2007. As of December31, 2006, our receivables, net included $1million from NuStar Energy L.P.,
representing amounts due for employee costs, insurance costs, operating expenses, administrative
costs, and rentals. As of December31, 2006, our accounts payable included $21million to NuStar
Energy L.P., representing amounts due for pipeline tariffs, terminalling fees, and tank rentals and
fees. The following table summarizes the results of transactions with NuStar Energy L.P. in

indicated in Note 1, refinery turnaround costs are deferred when incurred and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the period of time estimated to lapse until the next turnaround occurs.
Fixed-bed catalyst costs are deferred when incurred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful life of the specific catalyst. Amortization expense for deferred refinery
turnaround and catalyst costs was $383million, $293million, and $205million for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. 78 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project We own a 50% interest in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Company, a general partnership formed to
construct and operate a crude oil pipeline the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project. The
390-mile crude oil pipeline, which began operations during the first quarter of 2005, delivers up
to 500,000 barrels per day from the Gulf of Mexico to the major refining areas of Port Arthur and
Texas City, Texas. Our investment in the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Project is accounted for
using the equity method and is included in deferred charges and other assets, net in the
consolidated balance sheets. During May and June of 2007, we made cash capital contributions of
$215million representing our 50% portion of the amount required to enable the joint venture to
redeem its fixed-rate notes and variable-rate debt. In 2005, we received a $48million return of
our investment resulting from the refinancing of the Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline Projects debt.

notes as of December31, 2007 was $381million. 80 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Bank Credit Facilities In August2005, we replaced our two $750million revolving bank credit facilities with a $25
billion five-year revolving credit facility the Revolver, which originally had a maturity date of
August2010. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, or an alternate
base rate as defined under the agreement. We are also being charged various fees and expenses in
connection with the Revolver, including facility fees and letter of credit fees. The interest rate
and fees under the Revolver are subject to adjustment based upon the credit ratings assigned to our
long-term debt. The Revolver also included certain restrictive covenants including a coverage
ratio and a debt-to-capitalization ratio. In July2006, the Revolver was amended to iextend the
maturity date by one year to August2011, iieliminate the coverage ratio covenant, and iii
reduce the pricing under the agreement. In November2007, the Revolver was amended to extend the
maturity date from August2011 to November2012. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, there were no
borrowings outstanding under the Revolver and outstanding letters of credit issued under this
facility totaled $292million and $245million, respectively. In addition to the Revolver, one of our Canadian subsidiaries has a committed revolving credit
facility under which it may borrow and obtain letters of credit up to Cdn. $115million. In
December2007, the Canadian credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date from December
2010 to December2012. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding and
letters of credit issued under this credit facility totaled Cdn. $11million and Cdn. $85million,
respectively. We also have various uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities. As of December31, 2007 and
2006, we had no borrowings outstanding under our uncommitted short-term bank credit facilities;
however, there were $502million and $343million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding
under such facilities. The uncommitted credit facilities have no commitment or other fees or
compensating balance requirements and are unsecured and unrestricted as to use. During April2007, we borrowed $3billion under a 364-day term credit agreement with a financial
institution to fund the accelerated share repurchase program discussed in Note 14. The term loan
bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin, or an alternate base rate as defined under the term credit
agreement. In May2007, we repaid $500million of the borrowings under the term credit agreement.
The remaining balance of $25billion was repaid in June2007 using available cash and proceeds
from our issuance of long-term notes in June2007 described below. In August2005, we entered into a $15billion five-year bank term loan which was used to partially
finance the Premcor Acquisition. The term loan bore interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points and was
fully repaid by December31, 2005. Other Long-Term Debt In February2007, we redeemed our 925% senior notes for $183million, or 104625% of stated value.
These notes had a carrying amount of $187million on the date of redemption, resulting in a gain
of $4million that was included in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income. In
addition, we made scheduled debt repayments of $230million in April2007 related to our 6125%
notes and $50million in November2007 related to our 6311% CORE notes. 81 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

notes due June15, 2037. Proceeds from the issuance of these notes totaled $2245billion, before
deducting underwriting discounts of $18million. In December2007, we exercised a call provision on our 95% senior notes, which were redeemed on
February1, 2008 for $367million, resulting in a gain of $14million in 2008. During March2006, we made a scheduled debt repayment of $220million related to our 7375% notes.
In addition, during the year ended December31, 2006, we made the following debt payments   
$1million during March2006 related to our 775% notes due in February2012

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Preferred Stock We have 20million shares of preferred stock authorized with a par value of $01 per share. As of
December31, 2007 and 2006, no shares of preferred stock were outstanding. In connection with the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery on July1, 2003, we issued 10
million shares of 2% mandatory convertible preferred stock. The mandatory convertible preferred
stock had a fair value of $22 per share, or an aggregate of $220million. Of this amount, $21
million was attributable to beneficial conversion terms of the preferred stock and was recorded in
additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets, with the remaining $199million
reflected as preferred stock. The resulting $21million preferred stock discount was amortized as
additional preferred stock dividends through June30, 2006, the day before the mandatory conversion
of the preferred stock as discussed below. Each share of convertible preferred stock was convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time
before July1, 2006 into 1982 shares of our common stock. All mandatory convertible preferred
stock not previously converted automatically converted to our common stock on July1, 2006. Upon
automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock on July1, 2006, 1982 shares of common
stock were issued for each share of convertible preferred stock based on the average closing price
of our common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the second trading day prior to July
1, 2006. During 2006 and 2005, 3,164,151 and 6,835,849 shares of the preferred stock were
converted into 6,271,327 and 13,548,636 shares of our common stock, respectively. Prior to the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of the convertible preferred
stock, the number of shares of our common stock included in the calculation of earnings per common
share - assuming dilution for each reporting period was based on the average closing price of our
common stock over the 20-day trading period ending on the second trading day prior to the end of
the reporting period. Common Stock Offerings On September1, 2005, we issued 85million shares of common stock as partial consideration for the
Premcor Acquisition. The common stock issued was recorded at a price of $3741 per share,
representing the average price of our common stock from two days before to two days after the
announcement of the Premcor Acquisition in April2005, resulting in an aggregate recorded amount of
$32billion for the common stock issued. In addition, we issued stock options with a fair value
of $595million. Common Stock Splits On September15, 2005, our board of directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock that
was effected in the form of a stock dividend. The stock dividend was distributed on December15,
2005 to stockholders of record on December2, 2005. In connection with the stock split, our
shareholders approved on December1, 2005 an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to
increase the number of authorized common shares from 600million to 12billion. All share and per share data except par value for 2005 were adjusted to reflect the effect of the
stock split. In addition, the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the
mandatory convertible preferred stock, the exercise of outstanding stock options, and the vesting
of other stock awards, as well as the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under
our various employee benefit plans, were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of
those respective agreements and plans. 85 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Treasury Stock We purchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions to meet our obligations under
employee benefit plans. We also purchase shares of our common stock from our employees and
non-employee directors in connection with the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted
stock, and other stock compensation transactions. On October19, 2006, our board of directors approved a $2billion common stock purchase program.
This authorization was in addition to our existing authorization to purchase shares to offset
dilution created by our employee stock incentive programs. On April25, 2007, our board of
directors approved an amendment to our $2billion common stock purchase program to increase the
authorized purchases under the program to $6billion. Stock purchases under the program are made
from time to time at prevailing prices as permitted by securities laws and other legal
requirements, and are subject to market conditions and other factors. The program does not have a
scheduled expiration date. In conjunction with the increase in our common stock purchase program, we entered into an agreement
with a financial institution to purchase $3billion of our shares under an accelerated share
repurchase program, and in late April2007, 421million shares were purchased under this
agreement. As described in Note 12 above, the purchase of these shares was initially funded with a
364-day term credit agreement, which we subsequently replaced with longer-term financing. The cost
of the shares purchased under this accelerated share repurchase program was to be adjusted at the
expiration of the program, with the final purchase cost based on a discount to the average trading
price of our common stock, weighted by the daily volume of shares traded, during the program
period. Any adjustment to the cost could be paid in cash or stock, at our option. The accelerated share repurchase program was completed on July23, 2007, and we elected to pay in
cash an additional $94million for the shares purchased. This cash payment was deducted from
reported income from continuing operations in calculating earnings per common share from continuing
operations assuming dilution for the year ended December31, 2007 see Note 15. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we purchased 843million, 346million,
and 132million shares of our common stock, respectively, at a cost of $58billion, $20billion,
and $571million, respectively. These purchases were made in connection with the administration of
our employee benefit plans and the $6billion stock purchase program authorized by our board of
directors, including the effect of the accelerated share repurchase program discussed above.
During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we issued 161million, 147million, and
209million shares from treasury, respectively, at an average cost of $6289, $5570, and $2751
per share, respectively, for our employee benefit plans. Through
February22, 2008, we have purchased 49million shares of our common stock at a cost of
$317million during 2008. Common Stock Dividends On January17, 2008, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $012 per common
share payable March12, 2008 to holders of record at the close of business on February13, 2008. 86 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts
reflected in the applicable consolidated balance sheets for the respective periods for the
following reasons   
the amounts shown above exclude changes in cash and temporary cash investments, deferred
income taxes, and current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations, as well
as the effect of certain noncash investing and financing activities discussed below   
previously accrued capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and
contingent earn-out payments are reflected in investing activities in the consolidated
statements of cash flows   
changes in assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale prior to
the sale of the Lima Refinery are reflected in the line item to which the changes relate in
the table above   
the amounts shown above exclude the current assets and current liabilities acquired in
connection with the Premcor Acquisition and certain minor acquisitions in 2005, as well as
the current assets and current liabilities disposed of in connection with the sale of the
Denver Refinery in 2005, all of which are reflected separately in the consolidated
statements of cash flows; and   
certain differences between consolidated balance sheet changes and consolidated
statement of cash flow changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency
denominated amounts at different exchange rates. Noncash investing and financing activities for the year ended December31, 2007 included   
a $158million charge to additional paid-in capital to accrue for purchases of our
common stock in 2007 that were not settled and paid until 2008; and

17. PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility of crude oil and refined product prices,
as well as volatility in the price of natural gas used in our refining operations. To reduce the
impact of this price volatility, we use derivative commodity instruments swaps, futures, and
options to manage our exposure to   
changes in the fair value of a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product
inventories and a portion of our unrecognized firm commitments to purchase these
inventories fair value hedges 90 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued   
changes in cash flows of certain forecasted transactions such as forecasted feedstock
and product purchases, natural gas purchases, and refined product sales cash flow hedges;
and     
price volatility on a portion of our refinery feedstock and refined product inventories
and on certain forecasted feedstock and product purchases, refined product sales, and
natural gas purchases that are not designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges
economic hedges. In addition, we use derivative commodity instruments for trading purposes based on our fundamental
and technical analysis of market conditions. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related to certain of our long-term
debt obligations. We sometimes use interest rate swap agreements to manage our fixed to floating
interest rate position by converting certain fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt. As of December
31, 2007 and 2006, we did not have any interest rate swap agreements. As of December31, 2005, we had interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $10
billion and interest rates ranging from 56% to 60%. All of these swaps were accounted for as
fair value hedges. During the first quarter of 2006, $125million of these interest rate swaps
were settled on their scheduled maturity date. Effective May1, 2006, we terminated the remaining
$875million of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at that date for a payment of $54million.
Substantially all of this payment was deferred and is being amortized to interest expense over the
remaining lives of the debt instruments that were being hedged. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions related to our Canadian operations.
To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and
purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. As of December31,
2007, we had commitments to purchase $507million of U.S. dollars. These commitments matured on or
before January29, 2008, resulting in a 2008 loss of $2million. Current Period Disclosures The net gain lossrecognized in income representing the amount of hedge ineffectiveness was as

The above amounts were included in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. No
component of the derivative instruments gains or losses was excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness. No amounts were recognized in income for hedged firm commitments that no longer
qualify as fair value hedges. During 2005, we recognized in cost of sales approximately $525million of pre-tax losses
resulting from the forward sales of distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil. All
of these forward derivative positions were closed prior to December31, 2005. During 2007, 2006,
and 2005, we recognized in cost of
sales gains lossesof $37million, $4million, and $6 million, respectively, associated with
trading activities. 91 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued For cash flow hedges, gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
consolidated balance sheets are reclassified into cost of sales when the forecasted transactions
affect income. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, we
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized after-tax gains lossesof $11
million, $70million, and $218 million on certain cash flow hedges, primarily related to forward
sales of gasoline and distillates and associated forward purchases of crude oil, with $17million 45million, and $4million of cumulative after-tax gainson cash flow hedges remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive income as of December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The
deferred gains at December31, 2007 will be reclassified into cost of sales in 2008 as a result
of hedged transactions that are forecasted to occur. The amount ultimately realized in income,
however, will differ as commodity prices change. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and
2005, there were no amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income
as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedge accounting. Market and Credit Risk Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into
the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, the risk that future changes in market
conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to
market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors.
Market risks are monitored by a risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk
management policy. Concentrations of customers in the refining industry may impact our overall
exposure to credit risk, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic
or other conditions. We believe that our counterparties will be able to satisfy their obligations
under their price risk management contracts with us. 18. INCOME TAXES Income from continuing operations before income tax expense from domestic and foreign operations

2008 through 2027 We have recorded a valuation allowance as of December31, 2007 and 2006, due to uncertainties
related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred income tax assets, primarily consisting of
certain state net operating losses, state income tax credits, and foreign tax credits, before they
expire. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income in the various
jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be
recoverable. The realization of net deferred income tax assets recorded as of December31, 2007 is
primarily dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in certain states and
foreign source income in the United States. 94 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities
and the respective tax bases of our foreign subsidiaries based on the determination that such
differences are essentially permanent in duration in that the earnings of these subsidiaries are
expected to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. As of December31, 2007, the
cumulative undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries were approximately $39billion. If those
earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested, deferred income taxes would have been
recorded after consideration of foreign tax credits. It is not practicable to estimate the amount
of additional tax that might be payable on those earnings, if distributed. As discussed in Note 1, we adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January1, 2007. We did not
recognize a significant change in our liability for uncertain tax positions as a result of our
implementation of FIN 48; however, certain amounts previously reported in deferred income taxes
were reclassified to other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of January
1, 2007. In accordance with the provisions of FIN 48, prior period amounts were not reclassified. The following is a reconciliation of the change in unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended

Included in the balance as of December31, 2007 are $65million of tax benefits that, if
recognized, would reduce our annual effective tax rate. We do not expect our unrecognized tax
benefits to change significantly over the next 12months. We have elected to classify any interest expense and penalties related to income taxes within
income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income. During the years ended December31,
2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized approximately $1million, $25million, and $12million in
interest and penalties. We had accrued approximately $46million and $45million for the payment
of interest and penalties as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our tax years through 1999 and UDSs tax years through 1998 are closed to adjustment by the
Internal Revenue Service. Valeros separate tax years 2000 and 2001 prior to the UDS Acquisition
are currently under examination. In addition, our tax years 2002 through 2005 are currently under
examination and 95 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Premcors separate tax years 2002 through 2005 are also under examination. During 2007, the
Internal Revenue Service proposed adjustments to our 2002 and 2003 taxable income, including
adjustments related to inventory and depreciation methods. We are protesting the proposed
adjustments and do not expect that the ultimate disposition of these findings will result in a
material change to our financial position or results of operations. We believe that adequate
provisions for income taxes have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements. 19. SEGMENT INFORMATION We have two reportable segments, refining and retail. Our refining segment includes refining
operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation operations.
The retail segment includes company-operated convenience stores, Canadian dealers/jobbers and
truckstop facilities, cardlock facilities, and home heating oil operations. Operations that are
not included in either of the two reportable segments are included in the corporate category. The reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services.
They are managed separately as each business requires unique technology and marketing strategies.
Performance is evaluated based on operating income. Intersegment sales are generally derived from
transactions made at prevailing market rates.

Plans, some of which are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Qualified Plans cover
substantially all employees in the United States and generally provide eligible employees with
retirement income based on years of service and compensation during specific periods. We also have several nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plans Supplemental Plans,
which provide additional pension benefits to executive officers and certain other employees. The
Supplemental Plans and the Qualified Plans are collectively referred to as the Pension Plans. We also provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees, referred to
as other postretirement benefits. Substantially all of our employees may become eligible for these
benefits if, while still working for us, they either reach normal retirement age or take early
retirement. We offer health care benefits through a self-insured plan and, for certain locations,
a health maintenance organization while life insurance benefits are provided through an insurance
company. We fund our postretirement benefits other than pensions on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Individuals who became our employees as a result of an acquisition became eligible for other
postretirement benefits under our plan as determined by the terms of the relevant acquisition
agreement. We assumed certain obligations under various pension and other postretirement benefit plans in
conjunction with the Aruba and Premcor Acquisitions, and in connection with the Kaneb Acquisition
by NuStar 98 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Energy L.P. Our initial obligations under these plans were recorded through purchase accounting as
of the date of each respective acquisition. Our disclosures include net periodic benefit costs related to such
obligations commencing on the date of acquisition. In conjunction with the sale of NuStar GP
Holdings, LLC discussed in Note 9, effective July1, 2006, certain eligible employees of NuStar GP,
LLC ceased participating in our Pension Plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These former
employees became participants in separate employee benefit plans of NuStar GP, LLC. Certain
liabilities related to pension and other postretirement benefits for these participants were
transferred from us to NuStar GP, LLC and are included in the disclosures below as Spin-off of

Equity securities in the Qualified Plans include our common stock in the amounts of approximately
$55million 4% of total Qualified Plan assets and $66million 6% of total Qualified Plan assets
as of December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The investment policies and strategies for the assets of our Qualified Plans incorporate a
diversified approach which is expected to earn long-term returns from capital appreciation and a
growing stream of current income. This approach recognizes that assets are exposed to risk and the
market value of the Qualified Plans assets may fluctuate from year to year. Risk tolerance is
determined based on our financial ability to withstand risk within the investment program and the
willingness to accept return volatility. In line with the investment return objective and risk
parameters, the Qualified Plans mix of assets includes a diversified portfolio of equity and
fixed-income investments. Equity investments include international stocks and a blend of domestic
growth and value stocks of various sizes of capitalization. The aggregate asset allocation is
reviewed on an annual basis. The overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for the Qualified Plans is estimated
using models of asset returns. Model assumptions are derived using historical data given the
assumption that capital markets are informationally efficient. Three methods are used to derive
the long-term expected returns for each asset 101 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued class. Since each method has distinct advantages and
disadvantages and differing results, an equal weighted-average of the methods results is used. Although we have only $2million of minimum required contributions to our Qualified Plans during
2008 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, we expect to use expected available cash to
contribute approximately $100million to our Qualified Plans during 2008. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service and anticipated Medicare
subsidy, as appropriate, are expected to be paid receivedfor the years ending December31 in

Profit-Sharing/Savings Plans Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan We are the sponsor of the Valero Energy Corporation Thrift Plan, which is a defined contribution
plan. Participation in the Thrift Plan is voluntary. Through June30, 2006, employees were
eligible to participate in the plan upon the completion of one month of continuous service.
Effective July1, 2006, participants may participate in the plan as soon as practicable following
enrollment. Thrift Plan participants can make basic contributions up to 8% of their total annual salary, which
includes overtime and cash bonuses. In addition, participants who make a basic contribution of 8%
can also make a supplemental contribution of up to 22% of their total annual salary. We match 75%
of each participants total basic contributions up to 8% based on the participants total annual
salary, excluding cash bonuses. Our contributions to the Thrift Plan for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $38
million, $37million, and $31million, respectively. Valero Savings Plan The Valero Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering our retail store employees. Under
the Valero Savings Plan, participants can contribute from 1% to 30% of their compensation. We
contribute $060 for every $100 of the participants contribution up to 6% of compensation. Our contributions to the Valero Savings Plan were $5million for each of the years ended December
31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Premcor Retirement Savings Plan The Premcor Retirement Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan covering former Premcor
employees who became employees of Valero effective September1, 2005. Under this plan,
participants can contribute from 1% to 50% of their eligible compensation. We contribute 200% of
the first 3% of a participants pre-tax contribution. In addition, we contribute 100% of a
participants pre-tax contribution above 3% up to 6% for certain union participants who contribute
to the plan. 104 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Our contributions to the Premcor Retirement Savings Plan for the years ended December31, 2007 and
2006 were $7million and $9million, respectively, and for the period from September1, 2005 the
date of the Premcor Acquisition to December31, 2005 were $2million. 21. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION As discussed in Note 1, on January1, 2006, we adopted Statement No123R, which requires the
expensing of the fair value of stock compensation awards. Prior to our adoption of Statement No.
123R, we accounted for our employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of
accounting set forth in APB Opinion No25 and related interpretations as permitted by Statement
No123. We have various fixed and performance-based stock compensation plans under which awards have been
granted, which are summarized as follows   
The 2005 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan the OSIP authorizes the grant of various stock
and stock-based awards to our employees and our non-employee directors. Awards available
under the OSIP include options to purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that
vest upon the achievement of an objective performance goal, and restricted stock that vests
over a period determined by our compensation committee. As of December31, 2007, a total
of 18,730,714 shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under the OSIP.   
A non-employee director stock option plan provided our non-employee directors with
grants of stock options to purchase our common stock. Effective January1, 2007, each
director is granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of our common stock upon initial
election to our board of directors. Prior to January1, 2007, the plan provided automatic
grants of stock options upon their election to our board of directors and annual grants of
stock options upon their continued service on the board. These options expire seven years
from the date of grant. Effective April23, 2007, no further options may be granted under
this plan; future option grants would be made under the OSIP.   
Through December31, 2006, our restricted stock plan for non-employee directors provided
non-employee directors, upon their election to the board of directors, a grant of our
common stock valued at $60,000 that vested in three equal annual installments. Effective
January1, 2007, each non-employee director received an annual grant of our common stock
valued at $80,000 that vested in three equal annual installments. Effective January1,
2008, each non-employee director will receive an annual grant of our common stock valued at
$160,000. Vesting will occur based on the number of grants received as follows: i
initial grants will vest in three equal annual installments, iisecond grants will vest
one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date and the remaining two-thirds on the
second anniversary of the grant date, and iiiall grants thereafter will vest 100% on the
first anniversary of the grant date. As of December31, 2007, a total of 251,423 shares of
our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan.   
The 2003 Employee Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of various stock and
stock-related awards to employees and prospective employees. Awards include options to
purchase shares of common stock, performance awards that vest upon the achievement of an
objective performance goal, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock that vests over
a period determined by our compensation committee. As of December31, 2007, a total of
1,602,300 shares of our common stock remained available to be awarded under this plan. In addition, we formerly maintained other stock option and incentive plans under which previously
granted equity awards remain outstanding. No additional grants may be awarded under these plans. 105 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Each of our current stock-based compensation arrangements is discussed below. The tax benefit
realized for tax deductions resulting from exercises and vestings under all of our stock-based
compensation arrangements totaled $313million, $264million, and $278million for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Stock Options Under the terms of our various stock option plans, the exercise price of options granted is not
less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options become
exercisable pursuant to the individual written agreements between the participants and us, usually
in three or five equal annual installments beginning one year after the date of grant, with
unexercised options generally expiring seven or ten years from the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The expected life of options granted is the period of time from the grant
date to the date of expected exercise or other expected settlement. Expected volatility is based
on closing prices of our common stock for periods corresponding to the expected life of options
granted. Expected dividend yield is based on annualized dividends at the date of grant. The
risk-free interest rate used is the implied yield currently available from the U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options at the grant
date. A summary of the weighted-average assumptions used in our fair value measurements is
presented in the table below

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued of stock options exercised during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005
was $881million, $385million, and $297million, respectively. Cash received from stock option exercises for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $130million, $77million, and $152million, respectively. As of December31, 2007, there was $77million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
outstanding unvested stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately two years. Restricted Stock Restricted stock is granted to employees and non-employee directors. Restricted stock granted to
employees vests in accordance with individual written agreements between the participants and us,
usually in equal annual installments over a period of five years beginning one year after the date
of grant. Restricted stock granted to our non-employee directors vests from one to three years
following the date of grant. A summary of the status of our restricted stock awards is presented

As of December31, 2007, there was $51million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
outstanding unvested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of approximately three years. The total fair value of restricted stock
that vested during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $44million, $24million,
and $18million, respectively. Performance Awards We issue to certain key employees performance awards, which represent rights to receive shares of
Valero common stock only upon Valeros achievement of an objective performance measure.
Performance awards are subject to vesting in three annual amounts beginning approximately one year
after the date of grant. The number of common shares earned each year is based on the vested award
adjusted by a factor determined by our total shareholder return over a rolling three-year period
compared to the total shareholder return of a defined peer group for the same time period. During the year ended December31, 2007, 112,820 performance awards were issued and 37,519 awards
were forfeited. The fair value of performance awards subject to vesting for the year ended
December31, 2007 was based on an expected conversion to common shares at a rate of 150% and a
weighted-average fair value of $5262 per share, representing the market price of our common stock
on the grant date reduced by expected dividends over the vesting period. The total fair value of
performance awards that vested during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $11
million, $263million, and $15million, respectively. 107 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Restricted Stock Units As of December31, 2007, 100,812 unvested restricted stock units were outstanding. Restricted
stock units vest in equal annual amounts over a three-year or five-year period beginning one year
after the date of grant. These restricted stock units are payable in cash based on the price of
our common stock on the date of vesting, and therefore they are accounted for as liability-based
awards under Statement No123R. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, cash
payments of $8million, $25million, and $24million, respectively, were made for vested restricted
stock units. During the year ended December31, 2007, 15,920 restricted stock units were granted
and 430 units were forfeited. Based on the price of our common stock on December31, 2007, the
fair value of the unvested restricted stock units was $7million, of which $6million was
recognized as of December31, 2007. 22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases We have long-term operating lease commitments for land, office facilities, retail facilities and
related equipment, transportation equipment, time charters for ocean-going tankers and coastal
vessels, dock facilities, and various facilities and equipment used in the storage, transportation,
production, and sale of refinery feedstocks and refined products. Certain leases for processing equipment and feedstock and refined product storage facilities
provide for various contingent payments based on, among other things, throughput volumes in excess
of a base amount. Certain leases for vessels contain renewal options and escalation clauses, which
vary by charter, and provisions for the payment of chartering fees, which either vary based on
usage or provide for payments, in addition to established minimums, that are contingent on usage.
Leases for convenience stores may also include provisions for contingent rental payments based on
sales volumes. In most cases, we expect that in the normal course of business, our leases will be
renewed or replaced by other leases. As of December31, 2007, our future minimum rentals and minimum rentals to be received under
subleases for leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year
were as reflected in the following table in millions.

Other Commitments We have various purchase obligations under certain industrial gas and chemical supply arrangements
such as hydrogen supply arrangements, crude oil and other feedstock supply arrangements, and
various throughput and terminalling agreements. We enter into these contracts to ensure an
adequate supply of utilities and feedstock and adequate storage capacity to operate our refineries.
Substantially all of our purchase obligations are based on market prices or adjustments based on
market indices. Certain of these purchase obligations include fixed or minimum volume
requirements, while others are based on our usage requirements. None of these obligations are
associated with suppliers financing arrangements. These purchase obligations are not reflected in
the consolidated balance sheets. Accounts Receivable Sales Facility As discussed in Note 4, as of December31, 2007, we had an accounts receivable sales facility with
a group of third-party financial institutions to sell on a revolving basis up to $1billion of
eligible trade receivables, which matures in August2008. During the third quarter of 2007, we
reduced the amount of eligible receivables sold to the third-party financial institutions by $900
million. As a result, as of December31, 2007, the amount of eligible receivables sold to the
third-party financial institutions was $100million. Contingent Earn-Out Agreements In connection with our acquisitions of Basis Petroleum, Inc. in 1997 and the St. Charles Refinery
in 2003, the sellers were entitled to receive payments in any of the ten and seven years,
respectively, following these acquisitions if certain average refining margins during any of those
years exceeded a specified level. In connection with the Premcor Acquisition in 2005, we assumed
Premcors obligation under a contingent earn-out agreement related to Premcors acquisition of the
Delaware City Refinery from Motiva Enterprises LLC Motiva. Under this agreement, Motiva was
entitled to receive two separate annual earn-out payments depending on athe amount of crude oil
processed at the refinery and the level of refining margins through May2007, and bthe
achievement of certain performance criteria at the gasification facility through May2006. As
described below, final payments under all of these agreements have been made, and, consequently,
our obligations have been fulfilled under the agreements. 109 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued The following table summarizes the aggregate payments we had made through December31, 2007 and
payment limitations related to the following acquisitions in millions. The amounts reflected for
the Delaware City Refinery represent amounts applicable only to the throughput/margin earn-out
contingency since the earn-out contingency related to the refinerys gasification facility expired
during the second quarter of 2006 with no payment required. The amounts reflected represent only
amounts for which we were potentially liable subsequent to the Premcor Acquisition.

For the acquisition of Basis Petroleum, Inc., we accounted for payments under this arrangement as
an additional cost of the acquisition when the payments were made. Of the aggregate payments made
related to this acquisition, $47million was attributed to property, plant and equipment and is
being depreciated over the remaining lives of the assets to which the additional cost was allocated
and $153million was attributed to goodwill and is not being amortized. As part of the purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery, a
liability was accrued for the aggregate limit of potential earn-out payments totaling $175million.
The offsetting amount was reflected in property, plant and equipment and is being depreciated
over the remaining lives of the assets to which the cost was allocated. In January2008, we made a
final earn-out payment of $25million related to the acquisition of the St. Charles Refinery. In connection with the Premcor Acquisition, a liability of $50million was accrued as of September
1, 2005 as we believed it was probable that the maximum payments would be made related to the
Delaware City Refinery margin contingency. The offsetting amount was recorded in goodwill. A
final payment under this agreement was made in June2007. Insurance Recoveries During the third quarter of 2005, certain of our refineries experienced property damage and
business interruption losses associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. As a result of these
losses, we submitted claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. During 2005,
we recorded a receivable related to our property damage claims, which was recorded as a reduction
of repair and maintenance expense. No amounts related to the potential business interruption
insurance recoveries were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year
ended December31, 2005 due to various outstanding claim contingencies existing between us and our
insurance carriers. During 2006, we reached a final business 110 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued interruption settlement with our insurance carriers, the proceeds from which were recorded as a
reduction to cost of sales. Amounts received or to be received for these matters were immaterial
to our results of operations and financial position. During the first quarter of 2007, our McKee Refinery was shut down due to a fire originating in its
propane deasphalting unit, resulting in business interruption losses for which we have submitted
claims to our insurance carriers under our insurance policies. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we
received an immaterial initial payment from the insurance carriers on our claims, the proceeds from
which were recorded as a reduction to cost of sales. No additional amount has been accrued
related to these claims pending future settlements with the insurance carriers. Tax Matters We are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, and foreign income taxes and
transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding, and ad valorem
taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are
continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax
liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the
respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits
may subject us to interest and penalties. Effective January1, 2007, the GOA enacted a turnover tax on revenues from the sale of goods
produced and services rendered in Aruba. The turnover tax, which is 3% for on-island sales and
services and 1% on export sales, is being assessed by the GOA on sales by our Aruba Refinery.
However, due to a previous tax holiday that was granted to our Aruba Refinery by the GOA through
December31, 2010 as well as other reasons, we believe that exports by our Aruba Refinery should
not be subject to this turnover tax. No amounts have been accrued on exports with respect to this
turnover tax. We have commenced arbitration proceedings with the Netherlands Arbitration Institute
pursuant to which we will seek to enforce our rights under the tax holiday. We have also filed
protests of these assessments through proceedings in Aruba. Aruba Refinery Fire On January25, 2008, our Aruba Refinery experienced a fire in its vacuum unit. We are in the
process of making the necessary repairs and we resumed partial operation of the refinery in
mid-February. We expect to resume full operations in the second quarter of 2008. Although we have
not completed our assessment of the extent of damages, we do not believe that this incident will
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for 2008. 23. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Remediation Liabilities Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Other than for
assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of
investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action. Environmental
liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently
available technology and applying current regulations, as well as our own internal environmental
policies. 111 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

In connection with our various acquisitions, we assumed certain environmental liabilities
including, but not limited to, certain remediation obligations, site restoration costs, and certain
liabilities relating to soil and groundwater remediation. We believe that we have adequately provided for our environmental exposures with the accruals
referred to above. These liabilities have not been reduced by potential future recoveries from
third parties. Environmental liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown
factors such as the timing and extent of remediation, the determination of our obligation in
proportion to other parties, improvements in remediation technologies, and the extent to which
environmental laws and regulations may change in the future. 24. LITIGATION MATTERS MTBE Litigation As of February1, 2008, we were named as a defendant in 83 cases alleging liability related to MTBE
contamination in groundwater. The plaintiffs are generally water providers, governmental
authorities, and private water companies alleging that refiners and marketers of MTBE and gasoline
containing MTBE are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. We have been
named in these lawsuits together with many other refining industry companies. We are being sued
primarily as a refiner and marketer of MTBE and gasoline containing MTBE. We do not own or operate
gasoline station facilities in most of the geographic locations in which damage is alleged to have
occurred. The lawsuits generally seek individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages,
injunctive relief, and attorneys fees. Although most of the cases are pending in federal court
and consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York Multi-District Litigation Docket No1358, In re:
Methyl-Tertiary Butyl Ether Products Liability Litigation, a 2007 ruling on jurisdiction from the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit has 112 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued resulted in a remand of two cases to state court People of the State of New
Hampshire and People of the State of California. Discovery is now open in all cases. One of the
cases originally deemed a focus case for discovery and pre-trial proceedings, the Suffolk County
Water Authority case, is scheduled for trial in September2008. We believe that we have strong
defenses to these claims and are vigorously defending the cases. We have recorded a loss
contingency liability with respect to this matter in accordance with FASB Statement No5.
However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we believe that it is reasonably possible
as defined in FASB Statement No5 that we may suffer a loss with respect to one or more of the
lawsuits in excess of the amount accrued. We believe that such an outcome in any one of these
lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
position. However, we believe that an adverse result in all or a substantial number of these cases
could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position. An estimate of
the possible loss or range of loss from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these
cases cannot reasonably be made. Retail Fuel Temperature Litigation Along with several other defendants in the retail petroleum marketing business, as of February1,
2008, we were named in 22 consumer class action lawsuits relating to fuel temperature. The
complaints, filed in federal courts in several states, allege that because fuel volume increases
with fuel temperature, the defendants have violated state consumer protection laws by failing to
adjust the volume of fuel when the fuel temperature exceeded 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The complaints
seek to certify classes of retail consumers who purchased fuel in various locations. The
complaints seek an order compelling the installation of temperature correction devices as well as
associated monetary relief. In June2007, the federal lawsuits were consolidated into a
multi-district litigation case in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas
Multi-District Litigation Docket No1840, In re: Motor Fuel Temperature Sales Practices
Litigation. In February2008, the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss the complaints.
We believe that we have several strong defenses to these lawsuits and intend to contest them. We
have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to this matter, but due to the inherent
uncertainty of litigation, we believe that it is reasonably possible as defined in FASB Statement
No5 that we may suffer a loss with respect to one or more of the lawsuits. An estimate of the
possible loss or range of loss from an adverse result in all or substantially all of these cases
cannot reasonably be made. Rosolowski Rosolowski v. Clark Refining Marketing, Inc., et al., Judicial Circuit Court, Cook County,
Illinois Case No95-L 014703. We assumed this class action lawsuit in the Premcor Acquisition.
The lawsuit, filed in 1995, relates in part to a release to the atmosphere of spent catalyst
containing low levels of metals from the now-closed Blue Island, Illinois refinery in 1994. The
case was certified as a class action in 2000 with three classes, two of which received nominal or
no damages, and one of which received a sizeable jury verdict. That class consisted of local
residents who claimed property damage or loss of use and enjoyment of their property over a period
of several years. In November2005, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs of $801
million in compensatory damages and $40million in punitive damages. However, following our
motions for new trial and judgment notwithstanding the verdict citing, among other things,
misconduct by plaintiffs counsel and improper class certification, the trial judge in November
2006 vacated the jurys award and decertified the class. Plaintiffs have appealed the courts
decision to vacate the $120million judgment and decertify the class. Oral arguments on
plaintiffs appeal were heard before the state appeals court on February20, 2008. We have
recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to this matter in accordance with FASB Statement No5. We do not believe that this matter will have a material
effect on our financial position or results of operations. 113 Table of Contents VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

our consolidated results of operations or financial position. 25. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION In conjunction with the Premcor Acquisition on September1, 2005, Valero Energy Corporation has

a reduction resulting from a $94million cash payment upon the completion of our accelerated
share repurchase program, as discussed in Note 14.   d
Net income and per share amounts include a pre-tax gain of $132million and $196million in
the third and fourth quarter, respectively, resulting from the sale of our ownership interest
