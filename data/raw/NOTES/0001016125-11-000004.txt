We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December31, 2010 and 2009 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.Nature of Operations The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. and subsidiaries Ultimate, we, us or our is a leading provider of unified human capital management HCM software-as-a-service SaaS solutions for global businesses.Ultimate solutions are marketed as two solution suites based on company size.UltiPro Enterprise Enterprise is designed to address the needs of companies with 1,000 or more employees.UltiPro Workplace Workplace is designed for companies with fewer than 1,000 employees.UltiPro is marketed primarily through our Enterprise and Workplace direct sales teams. 2.Basis of Presentation, Consolidation and the Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Ultimate have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC. The consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of Ultimates management, necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include the valuation of deferred tax assets and long-lived assets and the fair value of stock-based compensation.Actual results could differ from those estimates. The consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Ultimate and include its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated statements of cash flows reflect the reclassification of excess tax benefits from employee stock plan and shares acquired to settle employee tax withholding liabilities from cash flows from operating activities to cash flows from financing activities. These reclassifications are immaterial to the presentation of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The presentation of the consolidated statements of operations has been modified to conform with reporting requirements for discontinued operations.See Note 4 below for further explanation. 3.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered cash equivalents and are comprised of interest-bearing accounts. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are principally from end-users of Ultimates products. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and have recorded allowances for estimated losses. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required when the realization of receivables is assessed, including assessing the probability of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required.  40 Table of Contents Funds Held for Customers and Customers Funds Obligations Ultimates UltiPro Tax Filing product provides tax filing services to our customers.These tax filing services are being sold directly by us to our customers only on a per-employee-per-month PEPM basis in conjunction with UltiPro, our core product.In connection with our UltiPro Tax Filing product, we receive funds from our customers and hold such funds for purposes of paying the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of such customers.We hold our customers tax filing deposits for the period between collection from our customers and remittance to the applicable taxing authority.These funds held for customers and the corresponding customer funds obligations are included in current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets as
of December 31, 2010 and 2009.We have reported the cash flows related to the purchases of overnight repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury or U.S. Government Agency securities using funds received from UltiPro Tax Filing customers in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.We have reported the cash flows related to the funds received and paid on behalf of such customers to the applicable taxing authorities in the financing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.The associated PEPM fees for UltiPro Tax Filing are included in recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.Since the initial introduction of UltiPro Tax Filing during 2008, the associated interest earned was not material for the years ended December 31, 2010
, 2009 and 2008. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Ultimates financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities, funds held for customers and the related obligations, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and capital lease obligations, approximated fair value as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is subject to an impairment test at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment might exist.Intangible assets with definite lives must be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment.We completed our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of December 31, 2010 and determined goodwill had not been impaired as of December 31, 2010.Our acquired intangible assets with finite lives will be fully amortized in 2011. Long-Lived Assets We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment exist.For the year ended December 31, 2010, no such events or circumstances were identified.The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the undiscounted expected future cash flows from such asset or asset group are separately identifiable and less than the assets or asset groups carrying value.In that event, a loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset.Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded no impair
ment of our long-lived assets. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to fifteen years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset or the term of the lease over periods ranging from three to fifteen years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of deferrals for recurring revenues for SaaS services which are recognized over the term of the related contract as the services are performed, typically two years; maintenance services which have not yet been rendered; implementation consulting services for which the services have not yet been rendered; and subscription revenues which are recognized ratably over the minimum term of the related contract upon the delivery of the product and services. Guarantees The standard commercial terms in our sales contracts for UltiPro include an indemnification clause that indemnifies the customer against certain liabilities and damages arising from any claims of patent, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any third party. Due to the nature of the intellectual property indemnification provided to our customers, we cannot estimate the fair value, or determine the total nominal amount, of the indemnification until such time as a claim for such indemnification is made.In the event of a claim made against us under such provision, we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnification considering such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.To date, Ultimate has not had any claims made again
st it under such provision and, accordingly, has not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in its consolidated financial statements.  41 Table of Contents Segment Information Public companies are required to report selected information about operating segments in annual and interim financial reports to shareholders, as well as, related disclosures about an enterprises business segments, products, services, geographic areas and major customers. Ultimate operates its business as a single segment. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are generated from the delivery of our SaaS Offering including the right to use UltiPro and software maintenance services, professional services and, to a much lesser degree, the sale of software licenses. We recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the fees are fixed and determinable; and collection is considered probable. If collection is not considered probable, we recognize revenues when the fees are collected. If the fees are not fixed and determinable, we recognize revenues when the fees become due from the customer. If non-standard acceptance periods or non-standard performance criteria are required, we recognize revenue when the acceptance period expires or upon the satisfaction of the acceptance/performance criteria, as applicable. Recurring Revenues Recurring revenues consist of subscription revenues recognized from our SaaS offering of UltiPro the SaaS Offering, as well as customer support and maintenance revenues. i Subscription revenues are principally derived from PEPM fees earned from the SaaS Offering and from sales of hosting services on a stand-alone basis to customers who already own a perpetual license Base Hosting. To the extent there are upfront or setup fees associated with our SaaS Offering, subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related contract, commencing when the customer processes its first payroll using UltiPro also referred to as going Live. Ongoing PEPM fees from the SaaS Offering and Base Hosting are recognized as subscription revenues as the services are delivered commencing when the customer goes Live. ii Customer support and maintenance revenues are derived from maintaining, supporting, andproviding periodic updates of our software for our hosting services. Under our SaaS Offering, our customers do not have the right to take possession of our software and these arrangements are considered service contracts. SaaS revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term, commencing upon the delivery of the product and services, which is when the customer goes Live. Fair value of multiple elements in SaaS arrangements is derived for each element based on the guidance provided by Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition.The multiple elements that typically exist in SaaS arrangements include hosting services, the right to use UltiPro, maintenance of UltiPro i.e., product enhancements and updates and customer support and professional services i.e., primarily implementation services. The pricing for the three elements that pertain to recurring revenues i.e., hosting services, the right to use UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro is bundled.Since these three bundled elements are components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, allocation of fair values to each of the three elements is not necessary and they are not reported separately.Fair value for the bundled elements, as a whole, is determined on the basis of renewal pricing, not taking into consideration potential price increases or changes in the number of underlying employees caused by eventual changes in the size of the customer in the future due to the uncertainties surrounding these future occurrences.These bundled elements are provided on an ongoing basis, represent undelivered elements and ar
e recognized on a monthly basis as the related services are performed, commencing once the customer goes Live. If evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue for the total arrangement is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established.  42 Table of Contents Services Revenues Services revenues primarily include revenues from fees charged for the implementation of our product solutions and, to a lesser extent, training of customers in the use of our products and fees for other services, including the provision of payroll-related forms and the printing of Forms W-2 for certain customers, as well as certain reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses.Revenues from implementation services comprise the majority of total services revenues. Revenues from implementation consulting services billed on a time and materials basis at an hourly rate are recognized as these services are performed based on their relative fair values.The total arrangement consideration is allocated to service elements in the arrangement based on their relative fair values, using the prices established when the services are sold on a stand-alone basis.Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as the services are rendered, depending on the specific terms of the related arrangement. Revenues from implementation consulting services sold on a fixed-fee basis are recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the use of estimates.Percentage of completion is measured at each reporting date based on progress made to date compared to the total estimate to complete the implementation job. License Revenues From our inception through March 31, 2009, we sold perpetual licenses of UltiPro which resulted in license revenues recognized for that period of time.Customer support and maintenance revenues, from previously sold perpetual license deals, are derived from maintaining, supporting, and providing periodic updates of our software.Maintenance fees are generally priced as a percentage of the initial perpetual license fee for the underlying products.Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the service period, generally one year, and are included in recurring revenues.Annual maintenance renewal fees which occur subsequent to the initial contract period are also recognized ratably over the related service period. While we still sell on-site licenses of UltiPro, sales to new customers are only on a subscription basis priced and billed to our customers on a PEPM basis.Effective April 1, 2009, we no longer sell our on-site UltiPro solutions to new customers on a perpetual license basis. We do sell licenses to existing license customers but only in relation to the customers employee growth or for products complementary to UltiPro for which they already have a perpetual license. Any such licenses are recognized as license revenues in our consolidated financial statements upon the delivery of the related software product when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues primarily consists of the costs of recurring and services revenues. Cost of recurring revenues primarily consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support to our customers, the cost of providing periodic updates and the cost of recurring subscription revenues, including amortization of capitalized software. Cost of services revenues primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services and, to a lesser degree, training to our customers, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms and costs associated with certain client reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Stock-Based Compensation Our Amended and Restated 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan the Plan authorizes the grant of options to non-employee directors, officers and employees of Ultimate to purchase shares of the Ultimates Common Stock.The Plan also authorizes the grant to such persons of restricted and non-restricted shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units and cash performance awards collectively, together with stock options, the Awards.Prior to the adoption of the Plan, options to purchase shares of Common Stock were issued under our Nonqualified Stock Option Plan the Prior Plan.Beginning in 2009, we began making grants to employees of restricted stock units in lieu of stock options. As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan and the Prior Plan was 12,500,000 and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that were available to be issued under all Awards granted under the Plan was 915,628 shares. The Plan provides broad discretion to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to create appropriate equity incentives for directors, officers and employees of Ultimate.The Plan is intended to attract and retain talented employees and align employee and stockholder interests. For purposes of calculating and accounting for stock-based compensation expense SBC in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 for stock options, Ultimate makes a computation of expected volatility, based upon historical volatility and the expected term of the option.The expected term is based on the historical exercise experience under the stock-based plans of the underlying award including post-vesting employment termination behavior and represents the period of time the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding.The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates
in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The weighted-average forfeiture rate is based on historical data.  43 Table of Contents Rental Costs Incurred in Relation to a Construction Period We have incurred rental costs associated with operating leases during the construction period.Rental costs incurred during a construction period are costs incurred for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a leased asset.Since there is no distinction between the right to use a leased asset during the construction period and the right to use that asset after the construction period, rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense on a straight-line basis. Income Taxes We are subject to corporate Federal, foreign and state income taxes.We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach under which deferred income taxes are provided based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable. We make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes.These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We assess the likelihood that Ultimate will be able to recover its deferred tax assets.Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expiration of net operating losses, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, as well as current tax laws and interpretation of current tax laws, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.If recovery is not likely, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable.The available positive evidence at December 31, 2010 included, among other factors, three years of historical operating profits and a proje
ction of future financial and taxable income including the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets.As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, at December 31, 2010, it was considered more likely than not that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not required. See Note 14 for further discussion. Effective January 1, 2007, ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740, clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements.Specifically, ASC 740 prescribed a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.ASC 740 also provides guidance on the related derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting for interim periods, disclosure and transition of uncertain tax positions.We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of our income tax provision. We did not have any interest and penalties accrued upon the adoption of ASC 740, and, as of December
31, 2010, we did not have any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits. Reimbursable Out-Of-Pocket Expenses Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses, which are included in services revenues and cost of services revenues in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, were $10 million, $13 million and $18 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In January 2010, we adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2009-05, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820-Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value ASU 2009-05.ASU 2009-05, which amends ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, allows companies determining the fair value of a liability to use the perspective of an investor that holds the related obligation as an asset.The amendment addresses practice difficulties caused by the tension between fair-value measurements based on the price that would be paid to transfer a liability to a new obligor and contractual or legal requirements that prevent such transfers from taking place.The adoption of ASU 2009-05 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, we adopted ASU 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic 820-Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ASU 2010-06.ASU 2010-06 provides amendments to Subtopic 820-10 that a require new disclosures as follows: 1 transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 and 2 activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, and b clarify existing disclosures as follows:1 level of disaggregation requiring a reporting entity to provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities, and 2 disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements for Levels 2 and 3.The adoption of ASU 2010-06 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February 2010, we adopted ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events Topic 855 ASU 2010-09.ASU 2010-09 provides amendments to Subtopic 855-10 as follows: a updates the date subsequent events are evaluated depending on the registrants classification; b adds the definition of SEC filer; c removes the requirement of disclosing the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated; d removes the definition of public entity; and e changes the scope of the reissuance disclosure requirements.We evaluated events that occurred subsequent to December 31, 2010 and determined that there were no recordable or reportable subsequent events.  44 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1.ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1 amends ASC Subtopic 605-25, Revenue Recognition-Multiple-Element Arrangements ASC Subtopic 605-25, which sets forth requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple-element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered. ASC Subtopic 605-25 requires that there be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items which must be supported by either vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE or third-party evidence TPE. ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1 will eliminate the requirement that all undelivered elements have VSOE or TPE before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered.In the absence of VSOE or TPE of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple-element arrangement, entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements.The overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices, regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by VSOE or TPE or are based on the entitys estimated selling price.Application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrange
ment fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted upon adoption of ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1.Additionally, the new guidance will require entities to disclose more information about their multiple-element revenue arrangements.ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1 is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010.We have evaluated the impact of ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1 and determined the adoption of ASU 2009-13 EITF 08-1 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 4.Discontinued Operations During the year ended December 31, 2010, Ultimate discontinued and liquidated the operations of The Ultimate Software Group UK Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom the UK Subsidiary. Discontinued operations, net of income taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 resulted in a loss of $09 million, $03 million and $03 million, respectively.The loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, of $09 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, was principally from the realization of a non-cash foreign currency translation adjustment.The discontinuation of the operations of the UK Subsidiary was completed as of September 30, 2010. The financial results of discontinued operations of the UK Subsidiary are as follows in thousands  For the Years Ended December 31  2010 2009 2008  Total revenues 51 299 575   Pretax loss from UK Subsidiary operations 85 472 475 Loss from disposal of UK Subsidiary primarily for foreign currency translation adjustment 912 Pretax loss from discontinued operations 997 472 475 Income tax benefit 144 136 143 Loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes 853 336 332  The assets and liabilities of the UK Subsidiary were immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, and, therefore, are not presented separately.  45 Table of Contents 5.Investments in Marketable Securities and Fair Value of Financial Instruments We classify our investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values as  securities consist of debt and equity securities not classified as trading securities or as securities to be held to maturity.Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as a net amount in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity until realized.Gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities are determined using the specific identification method.Included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $7 thousand of unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities and $6 thousand of unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, resp
ectively. The amortized cost, net unrealized gain loss and fair value of our investments in marketable available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 are shown below in thousands  As of December 31, 2010 As of December 31, 2009  Net Net  Amortized Unrealized Fair Amortized Unrealized Fair  Cost Gain Value Cost Gain Value  Corporate debentures bonds 2,903 4 2,907 3,025 3 3,028 Commercial paper 2,599 2,599 1,499 1,499 U.S. Agency bonds 1,513 1 1,514 1,407 1 1,408 U.S. Treasury bills 1,504 2 1,506 1,995 2 1,997 U.S. Treasury bonds 501 501 Non U.S. government bond 301 301 Certificates of deposit 490 490 1,090 1,090 Total investments 9,310 7 9,317 9,517 6 9,523 The amortized cost and fair value of the marketable available-for-sale securities by contractual maturity at December 31, 2010 is shown below in thousands  As of December 31, 2010  Amortized Fair  Cost Value  Due in one year or less 8,877 8,884 Due after one year 433 433 Total 9,310 9,317 We classify and disclose fair value measurements in one of the following three categories of fair value hierarchy  Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities.  Level 2 Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.  Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. A financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assets that are measured by management at fair value on a recurring basis are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.The types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include most money market securities and certificates of deposit.Such instruments are generally classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.We did not have any significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  46 Table of Contents The types of instruments valued by management based on quoted prices in less active markets, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency, include Ultimates corporate debentures and bonds, commercial paper, U.S. agency bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, U.S. Treasury bonds and non U.S. government bonds.Such instruments are generally classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.Ultimate uses consensus pricing, which is based on multiple pricing sources, to value its fixed income investments. The following table sets forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 in thousands  As of December 31, 2010 As of December 31, 2009  Quoted Quoted  Prices in Other Un Prices in Other Un  Active Observable Observable Active Observable Observable  Markets Inputs Inputs Markets Inputs Inputs  Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Corporate debentures and bonds 2,907 2,907 3,028 3,028 Commercial paper 2,599 2,599 1,499 1,499 U.S. Agency bonds 1,514 1,514 1,408 1,408 U.S. Treasury bills 1,506 1,506 1,997 1,997 U.S. Treasury bond 501 501 International government bond 301 301 Certificates of deposit 490 490 1,090 1,090 Total 9,317 490 8,827 9,523 1,090 8,433 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were presented in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 and as of December 31, 2009 as short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities.There were no financial liabilities accounted for at fair value as of December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  47 Table of Contents 6.Property and Equipment Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands  As of December 31  2010 2009 Computer equipment 66,735 59,234 Leasehold improvements 9,134 8,307 Furniture and fixtures 3,960 3,592 Building 929 929 Land 655 655 Property and equipment 81,413 72,717 Less:accumulated depreciation and amortization 63,338 53,221 Property and equipment, net 18,075 19,496 Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment totaled $103 million, $103 million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Included in property and equipment is computer equipment acquired under capital leases as follows in thousands  As of December 31  2010 2009 Computer equipment 22,799 18,946 Less:accumulated amortization 19,457 16,936  3,342 2,010 Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment under capital leases totaled $25 million, $24 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  48 Table of Contents 7.Foreign Currency The financial statements of Ultimates foreign subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars.The functional currency of our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Ultimate Software Group of Canada, Inc., is the Canadian dollar and the functional currency of the discontinued UK Subsidiary was the British pound.Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates.Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the reporting period.The resulting non-cash foreign currency translation adjustments, representing unrealized gains or losses, are included in consolidated stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss.Realized gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are i
ncluded in total operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, Ultimate had a realized foreign currency translation loss of $09 million, included in loss from discontinued operations for its UK Subsidiary.There was no realized foreign currency translation gain or loss from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.For the year ended December 31, 2010, Ultimate had a cumulative unrealized translation gain of $01 million.For the year ended December 31, 2009, Ultimate had a cumulative unrealized translation loss of $07 million. 8.Software Development Costs We capitalize certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. Based on Ultimates product development process, technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. There were no research and development expenses capitalized in 2010.During 2009 and 2008, a total of $01 million and $08 million, respectively, of research and development expenses were capitalized in relation to UltiPro Onboarding, which is a product that handles certain human resources functionality for new hires of a company, and had its general release in the first quarter of 2009.Annual amortization is based on the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues f
or the related product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on. Capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are typically five years. Amortization of capitalized software was $13 million, $13 million and $07 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and is included within cost of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Accumulated amortization of capitalized software was $82 million, $69 million and $57 million as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capitalized software, net of amortization, was $31 million, $45 million and $56 million as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Ultimate evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated costs of completing the products and of performing maintenance and customer support.If Ultimates gross revenues were to be significantly less than its estimates, the net realizable value of Ultimates capitalized software intended for sale would be impaired, which could result in the write-off of all or a portion of the unamortized balance of such capitalized software. 9.Earnings Per Share Earnings per share calculations require a dual presentation basic and diluted. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders the numerator by the weighted average number of common shares the denominator for the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. The following is a reconciliation of the shares used in the computation of basic and diluted net income loss per share in thousands  For the Years Ended
December 31  2010 2009 2008 Basic weighted average shares outstanding 24,960 24,463 24,588 Effect of dilutive equity instruments 2,141 Dilutive shares outstanding 27,101 24,463 24,588  Options to purchase shares of Common Stock and other stock-based awards outstanding which are not included in the calculation of diluted income loss per share because their impact is anti-dilutive 25 6,161 5,927  49 Table of Contents 10.Comprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss represents all changes in equity that result from transactions and other economic events in a period other than transactions with owners. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, as presented in the consolidated balance sheets, consists of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of any related income tax. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we realized a non-cash foreign currency translation adjustment for the discontinued operations of our UK Subsidiary.This was recorded in discontinued operations and represents the reclassification of prior period net unrealized losses from other comprehensive income loss.There was no foreign currency translation adjustment for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Comprehensive income loss for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was as follows in thousands  For the Years Ended  December 31  2010 2009 2008  Net income loss 1 2,157 1,142 2,897 Other comprehensive income loss Realized foreign currency translation adjustment

As of December 31, 2010, Ultimates intangible assets have estimated useful lives and are classified in other assets, net, in our consolidated balance sheet as follows in thousands  Estimated Balance as of Balance as of  Useful Lives December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 Acquired intangible assets Developed technology 1 year 82 192 Customer relationships 170 Due to discontinuing the operations of the UK Subsidiary, the amortization of intangible assets related to customer relationships was accelerated during 2010.There were no changes made to the amortization of the developed technology intangible asset as this technology has been and will continue to be leveraged into the UltiPro suite of products. Amortization expense for the acquired intangible assets reflected above was $281 thousand, $221 thousand and $185 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.Future amortization expense for acquired intangible assets is as follows, as of December 31, 2010 in thousands Year Amount 2011 82 Total 82  51 Table of Contents 12.Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consist of the following in thousands  As of December 31  2010 2009 Sales commissions and performance-based bonuses 4,420 2,974 Other items individually less than 5% of total current liabilities 6,654 6,998  11,074 9,972  13.Capital Lease Obligations We lease certain equipment under non-cancelable agreements, which are accounted for as capital leases and expire at various dates through 2013. Interest rates on these leases range from 425% to 60%. The scheduled lease payments of the capital lease obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2010 in thousands Year Amount 2011 2,717 2012 1,806 2013 678  5,201 Less amount representing interest 244 Lease obligations reflected as current $2,551 and
non-current $2,406 4,957 14.Income Taxes For the year ended December 31, 2010, income tax provision of $52 million was based on income from continuing operations before income taxes of $82 million.For the year ended December 31, 2009, income tax provision of $07 million was based on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $01 million.For the year ended December 31, 2008, income tax benefit of $10 million was based on loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $36 million.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The income tax provision benefit consists of the following in thousands  For the Year Ended December 31  2010 2009 2008 Current taxes Federal 7,276 State and Local 1,408 24 45 Foreign 102 Deferred taxes, net Federal 3,094 369 931 State and Local 564 29 337 Foreign 33 299 207 Income tax provision benefit, net 5,161 721 1,016 The income tax provision benefit is different from that which would be obtained by applying the statutory Federal income tax rate of 35% to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes as a result of the following in thousands  For the Year Ended December 31  2010 2009 2008 Income tax provision benefit expense at statutory Federal tax rate 2,860 30 1,254 State and local income taxes 548 20 169 Non deductible expenses 1,782 662 380 Change in tax rates 27 34 2 Change in foreign valuation allowance 85 103 65 Other, net 83 40 Income tax provision benefit, net 5,161 721 1,016  52 Table of Contents Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.Deferred tax assets are also recorded for the future tax benefit of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 were as follows in thousands  As of December 31  2010 2009 2008  Deferred tax assets Net operating losses 4,886 6,515 Tax credit carryforwards 127 224 224 Deferred revenue 3,362 3,849 7,515 Accruals not currently deductible 239 213 129 Allowance for doubtful accounts 292 233 272 Charitable contributions 264 234 251 Stock-based compensation 21,258 17,608 13,168 Deferred rent adjustment 1,171 1,235 1,188 Gross deferred tax assets 26,713 28,482 29,262 Less valuation allowance 4,972 5,657 Deferred tax assets 26,713 23,510 23,605  Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment 1,836 1,391 1,057 Acquired intangible assets 32 141 227 Software development costs 415 1,099 1,417 Other, net 8 15 28 Gross deferred tax liabilities 2,291 2,646 2,729  Net deferred tax assets 24,422 20,864 20,876 Ultimate considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expiration of net operating loss carryforwards, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income, ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and reversal of deferred tax liabilities in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If it is not more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. The available positive evidence at December 31, 2010, included, among other factors, three years of historical operating profits and a projection of future financial and taxable income by jurisdiction including the estimated impact of future tax deductions from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units sufficient to realize most of our remaining deferred tax assets. As a result of our analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we believe that is it more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2010 will be realized in the future. The net decrease in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $50 million, $47 million relating primarily to the recognition of stock-based payment deductions in stockholders equity and a $03 million decrease relating to foreign operations.The net decrease in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $07 million, comprised of an $08 million decrease primarily relating to the recognition of stock-based payment deductions in stockholders equity, partially offset by a $01 million increase relating to foreign operations. Management continues to apply the Exception to the Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary, Ultimate Canada.The Comprehensive Recognition of Deferred Income Taxes presumes that all undistributed earnings will be transferred to the parent entity.This presumption may be overcome by the parent entity, and no income taxes would be accrued, if sufficient evidence shows that the subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely or that the earnings will be remitted in a tax-free liquidation.A parent entity shall have evidence of specific plans for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of a subsidiary which demonstrates that remittance of the earnings will be postponed indefinitely.These criteria requi
red to overcome the presumption are sometimes referred to as the indefinite reversal criteria.Accordingly, deferred income taxes were not recognized on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary, Ultimate Canada. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $916 million of net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income.As of that date, we did not have any net operating loss carryforwards for foreign income tax reporting purposes available to offset future taxable income. The $916 million was attributable to deductions from the exercise of non-qualified employee, and non-employee director, stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, the benefit of which will primarily be credited to paid-in capital and deferred tax asset when realized.The carryforwards expire from 2011 through 2030. Utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of cumulative ownership changes in Ultimates eq
uity instruments. 53 Table of Contents Effective January1, 2007, we adopted ASC 740 formerly FIN No48.ASC 740 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.As of December 31, 2010, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $19 million, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome of any particular uncertain tax position, management does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the estimates of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly i
n the next twelve months. Tax years 1996 to 2009 remain subject to future examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. We recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as components of our income tax provision.

As of December 31, 2010, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock authorized under the Plan and the Prior Plan was 12,500,000 and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that were available to be issued under all Awards granted under the Plan was 915,628 shares. Stock-Based Compensation The following table sets forth the SBC resulting from stock-based arrangements that is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated in thousands  For the Years Ended December 31  2010 2009 2008  Cost of recurring revenues 914 689 871 Cost of services revenues 1,238 1,316 1,988 Cost of license revenues 12 Sales and marketing 6,678 7,059 7,389 Research and development 1,218 1,228 1,570 General and administrative 3,201 2,942 3,626 Total SBC 13,249 13,234 15,456 Net cash proceeds from the exercise of Options were $149 million, $63 million, and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.There was a $67 million and a $05 million income tax benefit recognized in additional paid in capital from the realization of excess stock-based payment deductions during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.There was no income tax benefit realized from Option exercises during the year ended December 31, 2008.  54 Table of Contents Fair Value There were no Options granted during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.The fair value of Options granted for the year ended December 31, 2008 was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions   For the Year Ended December 31, 2008 Expected term in years 52 Volatility 41 Interest rate 278 Dividend yield Weighted average fair value at grant date 1117 Our computation of the expected term is based on the historical exercise experience under the stock-based plans of the underlying Award including post-vesting employment termination behavior and represents the period of time the stock-based Awards are expected to be outstanding.Our computation of the expected volatility for the year ended December 31, 2008 is based upon historical volatility and the expected term of the Option.The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life.We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.The weighted-average forfeiture rate of 52% for the year ended December 31, 200
8 was based on historical data. Options Options granted to officers and employees under the Plan and the Prior Plan generally have a 10-year term, vesting 25% immediately and 25% on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.Options granted to non-employee directors under the Plan and the Prior Plan generally have a 10-year term and vest and become exercisable immediately on the grant date.However, certain Options granted to non-employee directors for board services during the period January 3, 2005 through July 2, 2007 become exercisable on the earliest of i the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, ii the 90th day after the date on which the director ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors of Ultimate the Board or iii the effecti
ve date of a change in control of Ultimate. Prior to July24, 2007, non-employee directors received discounted Options under the Plan and the Prior Plan as compensation for their services.On that date, the Compensation Committee of the Board the Compensation Committee rescinded the previously approved fee schedule for service on the Board and Board Committees and replaced it with a program involving market price Options and restricted stock awards under the Plan.Under resolutions adopted by the Compensation Committee, commencing with the third fiscal quarter of 2007, ieach non-employee director was granted an Option to purchase 3,750 shares of Ultimates Common Stock for each regular quarterly meeting of the Board attended in 2007 and 2008, dated as of the date of such meeting, at an exercise price equal to the closi
ng price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date of such meeting, and ii each of the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Compensation Committee of the Board was granted an Option to purchase 2,500 shares of Ultimates Common Stock for each fiscal quarter in 2007 and 2008, dated as of the date of the regularly scheduled meeting of such Committee during such quarter, at an exercise price equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date of such meeting.These Option grants vested immediately upon grant. In addition to the Option grants discussed above, commencing with the third fiscal quarter of 2007, each non-employee director was granted a restricted stock award under the Plan for each fiscal quarter in 2007 and 2008, dated as of the date of the regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee during such quarter, of that number of shares of Ultimates Common Stock equal to the quotient of $12,500 divided by the closing price of our Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date of such meeting, rounded down to the nearest full number of shares.The restricted stock awards shall vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a directors death, disability, cessation of service at the end of his term or the occurrence of a change in control of Ultimate. On February 4, 2009, the Compensation Committee amended the previously approved arrangement pursuant to which the non-employee directors and the Chairmen of the Audit Committee of the Board the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee of the Board, respectively, were granted Options for each regular Board and Committee meeting attended.Under the arrangement as amended, i each non-employee director was granted a restricted stock award of 1,000 shares of Common Stock for each regular meeting of the Board attended in 2009 and during the first three quarters of 2010 and ii each of the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee was granted a restricted stock award of 625 shares of Common Stock for attendance at ea
ch regular meeting of the respectiveCommittee in 2009 and during the first three quarters of 2010 that he chaired.In addition, in 2009 and in 2010, each non-employee director was granted, for each fiscal quarter during which he served, a restricted stock award of that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of $12,500 divided by the closing price of the Common Stock on NASDAQ on the date of grant, which is the effective date of the grant determined by the Board for each such quarter, rounded down to the closest full number of shares.The date of grant shall not be a date prior to the date of the Boards determination of the same.Such restricted stock awards shall vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to accelerated vesting in the event of a directors death, disability, cessation of service or the end of his term or the occurrence of a change of control of Ultimate.  55 Table of Contents On October 25, 2010, the Board amended the previously approved arrangement pursuant to which the non-employee directors and Chairmen of the Audit and Compensation Committees of the Board, respectively, were granted Awards for each regular Board and Committee meeting attended.Under the arrangement, as amended, i each non-employee director was granted a restricted stock award of 750 shares of Common Stock for each regular meeting of the Board attended in the fourth quarter of 2010 and ii each of the Chairmen of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee was granted a restricted stock award of 468 shares of Common Stock for attendance at each regular meeting of the Committee during the fourth quarter of 2010 that he chaired. Restricted Stock Awards Under the provisions of the Plan, Ultimate may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Board, grant restricted stock awards Restricted Stock Awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors.The shares of Common Stock issued under Restricted Stock Awards are subject to certain vesting requirements and restrictions on transfer.During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, we granted Restricted Stock Awards for 134,750, 175,000 and 439,991 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to officers and employees and we granted Restricted Stock Awards for 30,816, 37,235 and 10,285 shares, respectively, of Common Stock to non-employee directors.Compensation expense for Restricted Stock Awards is measured based on the closing market price of our Common Stock at the da
te of grant and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Holders of Restricted Stock Awards have all rights of a stockholder including the right to vote the shares and receive all dividends and other distributions paid or made with respect thereto.Each Restricted Stock Award becomes vested on the fourth anniversary of the respective date of grant, subject to the grantees continued employment with Ultimate or any of its subsidiaries on each such vesting date and subject further to accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control ofUltimate, death or disability, the termination of employment by Ultimate without cause or, in the case of a non-employee director, at cessation of his board services at the end of his term.Included in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $80 million, $79 million, and $65 million, respectively, of compensation expense for Restricted Sto
ck Awards. Restricted Stock Unit Awards Ultimate may, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, make Awards of stock units or restricted stock units under the Plan Restricted Stock Unit Awards to certain officers and employees.A Restricted Stock Unit Award is a grant of a number of hypothetical share units with respect to shares of Common Stock that are subject to vesting and transfer restrictions and conditions under a restricted stock unit award agreement.The value of each unit is equal to the fair value of one share of Common Stock on any applicable date of determination.The payment with respect to each unit under a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be made, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, i in a number of shares of our Common Stock equal to the number 
of Restricted Stock Units becoming vested, ii in cash, in an amount equal to the fair market value of a share of our Common Stock on the vesting date multiplied by the number of restricted stock units becoming vested on such date or iii in a combination of both.The grantee of a Restricted Stock Unit Award does not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to the shares subject to a Restricted Stock Unit Award until such time as shares of Common Stock are delivered to the grantee pursuant to the terms of the related stock unit award agreement. Beginning in 2009, we commenced granting Restricted Stock Unit Awards to employees and discontinued the grant of Options under the Plan.Such Restricted Stock Unit Awards vest in three equal annual installments of 33-1/3% of the number of Restricted Stock Unit Awards on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant thereof, subject to the participants continued employment with Ultimate or any of its subsidiaries on each such vesting date, and shall be payable as described above, provided, however, that if any such anniversary is not a date on which our Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ, then the vesting date shall be the last such trading day immediately preceding such anniversary; and provided further, however, that if the Chief Financial Officer CFO of Ultimate should determine that any suc
h anniversary falls within a period during which the participant is prohibited from trading Ultimates Common Stock under our stock trading policy, the CFO shall so advise the participant in writing and the vesting date shall be the date as of which the CFO has determined that such period has ended. There were 199,525 and 211,635 Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted to employees during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. There were no Restricted Stock Unit Awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2008.Non-cash stock-based compensation expense for Restricted Stock Unit Awards is measured based on the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant and recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.Included in Ultimates consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $24 million, $09 million and $77 thousand, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense from Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  56 Table of Contents Option, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Unit Activity The following table summarizes Option activity for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010, as follows in thousands, except per share amounts  Weighted  Average  Weighted Remaining Aggregate  Average Contractual Intrinsic Options Shares Exercise Price Term in Years Value Outstanding at December 31, 2007 4,547 1331 Granted 1,066 2833 Exercised 576 897 Forfeited or expired 73 2654 Outstanding at December 31, 2008 4,964 1686 602 16,140  Exercisable at December 31, 2008 3,792 1373 517 16,140  Outstanding at December 31, 2008 4,964 1686 Granted Exercised 668 940 Forfeited or expired 131 2494 Outstanding at December 31, 2009 4,165 1779 555 49,687  Exercisable at December 31, 2009 3,576 1612 515 48,360  Outstanding at December 31, 2009 4,165 1779 Granted Exercised 1,124 1325 Forfeited or expired 26 2758 Outstanding at December 31, 2010 3,015 1940 507 88,136  Exercisable at December 31, 2010 2,807 1871 490 83,989 The aggregate intrinsic value of Options in the table above represents total pretax intrinsic value i.e., the difference between the closing price of our Common Stock on the last trading day of the reporting period and the exercise price, times the number of shares that would have been received by the Option holders had all Option holders exercised their Options on December 31, 2010.The amount of the aggregate intrinsic value changes, based on the fair value of our Common Stock.Total intrinsic value of Options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $251 million, $101 million and $130 million, respectively.Total fair value of Options vested during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $42 million, $57 million and $76 million, respectively.

PART II Item 5.Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Ultimate carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Ultimates management, including the Chief Executive Officer the CEO and the Chief Financial Officer the CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Ultimates disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K pursuant to Rules 13a-15e or 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, Ultimates management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, Ultimates disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in Ultimates Exchange Act reports is recorded, processe
d, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Ultimates disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the achievement of these objectives.It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and thus has inherent limitations.Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance as to the achievement of their objectives. Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act.Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
0;Based on the results of this assessment, our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.However, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on Ultimates internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, which is included on page 62 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes during the fourth quarter of 2010 in Ultimates internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Ultimates internal control over financial reporting.  61 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. We have audited The Ultimate Software Group, Inc.s theCompanys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with author
izations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board UnitedStates, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2010, and our report dated March1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP
