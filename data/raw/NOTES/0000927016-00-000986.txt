23            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Renaissance Worldwide, Inc.
In our opinion, based upon our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8
of this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Renaissance Worldwide, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company
at December 26, 1998 and December 25, 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year ended June 28, 1997, for the six
months ended December 27, 1997, and for each of the two years in the period
ended December 25, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. In addition, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedule listed in the index appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits. We did not audit the results of operations of Neoglyphics
Media Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the year ended December 31,
1997, which are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended June 28, 1997. We also did not audit the results
of operations of Triad Data, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the year
ended December 31, 1997, which are included in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 1997. In the aggregate,
these statements reflect total revenues of $61,575,000 in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 1997. Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose reports thereon have been
furnished to us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to
the amounts included for Neoglyphics Media Corporation and Triad Data, Inc.
for this period is based solely on the reports of the other auditors. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS
Renaissance Worldwide, Inc. Renaissance or the Company is a global
provider of business and technology consulting services to organizations with
complex information technology IT operations in a broad range of
industries. The Company offerings are categorized into three business units:
the Enterprise Solutions Group, Government Solutions Group, and Information
Technology Consulting Services Group ITCS Group. The Enterprise Solutions
Group provides IT solutions design and implementation services. The Government
Solutions Group provides specialized management and technology consulting
services to the public sector. The ITCS Group provides consulting services
centered around application design, implementation and support. A fourth
segment, the Business Strategy Group, which provided management consulting and
technology integration services in connection with performance support
systems, was sold for $650 million on March 10, 2000, and is reported as
discontinued operations see Note 17. The Company primary locations are in
North America with subsidiaries in Europe and Asia/Pacific see Note 12.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Renaissance
Worldwide, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Fiscal Year
Effective with the period ended December 27, 1997, the Company changed its
fiscal year from the last Saturday in June to the last Saturday in December.
The six month period ended December 27, 1997 the Transition Period
reflects the results of operations and cash flows for the six months then
ended for the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The results of operations
and of cash flows for the years ended June 28, 1997, December 26, 1998 and
December 25, 1999 are for 52 weeks.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company cash equivalents consist primarily of short term federal notes and
money market securities bearing interest at a rate of approximately 40% at
December 25, 1999. The investments are carried at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates market value. The Company considers such securities to be
classified as available-for-sale under Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue is primarily comprised of fees for consulting
services. The majority of the Company revenue is from contracts on a time
and materials basis and is recognized as the services are performed. The
remainder of the Company contracts are on a fixed-price basis, and revenue
from those contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method
based upon the number of labor hours incurred compared to the total estimated
hours at estimated realizable rates. Under the percentage of completion
method, the Company must estimate the percentage of completion of each project
at the end of each financial reporting period. Estimates are subject to
adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in projected completion
costs or dates. Revenues are reported net of reimbursable expenses which are
typically billed and collected from clients. Losses, if any, are provided for
in the period in which the loss is determined. Amounts received in excess of
revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue.
33              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Accounts Receivable, Concentration of Credit Risk and Uncertainties
The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables. Credit risk
with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by the diversification of the
Company operations, as well as its large client base and its geographical
dispersion. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its receivables and
may obtain retainers at the onset of significant fixed price client
engagements. Collateral is not required for time and material contracts. In
management opinion, the Company has provided sufficient provisions to
prevent a significant impact of credit losses to the financial statements. The
failure of the Company to complete a fixed price project to the client
satisfaction within the fixed price exposes the Company to potentially
unrecoverable cost overruns.
Fees on fixed-price contracts are generally billable to clients upon the
achievement of specified milestones. Unbilled revenue was $231 million and
$149 million at December 26, 1998, and December 25, 1999, respectively.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or more than 10%
of accounts receivable for any period presented.
Fixed Assets
Fixed assets are stated at cost. Additions, renewals and betterments of
fixed assets are capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures for minor
items are generally expensed as incurred. Depreciation of fixed assets is
provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives                       
Buildings and  315 years
Computer  5 years
Furniture and  5 to 7 years
Motor  5 years
Leasehold  Lesser of lease term or 20 years  In March 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 was effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. The Company existing
accounting policies conform to the requirements of this statement. The Company
has capitalized $36 million and $41 million in 1998 and 1999 respectively in
relation to its PeopleSoft implementation. These costs primarily include
licensing fees and internal labor costs of employees directly associated with
the implementation project.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are recorded as expense when incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes, as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, utilizing currently enacted tax rates. The
effect of any future change in tax rates is recognized in the period in which
the change occurs.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries had previously elected to be treated
as small business corporations for income tax purposes with income or loss and
credits passed through to the stockholders. These elections were
34              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
subsequently terminated prior to or upon acquisition by the Company and the
net deferred tax asset or liability as of the date of acquisition has been
included in the provision for income taxes in the period of termination.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries had previously utilized the cash
method of accounting for income taxes. Upon acquisition by the Company, these
subsidiaries converted to the accrual method of accounting for income taxes.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for employee awards under its stock plans in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees and related interpretations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation for disclosure purposes only.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies at December 26, 1998 and December 25, 1999, and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses for the year ended June 28, 1997,
the six month period ended December 27, 1997 and the years ended December 26,
1998 and December 25, 1999. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company amortizes goodwill and intangible assets arising from purchase
acquisitions on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 to 30 years.
Goodwill is evaluated for consideration of potential impairment based on the
operating results and forecasted cash flows of the acquired entity. Based on
these evaluations, the Company has written off goodwill of $40 million
associated with Renaissance Worldwide Professionals, Ltd. formerly James
Duncan Associates, based in the United Kingdom in 1999. The Company also
wrote off goodwill of $214 million associated with COBA Consulting Limited
COBA UK and $57 million associated with of Renaissance Technomic, Inc.
and Renaissance Technomic Limited collectively, Technomic, businesses in
1998 which were part of the Business Strategy Group and are reported in
discontinued operations See Note 17.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Other Comprehensive Income
The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income which
requires disclosure of comprehensive income and its components in interim and
annual reports. Comprehensive income includes all changes in stockholders'
equity during a period except those resulting from investments by stockholders
and distributions to stockholders. Accordingly, the components of
comprehensive income include net income, cumulative translation adjustments
and unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities. Deferred
taxes have not been provided on cumulative translation adjustments because
deferred taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings see Note 8.
Deferred taxes and any reclassification adjustments related to unrealized
gains/losses on investments are insignificant.                    35              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Translation of Foreign Currencies
The functional currency of the Company subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date; income and
expense items and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the
period. Cumulative net translation adjustments are included in stockholders'
equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, not
significant in amount, are included in the results of operations as other
income expense.
Earnings Loss Per Share
Earnings loss per share--basic is calculated based upon the weighted
average number of common shares actually outstanding, and earnings loss per
share--diluted is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common
shares and dilutive potential common stock outstanding. Potential common stock
includes stock options and warrants, calculated using the treasury stock
method, and the assumed conversion of preferred stock see Note 9. However,
potential common stock has been excluded from the calculation of diluted
earnings per share for the year ended December 25, 1999, as its effect would
be anti-dilutive.
A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
is as follows                               Year Ended

Recent Accounting Developments
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC released
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, which provides guidance on the
recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements
filed with the SEC. The Company is required to be in conformity with the
provisions of SAB 101 in fiscal 2000 and is currently evaluating the impact
SAB 101 will have on its financial condition or results of operations.
3. POOLING OF INTERESTS ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 1998 Pooling of Interests
In fiscal 1998, the Company acquired Neoglyphics Media Corporation
Neoglyphics and Triad Data, Inc. Triad for a total of 4,554,760 shares
of the Company common stock. Neoglyphics was an Internet development and
applications services provider which was added to the Company Enterprise
Solutions Group. In addition, outstanding stock options to purchase
Neoglyphics common stock were converted into options to purchase 119,940
shares of the Company common stock. Triad was an information technology
consulting firm which became part of the Company Services Group. The Company
incurred $69 million in acquisition-related expenses in the second quarter of
1998 related to these transactions.
36              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Neoglyphics and Triad each had a calendar year end and the results of
operations for the year ended December 31, 1997 were combined with the results
of operations for the Company fiscal year ended June 28, 1997. Additionally,
the financial position of Neoglyphics and Triad as of December 31, 1996 has
been combined with the Company financial position as of June 28, 1997. In
order to conform Neoglyphics' and Triad year end to the Company fiscal
year end, the consolidated statement of income for the six months ended
December 27, 1997 includes six months July to December 1997 for Neoglyphics
and Triad which has also been included in the consolidated statement of income
for the fiscal year ended June 28, 1997. An adjustment has been made to
retained earnings in the transition period ended December 28, 1997 to
eliminate the duplication of net income of Neoglyphics and Triad for such six
month period.
Transition Period Pooling of Interests
In 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Renaissance
Solutions, Inc. RSI and the Hunter Group Inc. Hunter Group. In total,
21,647,012 shares of the Company common stock were exchanged for all of the
outstanding common stock of RSI and the Hunter Group. In addition, outstanding
stock options to purchase RSI and the Hunter Group common stock were converted
into options to purchase 3,361,088 shares of the Company common stock.
Fiscal 1997 Pooling of Interests
In 1996, the Company acquired Applications Resources, Inc. ARI, Shamrock
Computer Resources, Ltd. SCR and International Systems Services
Corporation ISS for a total of 6,797,548 shares of the Company common
stock. ARI and SCR are information technology consulting firms performing
services similar to those of the ITCS Group. ISS is a consulting firm
providing business and management consulting services. In addition,
outstanding stock options to purchase ARI common stock were converted into
options to purchase 435,810 shares of the Company common stock.
These transactions have been accounted for as pooling of interests and,
therefore, the financial statements of the Company have been restated to
include the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of these
two companies for all periods presented.
There were no material transactions between the Company, ARI, SCR, ISS, RSI,
the Hunter Group, Neoglyphics or Triad during any of the periods presented. No
material adjustments to net assets or results of operations were necessary to
conform the accounting practices of ARI, SCR, ISS, RSI, the Hunter Group,
Neoglyphics or Triad to that of the Company. Certain reclassifications were
made to the financial statements of ARI, SCR, ISS, RSI, the Hunter Group,
Neoglyphics and Triad to conform with the Company classifications. All costs
associated with the acquisitions have been expensed as incurred.
4. PURCHASES AND DISPOSITIONS

of the purchaser common stock. The note is convertible into common stock at
the time of a qualifying initial public offering by the purchaser at a 20%
discount from the offering price. The purchaser filed a preliminary
registration statement with the SEC in early 2000. In connection with this
sale, the Company recognized an after tax gain of $833,000. The gain on the
sale has been classified as an extraordinary item because the pooling of
interests method of accounting was applied to the original acquisition of
these assets within the last two years.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company made a decision to sell
its Business Strategy Group for $650 million in cash. Accordingly, the
results of operations of the Business Strategy Group have been classified as
discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements see Note
17. The transaction closed on March 10, 2000 and will result in a gain for
the Company of approximately $10 million which will be recorded in the first
quarter of fiscal 2000. In February 2000, the Company signed a letter of
intent to sell Renaissance Worldwide Professionals Ltd., formerly known as
James Duncan Associates, back to its management for approximately $12
million. This transaction is expected to close by the end of March 2000 and
will not have a material effect upon the Company results of operations. The
Company recorded a goodwill writedown of $40 million in connection with this
business in the fourth quarter of 1999 see Note 6.
Fiscal 1998 Purchases
In fiscal 1998, the Company acquired Exad Galons, Hackenberg and Partners
Hackenberg and International Public Access Technologies IPAT for an
aggregate of $125 million in cash. Exad Galons and Hackenberg were added to
the Company Enterprise Solutions Group whereas IPAT became part of the
Company Government Solutions Group.
In connection with these acquisitions, the Company may pay or has paid
contingent consideration of $83 million based upon certain earnout
arrangements. Such amounts are recorded as additional purchase price when
paid.
Transition Period Purchases
During the transition period ended December 27, 1997, the Company acquired
four companies: McClain Group, Inc., Technomics Consultants International,
Inc., Eligibility Management Systems, Inc., and Cambridge Software Group. The
aggregate purchase price and related costs associated with these acquisitions
was $375 million which has been allocated to the assets and liabilities
assumed based upon their fair value on the date of acquisition. The excess of
the purchase price over this fair value of acquired assets and liabilities has
been allocated to goodwill.
In connection with the Transition Period Acquisitions, the Company may pay
or has paid contingent consideration of up to $126 million based upon certain
earnout arrangements. Such amounts are recorded as additional purchase price
when paid.
38              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Fiscal 1997 Purchases
During the fiscal year ended June 28, 1997, the Company acquired five
companies: Morris Information Systems, Sun-Tek Consultants, Inc., Sterling
Information Group, James Duncan & Associates JDA, and Connexus Consulting
Group, Inc. In addition, during fiscal 1997, prior to the merger with the
Company, RSI acquired two companies: COBA Consulting Limited COBA UK and
C.M. Management Systems Ltd., Inc. COBA-Boston. These acquisitions are
collectively referred to as the Fiscal 1997 Acquisitions. The aggregate
purchase price and related costs associated with the Fiscal 1997 Acquisitions
were $380 million plus 266,528 shares of the Company common stock.
In connection with the Fiscal 1997 Acquisitions, the Company was required to
pay contingent consideration of up to $323 million based on certain earn-out
arrangements. Such amounts, when paid, were recorded as additional purchase
price. As of December 25, 1999, the Company had accrued contingent
consideration of approximately $41 million associated with COBA-Boston which
was paid in the first quarter of 2000.
These transactions were accounted for as purchases. The purchase price has
been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
fair values as of the respective dates of acquisition. The excess of the
consideration paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has
been recorded as goodwill and amortized. The results of operations for these
acquisitions have been included in the Company results of operations from
their respective dates of acquisition. At December 26, 1998 and December 25,
1999, $71 million and $90 million, respectively, were accrued for contingent
consideration related to the above acquisitions. These amounts are included in
other accrued expenses.
Assuming the 1999, 1998, Transition Period, and 1997 Acquisitions occurred
at the beginning of each respective period, the pro forma results of
operations would not materially differ from the Company reported results of
operations.
5. RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES
Notes receivable from stockholders of $1,476,000 and $722,000 at December
26, 1998 and at December 25, 1999, respectively, which are included as a

Hunter Group totaling $250,000, which accrue interest at 5%, and notes issued
to various employees to purchase the Company common stock totaling $246,000
which accrue interest at 70%. In addition, the Company has notes receivable
and advances from officers totaling approximately $20 million due from
various senior officers of the Company of which approximately $10 million is
included in other assets and approximately $10 million is included in other
current assets. Notes bear interest at the prime rate.
6. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ASSET WRITE-DOWNS
In February 2000, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell Renaissance
Worldwide Professionals, Ltd. formerly James Duncan & Associates back to its
management for approximately $12 million. In connection with this transaction
which is expected to close in March 2000, the Company recorded a charge in the
fourth quarter of 1999 to write-down goodwill in the amount of $40 million.
In the second quarter of 1999, the Company recorded an asset writedown of
$29 million in connection with the sale of Neoglyphics and CMS Note 4.
39              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In 1998, the Company recorded a charge of $57 million related to a
restructuring plan designed to focus the Company on the new corporate strategy
and eliminate redundant facilities, equipment, software, and personnel
recorded in the third quarter of 1998. A balance of $29 million accrual
remained from this charge at December 26, 1998 which included $17 million of
costs to terminate lease obligations and other activities and $12 million
related to severance and other costs. These charges were utilized as planned
in 1999.
7. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
During 1998, the Company had a line of credit facility which provided a
borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable as defined, up to a
maximum borrowing of $85 million, payable on demand. Interest was payable
monthly in arrears at the bank prime rate plus 050% 825% at December 26,
1998 or the LIBOR rate plus 250% 771% at December 26, 1998, at the option
of the Company. The line of credit was collateralized by the majority of the
assets of the Company, excluding the assets of the Wells Avenue Realty Trust
Note 14, contained certain restrictions, and required the maintenance of
certain financial covenants. This line of credit was terminated on March 24,
1999.
In February of 1999, the Company entered into a new line of credit Interim
Facility with a different bank to provide a borrowing base of 85% of
eligible accounts receivable as defined, up to a maximum borrowing of $110
million. Interest was payable monthly in arrears at the LIBOR rate plus 200%
or the higher of the bank prime rate or the Fed Funds rate plus 050%, plus
075%, at the Company option. The Interim Facility was collateralized by the
majority of the assets of the Company, contained certain restrictions, and
required maintenance of certain financial covenants. The Interim Facility was
a short-term facility to be used until syndication of a senior term loan
facility committed to by the bank. The Interim Facility was used to repay the
outstanding borrowings on the existing line of credit that was terminated on
March 24, 1999.
On July 15, 1999 the Company entered into a three-year, $150 million
revolving credit and term loan agreement the Credit Facility with a bank
syndicate. The Credit Facility consists of a revolving line of credit of $100
million Revolving Credit Facility and a term loan of $50 million Term
Loan. The Credit Facility bears interest at the higher of the Federal Funds
Rate plus 050% or the prime rate, plus up to 175% or LIBOR plus up to 30 depending on the Company level of compliance with certain financial ratios.
The Credit Facility requires the Company to pay a commitment fee of 0375% to
050% per annum, depending on certain financial criteria, on the unused
portion of the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility requires the Company to
make quarterly principal payments of $250,000 on the Term Loan beginning
September 15, 2000 and each quarter thereafter until June 15, 2002. The
remaining obligations under the Term Loan would be repaid on July 15, 2002
along with any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The
Credit Facility is collateralized by the majority of the assets of the Company
and contains certain restrictions and various covenants, including the
maintenance of defined financial ratios.
On September 15, 1999, the Company announced that it was revising its
revenue and earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters of 1999 due
to a softening in the demand for services in two of its core businesses Enterprise Solutions and ITCS. Based upon this revised outlook, the Company
informed the bank syndicate that it would not be in compliance with certain of
its financial covenants for the third quarter of 1999. On November 4, 1999,
the Company and the banks signed an amendment to the Credit Facility amending
certain financial covenants for the third quarter of 1999 through the third
quarter of 2000, reverting back to the original financial covenants
established in the Credit Facility thereafter. The Credit Facility, as
amended, now bears interest at the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 050%
or the prime rate, plus up to 225% or LIBOR plus up to 35%, depending on the
Company level of compliance with certain financial ratios. In connection
with this amendment, the Company was required to pay amendment fees to the
banks and related expenses of approximately $500,000 which were recorded in
the third quarter of 1999 as interest and other expense, net.
40              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  As of December 25, 1999, the total amount outstanding under the Credit
Facility, including the Term Loan, was $680 million at a weighted average
interest rate of 997% with a remaining borrowing availability under the
Credit Facility approximately $196 million. The Company had additional
outstanding debt, including current portions, of approximately $55 million
which was comprised of other local lines of credit and various notes payable
with interest rates ranging from 675% to 9375% and maturities between May
2000 and April 2013.
On February 25, 2000, the Company and the banks signed a second amendment to
the Credit Facility which permitted the Company to complete its sale of the
Business Strategy Group see Note 17 and Renaissance Worldwide Professionals
Ltd., formerly James Duncan Associates, and amended certain financial
covenants to reflect the sale of these businesses.
On March 14, 2000 the Company used $600 million of the proceeds that it
received from the sale of its Business Strategy Group to repay the $500
million Term Loan and $100 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit
Facility see Note 17.
8. INCOME TAXES
Prior to November 27, 1996, January 1, 1997, December 31, 1996 and April 2,
1998, SCR, Neoglyphics, ISS and Triad, respectively, had each elected to be an
S Corporation for federal income tax purposes as provided in Section 1362a
of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the corporate income or loss and
credits were passed through to the stockholders and reported on their personal
tax returns.
Neoglyphics elected to terminate its S Corporation status on January 1,
1997. At the time of this conversion, a net deferred tax liability of $302,000
was recorded through the income tax provision on January 1, 1997. This
deferred tax liability was comprised principally of the effects of Neoglyphics
being a cash basis tax payer.
SCR, ISS and Triad elections to be treated as S Corporations
terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of all of the common stock of
SCR, ISS and Triad by the Company. As a result, the income or loss of SCR
commencing on November 27, 1996, the income or loss of ISS commencing on
December 31, 1996 and the income or loss of Triad commencing on April 2, 1998
is subject to corporate income tax, and is included in the income tax
provision benefit described below.
At the time of the conversion of SCR from an S Corporation to a C
Corporation, a net deferred tax asset of $403,000 was recorded through the
income tax provision on November 27, 1996. This deferred tax asset was
comprised principally of certain accrued expenses and allowances which are
recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting.
At the time of conversion of ISS from an S Corporation to a C Corporation, a
net deferred tax liability of $1,002,000 was recorded through the income tax
provision on December 31, 1996. This deferred tax liability was comprised
principally of the effect of converting from the cash basis to the accrual
basis for tax reporting purposes.
At the time of conversion of Triad from an S Corporation to a C Corporation,
a net deferred tax liability of $2,878,000 was recorded through the income tax
provision on April 2, 1998. This deferred tax liability was comprised
principally of the effect of converting from the cash basis to the accrual
basis for tax reporting purposes.
41              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  From its inception, the Hunter Group reported its financial results for
income tax purposes using the cash method of accounting. Upon acquisition by
the Company, the Hunter Group changed its method of accounting for income tax
reporting purposes from the cash method to the accrual method. As a result,
substantially all of the deferred tax liability related to the Hunter Group
accumulated on the balance sheet will become due and payable over a four-year
period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Deferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences
between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Under SFAS 109, the
benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and operating
loss or credit carryforwards is recognized if it is more likely than not that
a benefit will be realized. Deferred tax expense benefit represents the
change in the net deferred tax asset or liability balance. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are comprised of the following at December 26, 1998, and

offset future federal and state taxable income, respectively. The
carryforwards expire on various dates from 2009 to 2018. An ownership change,
as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of net operating
loss that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Non-deductible expenses during the year ended June 28, 1997 and six months
ended December 27, 1997 and the year ended December 26, 1998 primarily relate
to certain costs incurred in connection with the acquisitions of SCR, ISS,
RSI, the Hunter Group, Neoglyphics and Triad.
Undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregated
approximately $30 million on December 25, 1999, which under existing law,
will not be subject to U.S. tax until distributed as dividends. Since the
earnings have been or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations, no provision has been made for any U.S. taxes that may be
applicable thereto. Furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign governments on
those earnings may be used in whole or in part as credits against the U.S. tax
on any dividends distributed from such earnings. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these undistributed
earnings.
9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock, $010 par value
On April 10, 1996, Renaissance then sole stockholder authorized 1,000,000
shares of preferred stock, $010 par value. Preferred stock may be issued in
one or more series at the discretion of the Board of Directors of Renaissance
without shareholder approval with such designations, rights and preferences
as the Board of Directors may determine. The preferred stock may have
dividend, liquidation, redemption, conversion, voting or other rights which
may be more expansive than the rights of the holders of Renaissance common
stock.
Preferred Stock, no par value
Renaissance wholly-owned subsidiary, ARI, was authorized to issue
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 3,000,000 shares were designated
as Series A Preferred Stock the Series A Preferred Stock. The remaining
preferred stock may have been issued from time to time in one or more
additional series at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Shares of
Series A Preferred Stock were non-redeemable and had a liquidation preference
of $079 per share plus any declared but unpaid dividends.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock was convertible into the number of
shares of common stock that results from dividing the conversion price in
effect at the time of conversion into $079 for each share of Series A
Preferred Stock being converted. The conversion price of the Series A
Preferred Stock was initially $1084 per share, subject to adjustment for
stock splits, dividends, distributions, and combinations. At June 29, 1996,
all shares of Series A Preferred Stock were convertible into 548856 shares of
Renaissance common stock based on a conversion price of $01084 per share.
On November 26, 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of ARI by
Renaissance see Note 3, all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
Stock were converted into 1,434,160 shares of common stock.
Stock Split and Authorized Shares
On July 30, 1997, Renaissance stockholders approved an increase to
99,000,000 in the number of authorized shares of common stock of the Company.
On February 12, 1998, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split. All shares
and per share amounts included in the consolidated financial statements have
been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock split for all periods
presented.
44              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Sale of Common and Preferred Stock
On November 19, 1996, ARI sold 55,000 units to an unrelated investor for net
proceeds of $26 million. Each unit consisted of shares of ARI series A

shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 60,374 shares of common stock.
Public Offerings of Common Stock
On February 26, 1997, Renaissance completed a secondary public offering for
the sale of 2,468,332 shares of common stock, including the reissuance of the
treasury shares acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of SCR see Note
3. Renaissance received approximately $483 million from the sale of the
shares, net of the underwriting discounts and expenses associated with the
offering. The excess of the cost of the treasury stock over the net reissuance
price has been charged to retained earnings. Net proceeds were used to repay
all outstanding indebtedness under Renaissance credit facility.
On November 18, 1996, RSI completed an additional offering. The transaction
included 344,240 shares sold by RSI and 1,679,760 shares sold by existing

Gemini Warrants
RSI sold two warrants together, the Gemini Warrants to Gemini upon the
closing of RSI initial public offering for an aggregate purchase price of
$16 million. One warrant was exercisable through April 11, 1998 for up to

10. STOCK PLANS
Employee Stock Option Plans
1996 Stock Plan
This plan, adopted in March 1996, authorizes the grant of incentive stock
options, non-qualified stock options, stock purchase authorizations or stock
bonus awards to key employees, including officers, employee directors and
consultants.
As of December 27, 1997, the total number of shares of Common Stock
authorized under the 1996 Stock Plan was 7,200,000. In May of 1998, the
shareholders approved an amendment to the 1996 Stock Plan, increasing the
original number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Plan.
The amendment
45              RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
provided that for a three-year period, the shares available under the Plan
will be increased each year by a number of shares equal to 4% of the total
outstanding shares at the beginning of each year. For 1998 and 1999, that
increase was 2,233,885 and 2,241,038 respectively.
Incentive stock options cannot be granted to consultants. For incentive
options, the purchase price is equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant 110% of fair market value for stockholders who hold greater than 10% of
the Company stock at the time of grant. For non-qualified options and stock
purchase authorizations, the purchase price is determined by the Board of
Directors within limits as set forth in the plan, but shall not be less than
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant. The periods
over which options are exercisable are determined by the Board of Directors.
These options generally vest over one to five years and may expire up to ten
years after the date of grant five years for incentive options granted to 10%
stockholders. If permitted by the Board of Directors, employees may use
previously acquired shares of the Company common stock provided that such
shares tendered have been held for at least six months or may borrow money
from the Company on a recourse basis for a period of time not to exceed five
years to pay the exercise price of shares purchased. The Board of Directors
has the discretion to designate non-qualified options as transferable. The
plan will terminate in March 2006.
1998 Acquisition Plan
In April 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Acquisition Plan for
use exclusively for non-qualified options to be awarded to employees of
acquired businesses. This plan has the same term and vesting provisions of the
1996 Stock Plan. A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized
for issuance under the Plan.
1998 International Plan
In April 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 International Plan
for use exclusively for non-qualified options to be awarded to employees in
foreign jurisdictions. This plan has the same term and vesting provisions of
the 1996 Stock Plan. A total of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock were
authorized for issuance under the Plan.
1998 Directors Stock Plan
In May of 1998, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1998 Directors
Stock Option Plan the 1998 Directors Plan which replaced the existing 1996
Eligible Directors' Stock Plan. Under the 1998 Directors Plan, outside
directors of the Company will receive equity compensation in three ways. Upon
joining the Board, an outside director will receive an option covering 20,000
shares of Common Stock. This option will become exercisable in four annual
installments beginning one year after grant. Outside directors will also
receive an option covering 2,500 shares of common stock after each year of
service. This award, which represents compensation for service during the
previous year, will be immediately exercisable. Each director will be required
to take one-half on the annual retainer currently $12,000 in options having
an equivalent value and may elect to take all or a portion of the balance in
options as well. Options are granted at fair market value on the date of grant
and expire ten years from the date of grant. A total of 120,000 shares of
Common Stock were authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Other Stock Option Plans
As of December 25, 1999, 147,206 options were outstanding under the 1996
Eligible Director Stock Plan and the RSI Director Plan which the Company
assumed when it acquired RSI in 1997. The Company also assumed other stock
option plans from RSI, the Hunter Group and Neoglyphics. The Neoglyphics Stock
Option Plan was closed and all outstanding options were canceled in May of
1999, when the assets of this business

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
were sold see Note 4. As of December 25, 1999, 827,980 options were
outstanding under these RSI and the Hunter Group plans. These options
generally vest over one to five years and expire 10 years from the date of
grant.
Option Repricing
In December 1998, the Company offered employees the opportunity to reprice
their stock options at the fair market value of the Company common stock on
December 15, 1998. Employees electing to take advantage of this repricing
program agreed to a two for one exchange of their options and to a one year
holding period. In connection with this program, the Company repriced
6,159,730 of existing options with a weighted average exercise price of
$2155.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
This plan permits eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares
on a semi-annual basis. The purchase price is 85% of the lower of the fair
market value at the beginning or end of each six month period. Under this
plan, the Company issued 259,514 and 378,807 shares of common stock during
fiscal years 1998 and 1999 at an average price per share of $1878 and $518,
respectively. At December 25, 1999, the Company has 360,406 shares of common
stock available for issuance pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan.
Accounting Treatment
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Compensation is
recognized for the difference between the exercise price of options granted
and the estimated fair value of the related shares on the date of grant, and
is recorded over the vesting period. Amortization of compensation expense was
$494,000 for the fiscal year ended June 28, 1997, $750,000 for the six month
period ended December 27, 1997 and $0 for the fiscal years ended December 26,
1998 and December 25, 1999. The benefit of tax deductions associated with the
exercise of non-qualified stock options in excess of the amount of
compensation recorded for financial reporting purposes is recorded as a credit
to additional paid-in capital.
In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123. SFAS No. 123 is effective for periods beginning
after December 15, 1995. SFAS No. 123 requires that companies either recognize
compensation expense for grants of stock options and other equity instruments
based on fair value, or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and
earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements. The Company
adopted the disclosure provisions only of SFAS No. 123. Had compensation cost
of the Company stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates as calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 123,
the Company net income and earnings per share for the year ended June 28,
1997, the six months ended December 27, 1997 and the years ended December 26,
1998 and December 25, 1999 would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts

reflects grants made in the last three fiscal periods, the effects of applying
SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not likely to be representative
of the effects on reported net income for future years.

several mutual funds selected by the employee. The Company may make
contributions to the plans at its discretion; such contributions totaled
$605,000, $472,000, $30 million and $32 million for the year ended June 28,
1997, the six months ended December 27, 1997 and the years ended December 26,

with an entity controlled by the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the
Board and significant stockholder of the Company to utilize an airplane for
corporate travel purposes. The Company pays for such usage on a per-flight

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 14. CONSOLIDATION OF REAL ESTATE TRUST
As described in Note 15, the Company leases office space from the Wells
Avenue Realty Trust Trust, of which the Chief Executive Officer, Chairman
of the Board, and significant stockholder of the Company is the sole
beneficiary. Effective September 19, 1995, the Company renegotiated its lease
with the Trust in conjunction with a refinancing of the Trust mortgage. The
modified lease terms expanded the amount of space which the Company occupies,
committed the Company to rent the facility through the maturity date of the
mortgage loan, and granted the Company a right of first refusal to lease any
space in the facility currently occupied by other tenants when the tenants'
leases expire.
Accordingly, as of this date, the Company obtained significant control over
the operations of the Trust and assumed a significant portion of the Trust
obligations. As a result, the Company has consolidated the accounts of the
Trust as of September 19, 1995 on a prospective basis. This office building
was sold in March, 2000 and the Company will cease to consolidate the accounts
of the Trust effective with the date of sale.
As of December 25, 1999, the Trust reported the following assets and
liabilities in thousands

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company occupies premises under various non-cancelable operating leases
which include terms requiring it to pay a pro-rata portion of increased
operating expenses and real estate taxes. The leases expire on various dates
through April 2018, and certain of the leases contain options for renewal or
purchase of related equipment.
In January 1993, the Company entered into a three year lease with the Trust,
which required annual rental payments of $120,000, payable in equal monthly
installments of $10,000. This lease continued to be amended upon subsequent
expansions of the leased area and currently requires annual payments of
$531,000 payable in equal monthly installments of $44,000. The amended lease
term expires September 2010. In conjunction with the amendment of the lease in
September 1995, the Company began to consolidate the accounts of the Trust on
a prospective basis see Note 14. This building was sold in March, 2000 and
the Company was released from its lease obligation effective with the sale.
In June 1998, the Company entered into a ten year agreement to lease 200,000
square feet in Waltham, Massachusetts which is the site of the Company new
headquarters. In connection with its move in November, 1999, the Company
consolidated six other offices located around Massachusetts. The Company is
currently negotiating to sublease 50,000 square feet and 25,000 square feet of
this facility, each for a three-year term.
In August 1998, the Company entered into a twenty year agreement to lease
30,000 square feet in London, England to consolidate several branch locations
in the city. In September 1999, the Company moved its operations from this
location to another facility of equal size for a term of 15 years at a
substantially lower rent. The vacated facility was assigned to a major
european bank, without cost to the Company, for the entire remaining term. The
rental commitments on this assigned facility have not been included in the
minimum payments under non-cancelable leases below.

million, $51 million, $102 and $143 million, respectively. Future minimum
payments under non-cancelable leases at December 25, 1999 are as follows,

16. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company enters into various types of financial instruments in the normal
course of business. Fair values are estimated based on assumptions concerning
the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount
rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Accordingly, the fair
values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could
have been realized as of year end or that will be realized in the future.
The carrying amounts of the Company financial instruments, which include
accounts receivable, notes receivable, line of credit, accounts payable,
accrued salaries and wages, other accrued expenses, income taxes payable and
long-term debt approximate their fair values at December 26, 1998 and December
25, 1999.
17. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company decided to sell its management
consulting practice, the Business Strategy Group in an initiative to support
the Company new strategic direction. The cash transaction of $650 million
closed on March 10, 2000 and will result in a gain for the Company estimated
at $10 million which will be recorded in the first quarter of 2000.
Accordingly, the Company reported the results of operations of the Business
Strategy Group as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial
statements and related notes for all periods shown.
