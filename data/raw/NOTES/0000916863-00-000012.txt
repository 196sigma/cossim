-81 ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
WPS RESOURCES CORPORATION AND
WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
E. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a   NATURE OF OPERATIONS--WPS Resources Corporation is a holding
company. Approximately 71% of our 1999 revenues, 83% of our assets, and
substantially all of our 1999 net income was derived from our utility
subsidiaries. Our primary wholly-owned subsidiary, Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation, is an electric and gas utility. Wisconsin Public Service
supplies and distributes electric power and natural gas in its franchised
service territory in northeastern Wisconsin and an adjacent portion of the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Our other wholly-owned utility subsidiary,
Upper Peninsula Power Company, is an electric utility. Upper Peninsula Power
supplies and distributes electric energy in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
Another wholly-owned subsidiary, WPS Resources Capital Corporation, is a
holding company for our nonregulated businesses; WPS Energy Services, Inc.,
which is a diversified energy supply and services company and WPS Power
Development, Inc., which develops, owns and operates, through its own
subsidiaries, electric generation projects and provides service to the
electric power generation industry. Our other nonregulated subsidiaries
include Upper Peninsula Building Development Company, Penvest, Inc., and
subsidiaries of Wisconsin Public Service and WPS Power Development.
The term utility refers to the regulated activities of
Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power, while the term
nonutility refers to the activities of Wisconsin Public Service and
Upper Peninsula Power which are not regulated. The term nonregulated refers
to activities other than those of Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula
Power.
b   USE OF ESTIMATES--We prepare our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. We make estimates
and assumptions that affect reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions
include assets, liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
c   ACQUISITIONS AND NONREGULATED INVESTMENTS--In 1999, WPS Power
Development purchased the Sunbury plant, a 472-megawatt nameplate capacity
coal and oil-fired generation facility in Pennsylvania from
PP Resources, Inc., and 92 megawatts of hydro, steam, and diesel generation
facilities in Maine and New Brunswick, Canada from Maine Public Service
Company. In addition, WPS Power Development indirectly owns a two-thirds
interest in a merchant generating plant in Cassville, Wisconsin, the Stoneman
Power Plant, and owns a two-thirds interest in a coal pelletization plant
currently located in Alabama.
The emission allowances acquired in the Sunbury plant acquisition have
been assigned a value which is being amortized over the respective lives of
the allowances.
-82   At WPS Energy Services, the price paid in excess of fair value for
identifiable assets acquired in 1995 and 1999 are being amortized over
five-year periods.
d   CONSOLIDATION--We consolidate all majority-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.
e   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES--In June 1998, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities. This statement requires all derivatives to be measured at fair
value and recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends upon the use of the derivative and its resulting
designation. Unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met, changes in
the derivative fair value must be recognized currently in earnings.
In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137. This new statement delays the
effective date of Statement No. 133 to fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2000. We will be adopting Statement No. 133 on January 1, 2001.
We have certain fixed price contracts for future purchases of
commodities in our utility business that may be considered derivatives under
Statement No. 133. We believe these contracts would qualify as hedges under
current interpretations. Based on the limited number of contracts as of
December 31, 1999, we do not expect the amount of derivative assets and
liabilities that would be recognized on our balance sheet to be significant.
We are currently reviewing the impact of implementing Statement No. 133
at our nonregulated subsidiaries. At this time, we do not know the effect
that Statement No. 133 will have on our financial statements. We expect that
substantially all of the derivatives used by WPS Energy Services to hedge
price risk associated with firm commitments and inventory will qualify for
hedge accounting. Statement No. 133, in part, allows special hedge accounting
for fair value and cash flow hedges. Statement No. 133 provides that the gain
or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a fair value
hedging instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk be recognized currently in earnings in the
same accounting period. Statement No. 133 provides that the effective portion
of the gain or loss on a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow
hedging instrument be reported as a component of other comprehensive income.
The effective portion of the gain or loss will be reclassified into earnings
in the period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument, if any, must be recognized currently in earnings.
Prior to the adoption of these new accounting requirements in January of
2001, we will continue to account for price risk management activities under
existing accounting standards. Under these standards, we have not experienced
significant price risk activities at our utility operations because much of
the utility price risk exposure is recoverable through customer rates.
WPS Energy Services experiences price risk under the existing accounting
pronouncements. WPS Energy Services records gains or losses on derivatives
related to firm commitments as adjustments to the cost of sales or to revenues
when the related transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses on
derivatives associated with forecasted transactions are recorded when the
forecasted transactions affect earnings. WPS Power Development experiences
electric power price risk, but does not use derivatives to manage risk.
-83   f   PROPERTY ADDITIONS, MAINTENANCE, AND RETIREMENTS OF UTILITY
PLANT--Utility plant is stated at the original cost of construction which
includes an allowance for funds used during construction. The cost of
renewals and betterments of units of property as distinguished from minor
items of property is capitalized as an addition to the utility plant
accounts. Except for land, no gain or loss is recognized in connection with
ordinary retirements of utility property units. The cost of units of property
retired, sold, or otherwise disposed of, plus removal, less salvage, are
charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Maintenance, repair,
replacement, and renewal costs associated with items not qualifying as units
of property are generally charged to operating expense.
Nonutility property and nonregulated property follow a similar policy
except that interest is capitalized during construction and gains and losses
are recognized in connection with retirements.
We capitalize software in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountant Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. We
capitalize certain costs related to software developed or obtained for
internal use and amortize those costs to operating expense over the estimated
useful life of the related software.
g   ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION--Approximately 50% of
Wisconsin Public Service retail jurisdictional construction work in progress
expenditures are subject to allowance for funds used during construction.
Wisconsin Public Service uses a factor based on its overall cost of capital.
Certain major new generating facilities earn an allowance for funds used
during construction based on total construction work in progress expenditures.
This includes the combustion turbine being constructed at West Marinette for
Madison Gas and Electric. For 1999, Wisconsin Public Service allowance for
funds used during construction retail rate was approximately 106%. A
separately negotiated rate, however, is being used for the combustion turbine
being constructed for Madison Gas and Electric. Upper Peninsula Power
construction work in progress expenditures are not subject to retail
jurisdictional allowance for funds used during construction.
Allowance for funds used during construction is recorded on
Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power wholesale
jurisdictional electric construction work in progress at debt and equity
percentages specified in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Uniform
System of Accounts. For 1999, the allowance for funds used during
construction wholesale rate was approximately 67% for Wisconsin Public
Service and 53% for Upper Peninsula Power.
h   LEASES--Wisconsin Public Service accounts for the agreement to
purchase power from the De Pere Energy Center LLC an affiliate of SkyGen LLC
as a capital lease according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 13, Accounting For Leases. On June 14, 1999, Wisconsin Public Service
recorded a leased asset and a lease obligation equal to the present value of
the minimum lease payments. The leased asset is depreciated over 25 years,
the life of the contract.
i   DEPRECIATION--Straight-line depreciation expense is recorded over
the estimated useful life of property and includes amounts for estimated
removal and salvage. Depreciation rates for Wisconsin Public Service were
approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin effective January 1,
1999. Wisconsin Public Service also uses the rates established by the
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to depreciate its property in the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Depreciation of the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant
-84 is covered in a separate order from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
as explained below.
Depreciation rates for Upper Peninsula Power were approved by the
Michigan Public Service Commission on January 1, 1994 and remain in effect
through 2001. A new depreciation study will be filed with the
Michigan Public Service Commission in early 2001, with new rates expected to
become effective January 1, 2002.
Depreciation expense also includes accruals for nuclear decommissioning.
These accruals are not included in the annual composite rates shown below. An
explanation of this item is included in Note 1l.

Property recently acquired from Maine Public Service and PP Resources
is depreciated using various lives. Depreciable lives are as long as 40 years
on the Maine and Canada property and as long as 30 years on the Sunbury
property. Property at the Stoneman plant is also depreciated using various
lives. Some of the lives are as long as 40 years. Other nonutility and
nonregulated property is depreciated using straight-line depreciation. Asset
lives range from five to ten years.
Depreciation for the Kewaunee plant is being accrued based on a 1997
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin order. The order allows for full cost
recovery by the end of 2002. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
depreciation rate order effective for 1999 also includes a change in
methodology for the Kewaunee plant after steam generators have been replaced.
The replacement is estimated for completion in the fall of 2001. At that time,
the unrecovered basis of the Kewaunee plant, including the new steam
generators, will be recovered over an 85-year remaining life using the
sum-of-the-years depreciation method.
j   IMPAIRMENT--Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
to be Disposed of, requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses
resulting from application of this statement are reported in income in the
period the recognition criteria are first applied and met. This statement
does not have a material impact on the current carrying amount of our assets.
k   NUCLEAR FUEL--The quantity of heat produced for the generation of
electric energy by the Kewaunee plant is the basis for the amortization of the
costs of nuclear fuel to electric production fuel expense. Costs amortized to
electric fuel expense assume no salvage values for uranium and plutonium.
-85 Included in the costs was an amount for ultimate disposal. These costs are
recovered currently from customers in rates. The ultimate storage of fuel is
handled by the United States Department of Energy pursuant to a contract. The
contract was required by the Nuclear Waste Act of 1982. The Department of
Energy receives quarterly payments for the storage of fuel based on
generation. Spent nuclear fuel storage space is provided at the Kewaunee
plant on an interim basis. The expenses associated with this storage are
recognized as current operating costs. With minor plant modifications planned
for 2001, the Kewaunee plant should have sufficient fuel storage capacity
until the end of its useful life in 2013. At December 31, 1999, the
accumulated provision for nuclear fuel totaled $1627 million compared with
$1566 million at December 31, 1998.
l   NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING--Nuclear decommissioning costs to date
have been accrued over the estimated service life of the Kewaunee plant,
recovered currently from customers in rates, and deposited in external trusts.
Such costs totaled $92 million in 1999, $172 million in 1998, and
$161 million in 1997. The decrease in 1999 was the result of the
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval of a change in
Wisconsin Public Service decommissioning funding levels in a rate order
issued on January 14, 1999. The revised funding level continues to use a
recovery period ending in 2002 as described in Note 1i.
Based on the standard cost escalation assumptions required by a
July 1994 Public Service Commission of Wisconsin order, the undiscounted
amount of Wisconsin Public Service decommissioning costs forecasted to be
expended between the years 2013 and 2043 is $6752 million under the revised
funding plan which became effective in 1999. In developing the funding plan,
a long-term after-tax earnings rate of approximately 53% was assumed.
Wisconsin Public Service share of the Kewaunee plant decommissioning
is estimated to be $2007 million in current dollars based on a site-specific
study. The study, which was performed in 1998, uses immediate dismantlement
as the method of decommissioning and assumes shutdown in 2013. As of
December 31, 1999, the market value of the external nuclear decommissioning
trusts totaled $1981 million. Based on that study, Wisconsin Public
Service contributions for 2000 under the 1999 Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin rate order will be $83 million.
Depreciation expense includes future decommissioning costs collected in
customer rates and an offsetting charge for earnings from external trusts. As
of December 31, 1999, the accumulated provision for depreciation and
decommissioning included accumulated provisions for decommissioning totaling
$1981 million. Realized trust earnings totaled $46 million in 1999 33 million in 1998, and $37 million in 1997. Unrealized trust earnings
totaled $162 million in 1999, $168 million in 1998, and $138 million in
1997. Unrealized gains, net of tax, in external trusts are reflected as an
increase to the decommissioning reserve, since decommissioning expense will be
recognized as the gains are realized, in accordance with regulatory
requirements.
Investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts are recorded at market
value. Investments at December 31, 1999 consisted of 610% equity securities
and 390% corporate and municipal debt securities. The investments classified
as utility plant are presented net of related income tax effects on unrealized
gains and represent the amount of assets available to accomplish
decommissioning. The nonqualified trust investments designated to pay income
taxes when unrealized gains become realized are classified as other assets.
An offsetting regulatory liability reflects the expected reduction in future
rates as unrealized gains in the nonqualified trust are realized. Information
-86 regarding the cost and market value of the external nuclear decommissioning
trusts is set forth below

m   CASH AND EQUIVALENTS--We consider short-term investments with
an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
n   REVENUE AND CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES--We accrue revenues related to
electric and gas service. These accruals include estimated amounts for
service rendered but not billed. Approximately 12% of our total revenue is
from companies in the paper products industry.
Automatic fuel adjustment clauses are used for Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission wholesale-electric and the Michigan Public Service Commission
retail-electric portions of Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula
Power businesses.
The Wisconsin retail-electric portion of Wisconsin Public Service
business uses a cost variance range approach. This range is based on a
specific estimated fuel cost for the forecast year. If Wisconsin Public
Service actual fuel costs fall outside this range, a hearing can be held
resulting in an adjustment to future rates.
The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has approved a modified
one-for-one gas cost recovery plan for Wisconsin Public Service. Utilities
were given the choice between continuing under a modified one-for-one gas cost
recovery plan or switching to an incentive gas cost recovery mechanism.
Implementation of the modified one-for-one gas cost recovery plan began in
January 1999. This plan allows Wisconsin Public Service to pass changes in
the cost of gas purchased from its suppliers on to system gas customers,
subject to regulatory review.
Billings to Upper Peninsula Power customers under the Michigan Public
Service Commission jurisdiction include base rate charges and a power supply
cost recovery factor. Approximately 44% of Upper Peninsula Power operating
expenses are power supply costs. Upper Peninsula Power receives
Michigan Public Service Commission approval each year to recover projected
power supply costs by establishment of power supply cost recovery factors.
-87 These factors are subject to annual reconciliation to actual costs and permit
100% recovery of allowed power supply costs. Any over or under recovery is
deferred on Upper Peninsula Power balance sheet. Additional billings or
refunds are made to relieve these deferrals.
Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power are required to
provide service and grant credit to customers within their service
territories. Wisconsin Public Service is precluded from discontinuing service
to residential customers during certain periods of the year. Wisconsin Public
Service and Upper Peninsula Power continually review their customers'
credit-worthiness and obtain deposits or refund deposits accordingly.
o   REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES--Wisconsin Public Service and
Upper Peninsula Power are subject to the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenue associated
with certain incurred costs. Revenue will be recovered from customers through
the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are
refundable in future customer rates. The following regulatory assets and
liabilities were reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31

As of December 31, 1999, most of Wisconsin Public Service regulatory
assets are being recovered through rates charged to customers over periods
ranging from one to ten years. Recovery periods for Upper Peninsula Power
regulatory assets are up to 35 years. Carrying costs for all of
Wisconsin Public Service regulatory assets are being recovered except for
those associated with environmental costs. No carrying costs are being
recovered for Upper Peninsula Power regulatory assets in 1999. Starting in
2000, Upper Peninsula Power is permitted to recover carrying costs on
environmental regulatory assets. Based on prior and current rate treatment
for such costs, we believe it is probable that Wisconsin Public Service and
Upper Peninsula Power will continue to recover from customers the regulatory
assets described above.
See Notes 11 and 12 for specific information on pension and income tax
related regulatory liabilities. See Note 13 for information on environmental
remediation deferred costs.
p   INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS--Investments include Wisconsin Public
Service ownership interests in Wisconsin River Power Company and Wisconsin
Valley Improvement Company. Income related to these investments is included
in other income and deductions using the equity method of accounting. Other
assets include operating deposits for jointly-owned plants, the cash surrender
value of life insurance policies, the long-term portion of energy conservation
loans to customers, and the decommissioning trust investments designated for
payment of income taxes.
q   STOCK OPTIONS--Beginning in 1999, we issued options under our
stock option plans. We account for these plans using the intrinsic value
based method described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The intrinsic value based method
only records compensation expense for the excess of the quoted market price of
the stock at the measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire the stock. See Note 8 for more information on our stock option plans.
r   RECLASSIFICATIONS--Certain prior year financial statement amounts
have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.
-89   s   RETIREMENT OF DEBT--Historically, gains or losses resulting from
the settlement of long-term utility debt obligations have been deferred and
amortized concurrent with rate recovery as required by regulators. NOTE 2--JOINTLY-OWNED UTILITY FACILITIES

Wisconsin Public Service share of direct expenses for these plants is
included in the corresponding operating expenses in the consolidated
statements of income. Wisconsin Public Service has supplied its own financing
for all jointly-owned projects.
We have an agreement with Madison Gas and Electric Company, which is
contingent upon steam generator replacement, that Wisconsin Public Service
will acquire Madison Gas and Electric 178% share of the Kewaunee plant.
This will increase Wisconsin Public Service ownership in the Kewaunee plant
to 590%. See Note 13 for additional information regarding the Kewaunee
plant. NOTE 3--CAPITAL LEASE
In June 1999, Phase I of a 25-year power purchase contract became
effective with the De Pere Energy Center LLC. We have accounted for the
contract as a capital lease. In Phase I, an initial asset and corresponding
obligation were recorded at $741 million. The asset and obligation represent
the present value of minimum lease payments. Excluded from the payments are
executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes. When the contract
expires in 2024, Wisconsin Public Service may renew the contract for two
additional five-year periods with proper notice. The leased asset is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the original 25-year term of the
contract. The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments,
excluding executory costs, under the De Pere Energy Center LLC capital lease                    -90

NOTE 5--LONG-TERM DEBT
In November 1999, we issued $1500 million of 700% unsecured senior
notes due in 2009. At Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power,
utility plant assets secure first mortgage bonds. In December 1998,
Wisconsin Public Service issued $500 million of 608% senior notes due in
2028 secured by a pledge of first mortgage bonds. The 1998 notes become
unsecured if Wisconsin Public Service retires all of its outstanding first
mortgage bonds.
WPS Resources is not required to make sinking fund payments on our
outstanding debt. Wisconsin Public Service also has no sinking fund payment
requirements. Upper Peninsula Power, however, is required to make bond
sinking fund payments for its outstanding first mortgage bonds.
PDI New England and PDI Canada, subsidiaries of WPS Power Development, make
semiannual installment payments on a $240 million nonrecourse term loan
obtained in 1999 for financing the purchase of Maine Public Service
generating assets. A schedule of all debt payments including bond maturities

As of December 31, 1999, $80 million has been drawn against WPS Power
Development revolving credit note of $115 million, which is secured by the
assets of the Stoneman plant. An additional $33 million, which is to be
borrowed in the year 2000, has been committed against this note. The note,
which is guaranteed by WPS Resources, is due in 2000 or when the plant is
converted to a gas-fired combined cycle facility. NOTE 6--COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES
OF SUBSIDIARY TRUST
On July 30, 1998, WPSR Capital Trust I issued $500 million of trust
preferred securities to the public. The Trust is a Delaware business trust.
WPS Resources owns all of the outstanding trust common securities of the
Trust, and the only asset of the Trust is $515 million of subordinated
debentures that we issued. The debentures are due on June 30, 2038 and bear
interest at 70% per year. The terms and interest payments on the debentures
correspond to the terms and distributions on the trust preferred securities.
We have consolidated the preferred securities of the Trust into our financial
statements. We reflect the interest payments on the debentures as
Distributions - preferred securities of subsidiary trust. These payments
are tax deductible by WPS Resources.
We may defer interest payments on the debentures for up to
20 consecutive quarters. This would cause the deferral of distributions on
the trust preferred securities as well. If we would defer interest payments,
interest and distributions would continue to accrue. We would also accrue
compounding interest on the deferred amounts. We may redeem all or part of
the debentures after July 30, 2003. This would require the Trust to redeem an
equal amount of trust securities at face value plus any accrued interest and
unpaid distributions. We entered into a limited guarantee of payment of
distributions, redemption payments, and liquidation payments with respect to
the trust preferred securities. This guarantee, together with our obligations
under the debentures, and under other related documents, provides a full and
unconditional guarantee by us of amounts due on the outstanding trust
preferred securities.
-92 NOTE 7--COMMON EQUITY
Effective December 1999, we commenced purchasing common stock on the
open market to meet annual requirements of the Stock Investment Plan. From
January 1999 through November 1999, we issued new stock to satisfy shareholder
and employee purchase requirements under our Stock Investment Plan. We also
purchase stock on the open market in connection with our stock-based employee
benefit plans.
In December 1996, we adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan. The plan is
designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors to protect
shareholders and the company if efforts are made to gain control of our
company in a manner that is not in our best interests or the best interests of
shareholders. The plan gives existing shareholders, under certain
circumstances, the right to purchase stock at a discounted price. The rights
expire on December 11, 2006.
At December 31, 1999, we had $3354 million of retained earnings
available for dividends. Wisconsin Public Service is restricted by a
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin order to paying normal common stock
dividends of no more than 1090% of the previous year common stock dividend
without the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin approval. Special
dividends may be declared in order to maintain utility common equity levels
consistent with those allowed by the regulators. Wisconsin law prohibits
Wisconsin Public Service from making loans to or guaranteeing obligations of
WPS Resources or our other subsidiaries.
Upper Peninsula Power indentures relating to first mortgage bonds
contain certain limitations on the payment of cash dividends on common stock.
Under the most restrictive of these provisions, approximately $64 million of
consolidated retained earnings were available at December 31, 1999, for the
payment of common stock cash dividends by Upper Peninsula Power.
During 1999, we made equity infusions of $600 million to
Wisconsin Public Service. Wisconsin Public Service paid special common
dividends of $250 million to WPS Resources in 1999. The equity infusions and
special dividends allowed Wisconsin Public Service average equity
capitalization ratio for ratemaking to remain at about its target level of
540% as established by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in its most
recent rate order. NOTE 8--STOCK OPTION PLANS
In 1999, shareholders approved the WPS Resources Corporation 1999 Stock
Option Plan for certain management personnel. In December 1999, the Board of
Directors approved the WPS Resources Corporation 1999 Non-Employee Directors
Stock Option Plan. Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations are used to account for
these plans. Accordingly, no compensation costs have been recognized for these
plans in 1999. Had compensation cost been determined consistent with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation, net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
pro forma amounts indicated below                    -93

Under the provisions of our 1999 Stock Option Plan, options cannot be
granted for more than an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares and no single
employee can be granted options for more than 400,000 shares during any
five-year period. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may
grant options at any time. No options may be granted after February 10,
2004, under this plan. All options have a ten-year life. The exercise
price of each option is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the
date the option was granted. Options granted on May 6, 1999 have an
exercise price of $29875. One-fourth of the options granted May 6, 1999
become vested and exercisable on February 11 of each of the first four
years beginning February 11, 2000.
Under the provisions of our 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option
Plan, the aggregate number of shares for which options may be granted under
the plan cannot exceed 100,000. Options are granted at the discretion of the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be granted
under this plan after December 31, 2008. All options have a ten-year life,
but may not be exercised until one year after the date of grant. Options
granted under this plan are immediately vested. The exercise price of each
option is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date the option
was granted. Options were granted on December 9, 1999 with an exercise price
of $254375.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant

NOTE 9--FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair
value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to
estimate such value   Cash, Short-Term Investments, Energy Conservation Loans, Notes Payable,
and Outstanding Commercial Paper: The carrying amount approximates fair value
due to the short maturity of those investments and obligations.
Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts: The value of Wisconsin Public Service
nuclear decommissioning trust investments is recorded at market value.
Long-Term Debt, Preferred Stock, and Employee Stock Ownership Plan Loan
Guarantees: The fair value of Wisconsin Public Service long-term debt,
preferred stock, and Employee Stock Ownership Plan loan guarantees is
estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues or
on the current rates offered to Wisconsin Public Service for debt of the same
remaining maturity.

NOTE 10--PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
WPS Energy Services uses derivative financial and commodity instruments
to reduce market risk associated with changing prices of natural gas and
electricity sold at firm prices to customers. WPS Energy Services also
utilizes derivatives to manage market risk associated with anticipated energy
purchases, as well as trading activities. Derivatives may include futures and
forward contracts, price swap agreements, and call and put options.
Gains and losses on derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings
when it is no longer probable that the related forecasted transaction will
occur. Each accounting period, WPS Energy Services records gains or losses on
changes in market value of trading derivatives in other income. WPS Energy
Services recorded net trading gains of $01 million in 1999 and net trading
losses of $61 million in 1998.
At December 31, 1999, WPS Energy Services had outstanding 114 million
notional dekatherms of natural gas under futures and option agreements and
59 million notional dekatherms of natural gas under basis swap agreements in
order to manage market risk. These financial instruments expire at various
times through October 2001. WPS Energy Services has gas sales commitments
through October 2000 with a range of sale prices from $206 to $309 per
dekatherm and a range of associated gas purchase costs of $205 to $300 per
dekatherm.
At December 31, 1999, the fair value of trading instruments included
assets of $75 million and liabilities of $68 million. Virtually all trading
activities in 1999 and 1998 involved natural gas derivatives, except for a
small amount of electric trading transactions. At December 31, 1999,
WPS Energy Services had outstanding 14 million notional dekatherms of natural
gas under futures and option agreements and 17 million notional dekatherms of
natural gas under basis swap agreements for trading purposes.
-96 NOTE 11--EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
WPS Resources and our subsidiaries have non-contributory retirement
plans covering substantially all employees under which annual contributions
may be made to an irrevocable trust established to provide retired employees
with a monthly payment if conditions relating to age and length of service
have been met. The plans are administered and maintained by Wisconsin Public
Service. These plans are fully funded, and no contributions were made in
1999, 1998, or 1997.
WPS Resources and our subsidiaries also currently offer medical, dental,
and life insurance benefits to employees, retirees, and their dependents. The
expenses for active employees are expensed as incurred. We fund these
benefits through irrevocable trusts as allowed for income tax purposes. The
funded amounts at Wisconsin Public Service and Upper Peninsula Power, our
utility subsidiaries, have been expensed and recovered through customer rates.
Funded amounts associated with WPS Resources and all other nonregulated
subsidiaries have been expensed but are not recovered through customer rates.
Our non-administrative plan is a collectively bargained plan and, therefore,
is tax exempt. The investments in the trust covering administrative employees
are subject to federal unrelated business income taxes at a 396% tax rate.
All pension costs and postretirement plan costs are accounted for under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 87 and 106. The standards
require the cost of these benefits to be accrued as expense over the period in
which the employee renders service. The transition obligation for current and
future retirees is recognized over 20 years beginning in 1993.
The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the
plan benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the three one-year
periods ending December 31, 1999, 1998, and 1997, and a statement of the
funded status as of December 31, of each year

Under a contract with Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Upper Peninsula
Power had operated Wisconsin Electric Power Presque Isle Power Plant in
Michigan since 1988. That contract terminated on December 31, 1997, and all
employees at the plant became employees of Wisconsin Electric Power. In 1997,
Upper Peninsula Power recognized a $11 million pension curtailment loss and a
$04 million other benefit plan curtailment loss from the termination of the
Presque Isle Power Plant operating agreement.

Wisconsin Public Service has a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan
and Trust that held 1,912,002 shares of WPS Resources common stock market
value of approximately $480 million at December 31, 1999. At that date, the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan also had a loan guaranteed by Wisconsin Public
Service and secured by common stock. Principal and interest on the loan are
to be paid using contributions from Wisconsin Public Service and dividends on
our common stock held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Shares in the
Employee Stock Ownership Plan are allocated to participants as the loan is
repaid. Tax benefits from dividends paid to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan
are recognized as a reduction in Wisconsin Public Service cost of providing
service to customers. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has allowed
Wisconsin Public Service to include in cost of service an additional employer
contribution to the plan. The net effect of the tax benefits and of the
employer contribution is an approximately equal sharing of the tax benefits of
the program between customers and employees. NOTE 12--INCOME TAXES
We account for income taxes using the liability method as prescribed by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income tax liabilities are
established for all temporary differences in the book and tax basis of assets
and liabilities based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the taxes become payable. Taxes provided in prior years at

-101 NOTE 13--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
COAL CONTRACTS
To ensure a reliable, low-cost supply of coal, Wisconsin Public Service
entered into a long-term contract that has take-or-pay obligations totaling
$942 million from 2000 through 2016. The obligations are subject to force
majeure provisions which provide Wisconsin Public Service other options if the
specified coal does not meet emission limits which may be mandated in future
legislation. We believe that any amounts paid under the take-or-pay
obligations described above would be considered costs of service subject to
recovery in customer rates.
PURCHASED POWER
Wisconsin Public Service has several take-or-pay contracts for either
capacity or energy related to purchased power. These contracts total
$680 million through April 2003. We expect to recover these costs in future
customer rates.
LONG-TERM POWER SUPPLY
In November 1995, Wisconsin Public Service signed a 25-year agreement to
purchase power from De Pere Energy Center LLC an affiliate of SkyGen Energy
LLC, an independent power producer that built a cogeneration facility and is
selling electrical power to Wisconsin Public Service. Phase I of the project
went into operation in June of 1999 and is accounted for as a capital lease.
The amount recorded as a part of utility plant was $741 million. This amount
will be depreciated over 25 years, the term of the contract. Phase II is
currently projected to be operational within five years of the start of
Phase I. If Phase II becomes operational, an additional utility plant asset
of approximately $800 million will be recorded.
GAS COSTS
Wisconsin Public Service has natural gas supply and transportation
contracts that require total estimated demand payments of $1251 million
through October 2008.
In April 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued
Order No. 636 which required natural gas interstate pipelines to restructure
their sales and transportation services. As a result, Wisconsin Public
Service was obligated to pay for a portion of ANR Pipeline Company
transition costs through various Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved
surcharges. Though there may be additional transition costs, which could be
significant, the amount and timing of these costs are unknown at this time.
We expect to recover these costs in future customer rates since the
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and the Michigan Public Service
Commission have allowed such recovery to date.
NUCLEAR LIABILITY
The Price Anderson Act ensures that funds will be available to pay for
public liability claims arising out of a nuclear incident. Wisconsin Public
Service may be required to pay up to a maximum of $363 million per incident.
The payments will not exceed $41 million per incident in a given calendar
year. These amounts represent Wisconsin Public Service 412% ownership in
the Kewaunee plant.
-102 NUCLEAR PLANT OPERATION
On September 29, 1998, Wisconsin Public Service and Madison Gas and
Electric entered into an agreement pursuant to which Wisconsin Public Service
will acquire, at Madison Gas and Electric book value, Madison Gas and
Electric 178% share of the Kewaunee plant including Madison Gas and
Electric decommissioning trust assets and will assume Madison Gas and
Electric share of the decommissioning obligation. This agreement, the
closing of which is contingent upon regulatory approval and steam generator
replacement scheduled for the fall of 2001, will result in Wisconsin Public
Service ownership interest in the Kewaunee plant increasing to 590%.
The net book value of Wisconsin Public Service share of the Kewaunee
plant at December 31, 1999 is $282 million. In addition, the current cost of
Wisconsin Public Service share of the estimated costs to decommission the
Kewaunee plant, assuming early retirement, exceeds the trust assets at
December 31, 1999 by $26 million. On January 3, 1997, the Public Service
Commission of Wisconsin accepted Wisconsin Public Service recommendation to
accelerate recovery of the Wisconsin retail portion of both the current
undepreciated plant balance and the unfunded decommissioning costs over a
six-year period, 1997 through 2002. The Public Service Commission of
Wisconsin depreciation rate order authorizing new rates for 1999 includes a
change in methodology for recovery of the Kewaunee plant investment after new
steam generators have been installed, estimated to be the fall of 2001. At
that time, the unrecovered basis of the Kewaunee plant, including the new
steam generators, will be recovered over an 85 year remaining life using the
sum-of-the-years depreciation method.
CLEAN AIR REGULATIONS
Wisconsin Public Service is in compliance with both the Phase I and
Phase II sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission limits established by the
Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. We believe that all costs incurred
for additional compliance will be recoverable in future customer rates.
Wisconsin Public Service is evaluating the installation of a baghouse at
its Weston Unit 3 plant. Currently, an electrostatic precipitator is used as
a pollution control device, but it is in need of replacement due to
degradation. A baghouse is an alternative pollution control device to an
electrostatic precipitator. If the installation of the baghouse proceeds, it
is estimated that it will cost $257 million.
In late September of 1998, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency required certain states, including Wisconsin, to develop plans to
reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides from sources within the state by May of
2003. Compliance is required during the ozone season of May through
September. On a preliminary basis, Wisconsin Public Service projects
potential capital costs of between $625 million and $1120 million to comply
with possible future regulations. The annual operating and maintenance
expense associated with these possible future regulations are projected to
range from $20 million to $60 million. The costs depend on the
state-specific compliance method to be adopted in the future and the
effectiveness of the various technologies available for nitrogen oxide
emission control. Under Wisconsin Public Service current practice, the
capital costs as reflected in depreciation expenses and the annual operating
costs are anticipated to be recovered through future customer rates.
On December 24, 1998, Wisconsin Public Service joined other parties in a
petition challenging the Environmental Protection Agency regulations that
require Wisconsin to prepare and submit a nitrogen oxide implementation plan.
-103 On January 22, 1999, the State of Wisconsin intervened in the litigation and
challenged the geographic scope of the rule and the required timing for
implementation of nitrogen oxide controls within the state. The court heard
arguments on November 9, 1999. No decision has yet been rendered.
The Sunbury plant, acquired by WPS Power Development in November 1999,
currently purchases emission allowances to comply with air regulations.
Additional technology may be required by 2003 in order to comply with nitrogen
oxide standards. Expenditures for this technology could be significant.
MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT REMEDIATION
Wisconsin Public Service continues to investigate the environmental
cleanup of eight manufactured gas plant sites. The cleanup of
Wisconsin Public Service Stevens Point manufactured gas plant site is
complete with monitoring of the site continuing. Costs of this cleanup were
within the range expected for this site. Future investigation and cleanup
costs for the remaining seven sites are estimated in the range of
$343 million to $410 million. These estimates may be adjusted in the future
contingent upon remedial technology, regulatory requirements, and experience
gained through cleanup activities.
An initial liability for cleanup of $417 million was established with
an offsetting regulatory asset deferred charge. Of this amount,
approximately $31 million has been spent to date. Wisconsin Public Service
believes it will recover cleanup costs in current and future customer rates.
Carrying costs associated with the cleanup expenditures will not be
recoverable. Wisconsin Public Service has received $126 million in insurance
recoveries which are recorded as a reduction in the regulatory asset.
FUTURE UTILITY EXPENDITURES
We estimate utility plant construction expenditures at Wisconsin Public
Service for 2000 to be approximately $1446 million and construction
expenditures at Upper Peninsula Power for 2000 to be approximately
$84 million. Demand-side management expenditures at Wisconsin Public Service
are estimated to be $215 million in 2000. Of this amount, $177 million will
be recovered in rates in 2000 with the remainder expected to be recovered in
future rates. In addition, previously deferred demand-side management
expenditures of $178 million are being recovered from customers through 2002. NOTE 14--REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Wisconsin Public Service received a rate order in the Wisconsin
jurisdiction on January 15, 1999. The impact is an estimated $269 million
increase in electric revenues and an estimated $103 million increase in gas
revenues on an annual basis. The new rates are effective for 1999 and 2000.
The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin authorized a 121% return on
Wisconsin Public Service equity for 1999 and 2000.
Wisconsin Public Service received a new rate order in the Wisconsin
retail jurisdiction effective on January 1, 2000 because of a rate reopener
filed in July 1999. The impact is an estimated $211 million increase in
electric revenues for the year 2000. The reopener addressed a limited number
of issues for which information was not available when the original order for
1999 and 2000 was authorized. There were no changes to the 2000 gas revenues
or return on equity which remains at 121% for 2000.
-104 NOTE 15--SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS
Effective December 31, 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. Our reportable segments are managed separately due to
their different operating and regulatory environments. Our principal business
segments are the regulated electric utility operations of Wisconsin Public
Service and Upper Peninsula Power and the regulated gas utility operations of
Wisconsin Public Service. Our other reportable segments include WPS Energy
Services and WPS Power Development. WPS Energy Services is a diversified
energy supply and services company, and WPS Power Development is an electric
generation asset development company. The tables below and on the following
page present information for the respective years pertaining to our operations
segmented by lines of business. We restated 1998 and 1997 for comparative
purposes due to changes in our reportable segments. The changes include
adding a utility subtotal column and separating WPS Power Development from
Other due to its increase in significance.

F. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors of WPS Resources Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of WPS Resources Corporation a
Wisconsin corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and
the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income and
retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
WPS Resources Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.                        /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP                        ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin

WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION
M. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the Board of Directors of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of Wisconsin Public Service
Corporation a Wisconsin corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and retained earnings and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and subsidiary as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.                          /s/ Arthur Andersen LLP                          ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin
