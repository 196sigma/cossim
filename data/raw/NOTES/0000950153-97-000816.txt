These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the management
of SpeedFam International, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material

management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of SpeedFam
International, Inc. and consolidated subsidiaries as of May 31, 1996 and 1997,

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SpeedFam International, Inc. the Company, an Illinois corporation,
designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and services chemical mechanical
planarization, or CMP, systems used in the fabrication of semiconductor
devices and other high throughput, precision surface processing systems used in
the fabrication of thin film memory disk media, semiconductor wafers, and
general industrial components. In addition, the Company markets and distributes
slurries, parts, and expendables used in its customers' manufacturing processes.
The Company customers are primarily located in the United States, Europe, and
the Far East.
a Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and the following wholly owned subsidiaries:
SUBSIDIARIES          INCORPORATED
SpeedFam Corporation             United States
SpeedFam Limited               United Kingdom
SpeedFam GmbH                Germany
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Non-U.S. subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial
statements based upon fiscal years ended April 30. The Company fiscal year
ends on May 31.
The Company investments in the common stock of affiliates SpeedFam Co.,
Ltd. a Japanese corporation, 50% owned and Fujimi Corporation an Illinois
corporation, 50% owned are accounted for by the equity method using fiscal
years that end April 30 and May 31, respectively.
b Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include deposits in banks and highly liquid
short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Short-term investments are carried at cost which approximates market.
c Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $538, $1,172, and $2,795 in fiscal years 1995, 1996,
and 1997, respectively. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:

recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their
31
33
SPEEDFAM INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.
f Revenue Recognition
Sales of the Company products are recorded upon shipment or when the
product is accepted by the customer. Commission revenue from affiliates is
recorded upon shipment of product.
g Installation and Warranty Costs
Costs to be incurred by the Company related to product installation and
warranty fulfillment are accrued at the date of shipment, and are estimated by
the Company based on past experience. The accrual for product installation and
warranty fulfillment, included in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance
sheets, was $2,485 and $5,510 at the end of fiscal years 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
h Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company non-U.S. operations have been
translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.
Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing
throughout the period. Local currencies are considered the functional currencies
of the Company foreign entities. Foreign currency exchange rates used to
translate the financial statements are summarized below:
FOREIGN CURRENCY PER U.S.
DOLLAR
1995   1996    1997
Rates at balance sheet date:
Pound sterling    62    66    62

Japanese yen   8420   10507   12709
i Treasury Stock

Company treasury stock was retired upon completion of the Company initial
public offering of common stock on October 26, 1995 see note 14.
j Net Earnings Per Share
Net earnings per share data has been computed using the weighted average
number of shares of common stock and common equivalent shares from stock
options. Stock options issued during the 12-month period prior to the Company
initial public offering have been included in the calculation as if they were
outstanding for all periods presented.

l Patents and Trademarks

and $769 at the end of fiscal years 1996 and 1997, respectively, are amortized
on a straight-line basis over 17 years for patents and five years for
trademarks.
m Research, Development, and Engineering
Expenditures for research, development, and engineering of products and
processes are expensed as incurred.
n Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
o Employee Stock Plans
Effective June 1, 1996, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
option and stock purchase plans and, accordingly, does not recognize
compensation cost. As prescribed by SFAS No. 123, note 10 contains a summary of
the pro forma effects on reported net earnings and earnings per share for 1996
and 1997 as if the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost based on
the fair value of the options granted at grant date.

No provision is made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of wholly
owned non-U.S. subsidiaries and SpeedFam Co., Ltd., because it is the Company
present intention to reinvest substantially all the earnings of these
operations. At the end of fiscal year 1997, there was approximately $22,700 of
accumulated undistributed earnings of those operations. It is not practical for
the Company to compute the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on the
undistributed earnings.

In fiscal year 1996 the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement
with two U.S. banks. The credit agreement is for a $22,500 revolving line of
credit maturing April 14, 1999. The Company must meet certain financial
objectives each year as defined in the credit agreement. During fiscal 1997, the
Company paid off the outstanding balance on the unsecured revolving line of
credit.
On September 13, 1996, the Company negotiated an amendment to the $22,500
credit facility, providing for an additional $14,000 in a five-year unsecured
term loan to fund the construction of a new corporate headquarters and
manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona. As of May 31, 1997, no amounts were
outstanding on the term loan. Should the loan be utilized, terms of the loan
provide that principal will be repaid in fifteen 15 quarterly installments of
$350 each beginning in October 1997. The remaining outstanding balance will be
repaid at the end of the loan term. Interest on the term loan will accrue and
be paid monthly on the outstanding balance based on a 90-day LIBOR rate plus 140
basis points. Unless drawn upon, the term loan will expire September 29, 1997.
The term loan payable in monthly installments of $26 is secured by certain
machinery of SpeedFam Corporation.
On October 31, 1996, SpeedFam Limited in the United Kingdom, a wholly owned
subsidiary of SpeedFam International, Inc., entered into a 950 $1,543
Multi-Currency Revolving Line of Credit with the London branch of a U.S. bank.
The revolving line of credit is secured by property and equipment of the
subsidiary and is payable on demand. Interest accrues on the outstanding balance
at 20% above the bank base rate 60% at April 30, 1997 and is payable
monthly. As of April 30, 1997, no amounts were outstanding on this credit
facility.

7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
During fiscal year 1996, the Company entered into a technology license
agreement related to the development of a new product introduced during fiscal
year 1997. The agreement required the payment of $400 upon signing and a final
payment of $300 was made in September 1996. The agreement also obligates the
Company to make annual royalty payments of 55% of the Company net sales of
products using the licensed technology for ten years. The annual royalty
payments are subject to a minimum payment of $150 beginning in fiscal year 1998
and $200 for fiscal years 1999 to 2006.
The Company and its subsidiaries occupy certain manufacturing and office
facilities and use certain equipment under noncancelable operating leases
expiring at various dates through fiscal year 2001. Rental expense aggregated
approximately $611, $917, and $1,235 in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.

8 FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS
The notional amounts of foreign exchange contracts as of May 31, 1996 and
May 31, 1997 were as follows:
1996    1997
Forward exchange contracts to buy foreign currency. $17,980   $16,670
Forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currency. $ 1,224   $ 3,379
All currency forward contracts outstanding at May 31, 1997 have maturities
of less than one year and are primarily to buy or sell Japanese yen in exchange
for U.S. dollars. Management believes that these contracts should not subject
the Company to undue risk from foreign exchange movements, because gains and
losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets,
liabilities, and transactions being hedged. The fair value of these contracts
and the related deferred gains are insignificant.
9 SAVINGS AND PROFIT-SHARING PLANS
The Company maintains savings and profit-sharing plans for its employees.
The plans cover certain employees who meet length of service requirements.
Expense under the plans, determined by the Company Board of Directors,
aggregated $60, $1,443, and $2,414 in 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively.
10 STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company grants options to employees under the 1991 Employee Incentive
Stock Option Plan and the 1995 Stock Plan for Employees and Directors of the
Company. Under the plans, options to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of the
Company authorized but unissued common stock may be granted. Prior to fiscal
year 1995, stock options were granted at 100% to 110% of the value of the
Company common stock as determined
40

SPEEDFAM INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA
by an established formula. In fiscal year 1995, stock options were granted at
100% to 110% of the fair value of the Company common stock as determined by an
independent appraiser. Subsequent to fiscal year 1995 stock options are granted
at a price not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. The stock
options vest over five years i.e., 20% each year with the exception of 163,800
stock options issued in 1992, which vested immediately. The stock options expire
10 years after the grant date, except for 71,100 stock options which expire five
years after the grant date.

As permitted under SFAS No. 123, the Company has elected to follow APB No.
25 in accounting for stock-based awards to employees. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option and stock purchase
plans. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option and stock purchase
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for awards in
1996 and 1997 consistent with the

provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:
1996    1997
Net earnings as   $11,821   $20,219
Pro forma net   $11,763   $19,537
Earnings per share as    $116    $167
Pro forma earnings per    $116    $161
In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, pro forma net earnings
reflects only options granted in 1996 and 1997. Therefore, the full impact of
calculating compensation cost of options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in
the pro forma net income amounts presented above because compensation cost is
reflected over the options vesting period of five years, and compensation cost
for options granted prior to June 1, 1995 is not considered.
In calculating pro forma compensation, the fair value of each option is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model,
with the following weighted average assumptions for grants made in 1996 and
1997.
1996    1997
Dividend    None    None
Expected    56%     56%
Risk-free interest   635%    638%
Expected  3 years   3 years
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was
$868 per share and $1521 per share for 1996 and 1997, respectively.
The pro forma net earnings and earnings per share listed above includes
expense related to the Company 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The fair
value of grants under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated on the grant
date using the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants made in 1996 and 1997:
1996    1997
Dividend    None    None

The weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted during the year

11 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan qualifies under Section 423
of the Internal Revenue Code and reserves 500,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the plan. The plan provides that eligible employees may purchase
stock at 85% of its fair value on specified dates. Under the plan, the Company
sold 70,803 shares in fiscal 1997.

related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 1997. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the management of
SpeedFam Co., Ltd. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SpeedFam Co., Ltd. the Company was incorporated in 1971 as a joint
venture owned equally by two corporate shareholders, Obara Corporation, a
Japanese company; and SpeedFam International, Inc., a U.S. company.
The Company and its domestic subsidiaries and affiliated companies conduct
operations primarily in Japan, but have subsidiaries and branches in Taiwan,
South Korea, India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China.
The Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates are engaged in the design,
engineering, manufacture, and distribution mainly of lapping and polishing
equipment and consumables, through-feed grinders, cleaning machines, and
measuring equipment used in high technology industries.
a Basis of Presentation
The Company and its consolidated Japanese subsidiaries maintain their books
of account in conformity with the financial accounting standards of Japan. The
Company non-Japanese subsidiaries maintain their books of account in
conformity with the financial accounting standards of the countries in which
they are located. The consolidated financial statements presented herein in U.S.
dollars have been adjusted to conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and the following subsidiaries:
PERCENTAGE OF           FISCAL
SUBSIDIARIES                   OWNERSHIP    LOCATION    YEAR END
SpeedFam Clean System Co., Ltd.    6125%    Japan      March 31
Saku Seiki Co., Ltd.    5354    Japan      March 31
SpeedFam    10000    Taiwan     March 31
SpeedFam Korea    10000    South Korea   March 31
SpeedFam India Pvt. Ltd.    8200    India      March 31

eliminated. The Company fiscal year ends on April 30.
The Company investments in the common stock of affiliates, Met Coil Ltd.
50% owned; CRT K.K. 2308% owned; and Xevios Corporation 50% owned,
acquired in fiscal year 1996 are accounted for by the equity method.

d Short-term Investments
The Company classifies its debt and equity securities into one of three
categories: trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. Trading securities
are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near
term. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which the Company has
the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity. All other securities
not included in trading or held-to-maturity are classified as
available-for-sale.
Trading and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value.
Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for the
amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts. Unrealized holding gains and
losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are
excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of
available-for-sale securities are determined on a specific identification basis.
A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale or held-to-maturity
security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a
reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to
earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and
discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related
held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest
method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.
e Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
on the declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $2,312, $2,148, and $3,542 in fiscal years 1995, 1996,
and 1997, respectively. The estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:
Buildings and   3 to 65 years
Machinery and   3 to 12 years
Furniture and   2 to 20 years
Leasehold      2 years
f Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined principally by the
first-in, first-out FIFO method, or market.
g Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
h Revenue Recognition
Sales of the Company products are recorded upon shipment.

i Warranty Costs
Generally, the Company provides a one-year warranty against manufacturer
defects on all machines sold. Provision for warranty expense is provided based
upon an estimate derived from experience factors.
j Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of the Company non-Japanese operations have been
translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates or
balance sheet date of the subsidiary, if different. Results of operations are
translated using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period.
Local currencies are considered the functional currencies of the Company
non-Japanese entities. Foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the
financial statements are summarized below:
FOREIGN CURRENCY PER JAPANESE YEN
1995     1996     1997
Rates at balance sheet date:
South Korean Won March. 1167/100   1378/100   1391/100
Taiwan Dollar NT$ March.    341     391     449
India Rupee RPS March.    280     306     339
Singapore Dollar S$.   6021     7409     8736
Thailand     341     415     456
Japanese Yen Y per U.S. $.   8420    10507    12709
k Significant Customer
The Company had sales to a Japanese company that amounted to approximately
105%, 112%, and 125% of net sales in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997,
respectively.
l Research and Development
Research and development expense amounted to approximately $1,748, $6,651,
and $11,488 in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Such
expenditures are expensed as incurred.
m Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Company management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
n Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 1997 financial statement presentation.

A reconciliation between the Company effective tax rate and the
expected tax rate of 51% in Japan on earnings before income taxes and minority
interest is as follows:

No provision is made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of
non-Japan subsidiaries. The Company believes that the amount of income taxes
that would be incurred if these earnings were remitted would not be significant
because of available tax credits.
The Company corporate tax returns through April 30, 1994 have been
examined by the Japanese tax authorities.

claim amounting to $285 against the branch for losses and damages suffered by a
plaintiff as a result of the branch alleged failure to meet certain
specifications for a machine sold to the plaintiff. The branch is contesting the
claim and has filed a defense in respect thereof. Based on legal advice
obtained, Company management is of the opinion that no ultimate liability will
arise. Accordingly, no provision has been made in the financial statements with
respect to this claim.
10 PENSION AND SEVERANCE BENEFITS
The Company maintains pension and severance benefit plans for its
employees. Employees who leave the Company upon retirement because of age or
sever their connection with the Company for reasons other than dismissal for
cause are entitled to lump-sum payments based on their current rate of pay and
length of service.
Effective June 1, 1984 the Company adopted an insured pension plan which
also covers employees of SpeedFam Clean Systems Co., Ltd., the terms of which
provide for the ultimate funding of retirement benefits when due. Premiums paid
under the insured plan constitute the funding of the current costs of the
liability under the plan and the funding of the related past service costs over
a 15-year period.
The funded status of the insured pension plan at the end of fiscal years
1996 and 1997 is as follows:
1996    1997
Actuarial present value of benefit obligations:
Vested  $1,205  $1,197
Nonvested    26    53
Accumulated benefit  $1,231  $1,250
Projected benefit  $1,775  $1,662

Expected long-term return on plan assets. 30%   30%   30 
Plan assets represent the Company share of funds invested by a trustee in
pooled accounts comprised of cash in banks, securities, and real estate.
A separate retirement benefits program for directors and statutory auditors
is not covered by the pension plan described above. The program provides that
directors and statutory auditors who retire or sever their connection with the
Company are entitled to lump-sum payments based on current rates of pay,
determined according to their title and the length of service. Directors and
statutory auditors may also be granted, at the discretion of the Company,
additional lump-sum payments for meritorious service. It is not the policy of
the Company to fund these retirement and severance benefits, but provision has
been made in the financial statements for the estimated accrued liabilities
under the plan. The liability related to these retirement benefits included in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal years 1996 and
1997 amounted to $3,150 and $3,820, respectively. The plan was amended during
fiscal year 1996 and the resulting past service costs of $1,008 are being
amortized over a period of five years. Unamortized past service cost at the end
of fiscal years 1996 and 1997 amounting to $883 and $548 is classified as other
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The retirement benefit
expenses amounted to $181, $520, and $1,545 in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and
1997, respectively.
Two subsidiaries of the Company have separate employee retirement and
severance plan arrangements. Payments with respect to voluntary severance are
less in amount than payments for involuntary severance and retirement. The
subsidiaries have recorded estimated liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal years 1996 and 1997 of $272 and
$228, respectively, based upon the amount, net of the benefits to be paid by a
government-sponsored small enterprise mutual aid retirement fund, which would be
payable if all employees had to retire voluntarily. Plan assets plus the accrued
liability approximate vested benefits. The expense related to these employee
retirement and severance plans amounted to $20, $222, and $67 in fiscal years
1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. The Company believes that the effect of not
adopting SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, for these plans is
not material to the consolidated financial statements.
11 LEGAL RESERVE AND CASH DIVIDENDS
The Japanese Commercial Code provides that earnings in an amount equal to
at least 10% of retained earnings be appropriated as a legal reserve, until such
reserve equals 25% of stated common stock. This legal reserve is not available
for dividends but may be used to reduce a deficit or may be transferred to
stated common stock. Certain non-Japanese subsidiaries are also required to
appropriate their earnings to legal reserves under the laws of the respective
countries. The legal reserve included as a component of retained earnings at the
end of fiscal years 1996 and 1997 amounted to $513 and $523, respectively.

13 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments at April 30, 1996 and 1997 include cash
equivalents, trade receivables, short-term investments, short-term loans, trade
payables, noncurrent receivables, long-term debt, and obligations under capital
leases. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, trade receivables, short-term
loans, and trade payables approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments. The fair value of short-term investments has been
determined based on quoted market prices and approximates their financial
statement carrying values. The fair value of the Company noncurrent
receivables and long-term debt has been determined based on discounted cash
flows using current interest rates of similar instruments, and is not materially
different from their financial statement carrying values.
