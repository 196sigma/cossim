ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Scientific Learning Corporation We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Scientific Learning Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at a2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Scientific Learning Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  s/ERNST YOUNG LLP San Francisco, California

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Scientific Learning Corporation develops, distributes and licenses technology that accelerates learning by improving the processing efficiency of the brain. Our patented products build learning capacity by rigorously and systematically applying neuroscience-based learning principles to improve the fundamental cognitive skills required to read and learn. To facilitate the use of our products, we offer a variety of on-site and remote professional and technical services, as well as phone, email and web-based support.We sell primarily to K-12 schools in the United States through a direct sales force. All of our activities are in one operating segment. Our current operating assumptions and projections reflect managements best estimate of future revenue, operating expenses, and capital commitments, and indicate that our current sources of liquidity, including the bank line of credit with Comerica, should be sufficient to fund operations through at least December 31, 2010. We were incorporated in 1995 in the State of California and were reincorporated in 1997 in the State of Delaware. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimated. Revenue Recognition We derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees.Software license revenue is recognized in accordance with accounting standards for software companies.There are four basic criteria which must be met to recognize revenue. These are: 1 persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; 2 delivery of the product has occurred; 3 a fixed or determinable fee; and 4 the probability that the fee will be collected.The application of the relevant accounting standards requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types. In cases where we grant extended payment terms to school customers, we determine if the fixed or determinable fee crite
rion is met by reference to the customers specific funding sources, especially where the payment terms extend into the customers next fiscal year. If we determine that the fixed or determinable fee criterion is not met at the inception of the arrangement, we defer revenue recognition until the payments become due. Booked sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements e.g., Fast ForWord software licenses, Progress Tracker, our Internet-based participant tracking service, support, training, implementation management, and other services.We recognize revenue using the residual method, whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements. VSOE of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and, for support services, is also measured by the renewal price.We are required to exercise judgment in determining whethe
r VSOE of fair value exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent. The value of software licenses, services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized.All revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products.Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below.Direct costs related to deferred software license revenue are deferred until the related license revenue is recognized. Multiple contracts with the same customer are generally accounted for as separate arrangements, except in cases where contracts are so closely related that they are effectively part of a single arrangement.  45 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Product revenue Product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows Perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis.Revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method.If VSOE of fair value does not exist for all the undelivered elements, all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered. Term licenses software licensed for a specific time period, generally three to twelve months.Revenue is recognized ratably over the license term. Individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant.Revenue is recognized over the average period of use, typically six weeks. Service and support revenue Service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training, implementation, technical and professional services, online services and customer support. Training, technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis.If VSOE of fair value exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses, services revenue is recognized as performed.If VSOE of fair value does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses, service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement.Revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed. If an arrangement includes services that are essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize the fees for the software license and the services using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting standards for software and service companies.We estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project. Recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and money market funds, are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. Our cash and cash equivalents consisted of the following in thousands  December 31  2009 2008 Cash on deposit 502 6,753 Money market funds 20,177 797  20,679 7,550 We apply ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. Level 1 financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of money market funds cash equivalents of approximately $202 million as of December 31, 2009 and approximately $68 million at December 31, 2008.We have no Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2009 or at December 31, 2008. Accounts Receivable We conduct business primarily with public school districts and speech and language professionals in the United States.We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments. We adjust this allowance periodically based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs.  46 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Inventories Product inventories, which are primarily finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets.Cost is determined using a weighted average approach, which approximates the first-in first-out method. If inventory costs exceed expected market value due to obsolescence or lack of demand adjustments are recorded for the difference between the cost and the market value. Deferred charges We defer royalty charges as incurred and recognize the expense over the term of the related license agreements or service periods. These deferred charges are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and in Other assets on our balance sheet. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value. Concentration of Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are invested in a major financial institution in the United States.Such deposits may be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions.Management believes that the financial institutions that hold the Companys investments are financially sound and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments. Our accounts receivable are primarily from booked sales to customers located primarily in the United States.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers.We do not require collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those accounts that we have determined to be doubtful of collection.At December 31, 2008 one customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable. No customers accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable at December 31, 2009. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2007. No customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2009 or 2008. We have no off-balance sheet concentration of credit risk, such as foreign exchange contracts, option contracts or other hedging arrangements. Our concentration of royalty arrangements potentially exposes us to risk. If we were to lose our rights under these arrangements, this could materially impact our booked sales, revenue and net income. The patents and applications that we license are owned by the Regents of the University of California, and Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, and relate to the basic speech and sound modification and adaptive technology developed at those institutions. In 2009, approximately 60% of our product booked sales was derived from selling products that use the licensed inventions. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years.  47 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Software and web site development costs We capitalize certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and amortize the costs over the estimated lives of the related products. The annual amortization is the greater of the amount computed using a the ratio that current year to date gross revenues for the product bear to the aggregate of total anticipated revenues for the product or b the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model.In 2009 we capitalized approximately $986,000 of costs relating to a new Reading Assistant product that had reached technological feasibility. In 2008 and 2007 costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility for new projects were not significan
t, and were charged to research and development expense.Software costs are amortized to cost of product revenues over the estimated useful life of the software, which is three years. Amortization was $91,000, zero and zero, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. We also capitalize web site application, infrastructure development and content development costs where a website is built for our internal needs and we do not plan to market the software externally.For the years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, we capitalized approximately $406,000 and $51,000 in web site development costs.If indicators of impairment are present, estimates of future cash flows are used to test the recoverability of the web site asset.If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. In late 2009 we determined that we needed to completely redesign our BrainSpark website and accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of $415,000. We also capitalized development costs of $21,000 for the new website. We will amortize 
these costs over a period corresponding to the estimated life of the related products when the web site is ready for use. Goodwill We recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets when we acquired the assets of Soliloquy. The cost of the acquisition was allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired, including purchased intangible assets, and the remaining amount was classified as goodwill. Goodwill arising from purchase transactions is not amortized to expense, but rather periodically assessed for impairment. The allocation of the acquisition cost to purchased intangible assets and goodwill, therefore, has a significant impact on our operating results. The allocation process involves an extensive use of estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets. We test goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. This impairment testing involves a two-step process as follows Step 1 -- We have determined that we have one reporting unit and compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the reporting units carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds the units fair value, we move on to Step 2. If the units fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary. Step 2 -- We perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non-goodwill intangible assets and liabilities. This allocation derives an implied fair value for the reporting units goodwill. We then compare the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment charge shall be recognized for the excess. Based on the annual impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2009, we determined that the carrying value of our recorded goodwill had not been impaired and no impairment charge was recorded. We will continue to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired. Conditions that indicate that goodwill may be impaired include our market capitalization declining below net book value or a sustained decline in our stock price. A significant impairment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations.  48 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. As noted above, we incurred an impairment charge of $415,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009 in respect of capitalized BrainSpark web development costs. We recorded no impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2007. Certain purchased intangible assets such as purchased technology and customer lists are amortized to cost of revenues and operating expense over time, while in-process research and development is recorded as a one-time charge on the acquisition date. The allocation of the acquisition cost to purchased intangible assets, therefore, has a significant impact on our operating results. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation We record stock-based compensation expense over the service period in connection with shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan and stock options and restricted stock awards. The compensation expense for stock-based awards includes an estimate for forfeitures and is recognized over the service period of the award on a straight-line basis. Advertising Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.Advertising expense was $172,000, $80,000 and $2,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be realized. Net Income Per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by adding common stock equivalents computed using the treasury stock method to the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, if dilutive.  49 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued The following table sets forth the computation of net income per share in thousands, except per share data  Year Ended December 31  2009 2008 2007 Net income loss 4,800 3,315 1,154 Weighted average shares used in calculation of basic net income loss per share 18,039 17,488 17,161 Effect of dilutive securities Effect of dilutive securities Employee stock options and awards 651 1,136 Weighted-average diluted common shares 18,690 17,488 18,297 Basic net income loss per share 027 019 007 Basic net income loss per share 027 019 007 Diluted net income loss per share 026 019 006 For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, 1,510,281, 3,150,180, and 923,621 options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because their effect is anti-dilutive. Subsequent events We have evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of our condensed financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In April 2008 the FASB issued ASC 350-30-50, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Asset. which amended the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other This new staff position was intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under ASC 350 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 350-30-50 became effective beginning with our first quarter of 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 2. Restructuring On January 7, 2009, we announced a series of changes intended to better align our costs and organization structure with the current economic environment and improve our profitability. These changes included a reduction in our work force of approximately 14% during the first quarter of 2009. We notified employees affected by the workforce reduction in December 2008 and January 2009.We accrued severance costs of approximately $104,000 in the year ended December 31, 2008 and $287,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2009.The costs were mainly recorded in the Research and Development and the Sales and Marketing line items in our Statement of Operations and were paid in full by June 30, 2009, as shown in the following table dollars in thousands Accrued severance costs, January 1, 2009 104 Restructuring charges 287 Cash paid 391 Accrued severance costs, December 31, 2009  50 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 2. Restructuring continued On September 1, 2009, we announced a plan to consolidate our product development and product management functions in our Oakland, California headquarters. Under this plan, we closed our Waltham, Massachusetts office and most Waltham employees left the company by the end of 2009. We notified the employees affected by the workforce reduction on September 1, 2009. Our lease on the Waltham office expires on September 30, 2011. In January 2010, we signed an agreement to sublease the property until October 2010. We acquired the Waltham office as part of our acquisition of the Reading Assistant product line in January 2008. We plan to continue to support and improve the Reading Assistant products, including the new Reading Assistant Expanded Edition that was launched in September 2009. These restructuring costs were mainly recorded under Research and Development in our Statement of Operations and are shown in the following table dollars in thousands  Employee costs Facility costs Total  Accrued at January 1, 2009 Accruals 149 226 375 Cash Paid 130 130 Accrued at December 31, 2009 19 226 245 We expect to pay the employee costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the facility costs over the remaining lease term. 3. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-Based Compensation Plans On December 31, 2009, we had four active share-based compensation plans, which are described below. In May 1999, our stockholders approved our 1999 Equity Incentive Plan. The total number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is 6,492,666.Restricted stock units awarded under this plan generally vest over four years of continuous service in annual or semi-annual installments. Option awards have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant, and generally vest based on four years of continuous service with a ten-year contractual term. In May 1999, our stockholders approved the 1999 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan. The total number of shares authorized for issuance under this plan is 250,000. In May 2002, the Board of Directors approved the 2002 CEO Stock Option Plan, which was subsequently approved by the shareholders in May 2003.The total number of shares authorized for issuance under this plan is 470,588. In May 1999 the stockholders approved the 1999 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which became effective upon the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock.The total number of shares originally authorized for issuance under the plan was 700,000.In June 2007 an additional 500,000 shares were authorized. Eligible employees may purchase common stock at 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of the applicable one-year offering period or the last day of the applicable six-month purchase period.At December 31, 2009, 306,985 shares were available for issuance under this plan.  51 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 3. Stock-Based Compensation continued Stock Based Compensation Expense We are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. Compensation Cost The following table summarizes the impact of share-based compensation in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 in thousands, except per share amounts  Year Ended December 31  2009 2008 2007 Cost of service and support revenues 151 200 216 Sales and marketing 490 685 892 Research and development 285 434 390 General and administrative 463 678 965 Total stock-based compensation expense 1,389 1,997 2,463 Valuation of Stock Option Awards The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, the estimated life of each award and estimated pre-vesting forfeitures. The fair value of these stock options was estimated assuming no expected dividends and estimates of expected life, volatility and risk-free interest rate at the time of grant. Estimated volatility is based on the historical prices of our common stock over the expected life of each option. Expected life of the options is based on our history of option exercise and cancellation activity.

Borrowing under the line of credit bears interest at a daily adjusting LIBOR rate.Borrowings under the line are subject to reporting covenants requiring the provision of financial statements to Comerica, and, as amended, financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum adjusted quick ratio of 115 and positive net worth.The agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit not to exceed $10 million. At December 31, 2009, we have an outstanding letter of credit for $206,000. There were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit at December 31, 2009 and we were in compliance with all our covenants.In February 2009 we borrowed $25 m
illion from the line of credit which we repaid in August 2009. 11. Income Taxes Substantially all income before income taxes is derived from the United States.

The valuation allowance decreased during 2009 by approximately $24 million. As of December 31, 2009, we have U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $541 million and $353 million, respectively.The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2018 through 2024 if not utilized.State net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2012 through 2017. As of December 31, 2009, we have U.S. federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $16 million and $13 million, respectively.The federal credit will expire at various dates beginning in 2011 through 2028, if not utilized.California state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely.  58 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 11. Income Taxes continued During 2008, we recorded an income tax expense of $12 million. This expense primarily consisted of a $12 million increase in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This valuation allowance increase was the result of recording a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. After considering all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income, we concluded that we could no longer support a deferred tax asset balance. We intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In connection with our adoption of ASC 718, we use the with-and-without approach described in ASC 740-20-05 Intraperiod Tax Allocation of the Tax Effect of Pretax Income from Continuing Operations to determine the recognition and measurement of excess tax benefits.In addition, we have elected to account for indirect effects of stock option based awards on other tax attributes, such as research and alternative minimum tax credits, through the income statement.Accordingly, we have elected to recognize excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us. Therefore, included in the net operating loss carryforwards are losses created by the exercise of stock options.Although these net operating loss carryforwards are reflected in total U.S. net operating tax loss carryforwards, pursuant to ASC 718, deferred tax assets associated with these deductions are only recognized to the extent that they reduce taxes payable.Further, these recognized deductions are treated as direct increases to stockholders' equity and as a result do not impact the Statement of Operations.To the extent stock-option related deductions are not recognized pursuant to ASC 718, the unrecognized benefit is not reflected on the Balance Sheet. Net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards reflected above are limited due to ownership changes as provided in the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. We apply the provisions of FASB Interpretation ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB ASC 740-10. ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. There was not a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as a result of the adoption of the provisions of ASC 740-10. At December31, 2009, we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $20 millionof which $18,000, if recognized, would affect the Companys effective tax rate.We believe there may be
changes in our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months, but that this will not result in a material adjustment. Interest and penalty costs related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as a component of Income Tax Expense in the accompanying statement of operations and the corresponding liability in Accrued Liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. We recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2009. We file U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Tax returns remain open to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for tax years 2004 to 2008. The federal, and state, taxing authorities may choose to audit tax returns for tax years beyond the statue of limitation period due to significant tax attribute carryforwards from prior years, making adjustments only to carryforward attributes. We are not currently under audit in any major tax jurisdiction.  59 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 11.

Inventories Inventories of $495,000 and $236,000 at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and consist entirely of finished goods. 14.Commitments and Contingencies Leases We have a non-cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities in Oakland.The minimum lease payment was approximately $78,000 per month through 2008. From 2009 through the end of the lease, the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 5%. The lease expires in December 2013.We also have a lease agreement for our Tucson, Arizona office through May 2013 at an average rent of approximately $11,000 per month.In early 2008, we entered into a lease for our Reading Assistant operations in Waltham, Massachusetts for approximately 6,000 square feet at an average monthly rent of approximately $12,000 that expires in September 2011.Following the closure of the Waltham off
ice in December 2009, we signed an agreement to sublease this property until October 2010 at a monthly rent of approximately $5,000. The Oakland lease contains two options to extend the term of the lease, the first for a period of five years from the end of the initial lease term, and the second for a period of five years from the expiration of the first extension period.The Tucson lease contains an option to extend the lease for a period of two years from the expiration of the initial term.The Waltham lease contains escalation clauses in respect of real estate taxes and operating costs. We account for rent expense on a straight line basis.  60 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 14. Commitments and Contingencies continued Future minimum payments under these leases as of December 31, 2009 are as follows in thousands 2010 1,259 2011 1,323 2012 1,274 2013 1,242  5,098 Rent expense under all operating leases was $13 million, $12 million and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. License Agreement In September 1996, we entered into a license agreement with a university for the use of the intellectual property underlying its most significant current products.In exchange for the license, which expires in 2014, we issued stock and paid a license-issue fee.The agreement also provided for milestone payments, all of which have been made, and for royalties based on booked sales of products using the licensed technology.Royalty expenses were $836,000, $757,000 and $10 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are included in cost of product revenues.Annual minimum guaranteed royalty payments are $150,000. If we lose or are unable to maintain the license agreement during the term of the underlying patents, it would adversely affect our business. The university may terminate the license agreement if we fail to perform or violate its terms without curing the violation within 60 days of receiving written notice of the violation. 15. Warranties; Indemnification We generally provide a warranty that our software products substantially operate as described in the manuals and guides that accompany the software for a period of 90 days.The warranty does not apply in the event of misuse, accident, and certain other circumstances.To date, we have not incurred any material costs associated with these warranties and have no accrual for such items at December 31, 2009. From time to time, we enter into contracts that require us, upon the occurrence of certain contingencies, to indemnify parties against third party claims.These contingent obligations primarily relate to i claims against our customers for violation of third party intellectual property rights caused by our products; ii claims resulting from personal injury or property damage resulting from our activities or products; iii claims by our office lessors arising out of our use of the premises; and iv agreements with our officers and directors under which we may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their activities on our behalf.Because the obligated amounts for these types of agreements usually are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of theseobligations cannot be reasonably estimated.No liabilities have been recorded for these obligations on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. 16. Employee Retirement and Benefit Plan We have a defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers substantially all employees. Eligible employees may contribute amounts to the plan, via payroll withholding, subject to certain limitations. In 2007 we started to match contributions by plan participants at a rate of 3% of salary, with an annual maximum of $2,000 per participant.For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 our matching contributions were $393,000 and $280,000, respectively.We decided to discontinue the matching contributions in 2009.  61 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 17. Related Party Transactions On September 30, 2003, we entered into an agreement with Posit Science Corporation Posit Science, formerly Neuroscience Solutions Corporation, to provide Posit Science with exclusive rights in the healthcare field to certain intellectual property, patents and software we own or license, along with transfer of certain healthcare research projects.A co-founder, substantial shareholder, and former member of our Board of Directors is a co-founder, officer, director and substantial shareholder of Posit Science. Under the agreement, we will receive net royalties between 2% to 4% on products sold by Posit Science that use our patents or software. We have a 35% equity interest in Posit Science. We recorded royalty income from Posit Science of $154,000, $150,000 and $246,000 in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In July 2007 Michael A. Moses joined our Board of Directors as Vice Chair and also entered into a consulting agreement with us.The consulting agreement provides for a consulting fee of $40,000 per year and two stock option grants, both with a five year term and at a per share exercise price of $715, the closing price of the Companys Common Stock on July 25, 2007. The first option grant for 80,000 shares vests over four years, with a one year cliff with ratable monthly vesting thereafter. The second option for 100,000 shares vests only in the event the per share price of the Companys common stock reaches and maintains for 20 consecutive business days a specified target closing price as follows: 25,000 shares vesting at each target stock price of $15, $20, $25, and $30. We also have in place consulting agreements with two of our founders, who are or were also members of our Board of Directors.Dr. Paula Tallal, who is a current Board member, provides ongoing consulting in the areas of customer relationships and research planning and in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 received total compensation of approximately $69,000, $111,000, and $107,000, respectively.Dr. Michael Merzenich, who retired as a Board member in October 2008, provides consulting services including public speaking, meetings with third parties and other projects as agreed from time to time, and in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 received total compensation of approximately $45,000, $28,000, and $21,000, respectively.  62 Table of Contents Notes to Financial Statements 18.

Item 5.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods. These procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required under Rule 13a-15b of the Exchange Act, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2009. It should be noted that a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. As a result, there can be no assurance that a control system will succeed in preventing all possible instances of error and fraud.Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the conclusions of our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer are made at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. This annual report does not include an audit report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to audit by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.
