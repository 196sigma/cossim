INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Sapient Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sapient
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1998. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sapient
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 NATURE OF BUSINESS
Sapient Corporation Sapient or the Company is an innovative provider
of integrated management consulting services, Internet commerce solutions and
systems implementation services. Using a proven, fixed-price model designed to
ensure on-budget and on-time delivery, Sapient offers a variety of integrated
services to help clients rapidly achieve their critical business objectives.
Founded in 1991 as a Delaware corporation, Sapient has experienced consistent
revenue growth in each of the last eight years. The Company currently has more
than 1,400 employees in offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts, New York, San
Francisco, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Portland Maine and London,
England.
On August 25, 1998 Sapient acquired Studio Archetype, Inc. Studio
Archetype for approximately $253 million in stock and cash, including direct
acquisition costs of approximately $23 million, pursuant to which Sapient
issued 498,314 shares of Common Stock and paid $250,000 in cash to the former
Studio stockholders. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and
accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values.
On December 15, 1997, Sapient acquired all of the outstanding common stock
of EXOR Technologies, Inc. EXOR in exchange for 611,738 shares of Sapient
Common Stock see Note 13. Sapient Consolidated Financial Statements have
been restated for all periods presented to reflect the acquisition of EXOR,
which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.
2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Sapient
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
b Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less are considered cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalent balances consist
of deposits and repurchase agreements with a large U.S. commercial bank and tax
exempt short-term municipal bonds.
c Short-term Investments
Short-term investments are available-for-sale securities, which are
recorded at fair market value. The difference between fair market value and cost
is not material. Realized gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale
securities were not material for any period presented.
d Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight
line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
lease term.
e Revenue Recognition
Revenues pursuant to fixed-fee contracts are generally recognized as
services are rendered on the percentage-of-completion method of accounting
based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. Revenues
pursuant to time and material contracts are generally recognized as services are
provided. Revenues from maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the
terms of the agreements.
28
31
SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a
contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses
are determined. Unbilled revenues on contracts are comprised of costs, plus
earnings on certain contracts in excess of contractual billings on such
contracts. Billings in excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred
revenues.
f Income Taxes
Sapient records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases, operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date.
g Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject Sapient to a concentration
of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
Sapient performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
does not require collateral on accounts receivable. Sapient maintains allowances
for potential credit losses and such losses have been within management
expectations. Write-offs of accounts receivable have not been material for any
of the periods presented.
The fair market values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable
and debt instruments at both December 31, 1998 and 1997 approximate their
carrying amounts.
h Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
i Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be Disposed of , the carrying value of intangible assets and other long-lived
assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or
circumstances, both internally and externally, that may suggest impairment. To
date, no such impairment has been indicated. Should there be an impairment in
the future, Sapient will measure the amount of the impairment based on
undiscounted expected future cash flows from the impaired assets. The cash flow
estimates that will be used will contain management best estimates, using
appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time.
j Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as
incurred. To date, substantially all research and development activities of
Sapient have been pursuant to customer contracts and, accordingly, have been
expensed as project costs. Sapient has not capitalized any software development
costs since such costs have neither been significant nor can the future economic
benefit be reasonably determined.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
k Stock-Based Compensation
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 SFAS 123 requires
that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock, stock
options, and other equity instruments based on fair value, or provide pro forma
disclosure of net income and net income per share in the notes to the financial
statements. Sapient applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized
under SFAS 123 for Sapient stock option plans, and footnote disclosure is
provided in Note 8.
l Earnings Per Share
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Sapient presents
both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. Basic net
income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the per share effect of
dilutive stock options and other dilutive common stock equivalents.
On January 29, 1998 the Company declared a two-for-one stock split effected
as a 100 percent stock dividend distributed on March 9, 1998, to all
shareholders of record on February 20, 1998.
m Comprehensive Income
During 1998, Sapient adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130 establishes
standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in the body of
the financial statements. Comprehensive income includes net income as currently
reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and also considers the
effect of additional economic events that are not required to be recorded in
determining net income but are rather reported as a separate component of
stockholders' equity. Sapient reports foreign currency translation gains and
losses as a component of comprehensive income.
n Segment Reporting
During 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 uses a management approach to report
financial and descriptive information about a company operating segments.
Operating segments are revenue-producing components of the enterprise for which
separate financial information is produced internally for management. Under this
definition, Sapient operated as a single segment for all years presented. The
adoption of SFAS 131 did not have a material impact on Sapient financial
condition or results of operations.
o Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles
Goodwill and other purchased intangibles represent the excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. Goodwill and
substantially all other purchased intangibles are being amortized on a straight-
line basis over lives ranging from five to seven years.
p Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In March, 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, issued SOP 98-1, Accounting
for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP
98-1 which requires the capitalization of certain internal costs related to
the implementation of computer software obtained for internal use. Sapient is
required to adopt this standard
30
33
SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
in the first quarter of 1999. It is expected that the adoption of SOP 98-1 will
not have a material impact on Sapient financial position or its results of
operations.
In June, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
133. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities.
SFAS 133 requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and the measurement of those
instruments at fair value. Sapient is required to adopt this standard in the
first quarter of 2000. It is expected that the adoption of SFAS 133 will not
have a material impact on Sapient financial position or its results of
operations.

deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Due to the fact that Sapient
has sufficient taxable income in the federal carryback period and anticipates
sufficient future taxable

7 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Sapient maintains its executive office in Massachusetts and operating
offices in several locations throughout the United States and abroad. Sapient
also leases office equipment under various operating leases. Future minimum
rental commitments under all noncancelable operating leases with initial or
remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows at December 31, 1998:

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was
approximately $8,843,000, $3,996,000, and $3,144,000, respectively.
Sapient has issued letters of credit with a bank in the aggregate amount of
$975,000 as security deposits for certain of its lease commitments.
Sapient has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary
course of its business activities. Sapient accrues contingent liabilities when
it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can
be reasonably estimated.
Sapient is in arbitration with a former employee who alleges breach of
certain contractual and other violations resulting from his termination as an
employee. Management denies that it breached any obligations or duties to this
former employee, and believes that Sapient has meritorious defenses. Sapient is
vigorously contesting these claims. Although Sapient does not expect the claims
to have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or
financial condition, an adverse judgment or settlement could have a material
adverse effect on the operating results reported by Sapient for the period in
which any such adverse judgment or settlement occurs.

8 STOCK PLANS
a 1992 Stock Option Plan
During 1992, Sapient approved the 1992 Stock Plan the 1992 Plan for its
employees. The 1992 Plan provided for the Board of Directors to grant stock
options, stock purchase authorizations and stock bonus awards up to an aggregate
of 5,000,000 shares of non-voting Common Stock. Since consummation of its
initial public offering of Common Stock in April 1996, no further grants or
awards may be made pursuant to the 1992 Stock Plan but previously outstanding
awards remain outstanding but are exercisable for voting Common Stock.
Most stock options granted under the 1992 Plan qualify as Incentive Stock
Options ISO under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The price at
which shares may be purchased with an option was specified by the Board at the
date the option was granted, but in the case of an ISO, was not less than the
fair market value of Sapient Common Stock on the date of grant. The duration
of any option was specified by the Board, but no option designated as an ISO can
be exercised beyond ten years from the date of grant. Stock options granted
under the 1992 Plan generally become exercisable over a four-year period, are
nontransferable, and expire six years after the date of grant subject to
earlier termination in the event of the termination of the optionee employment
or other relationship with Sapient.
b 1996 Equity Stock Incentive Plan
Sapient 1996 Equity Stock Incentive Plan the 1996 Plan authorizes the
Company to grant options to purchase Common Stock, to make awards of restricted
Common Stock, and to issue certain other equity-related awards to employees and
directors of, and consultants to, Sapient. The total number of shares of Common
Stock which may be issued under the 1996 Plan is 4,800,000 shares. The 1996 Plan
is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which
selects the persons to whom stock options and other awards are granted and
determines the number of shares, the exercise or purchase prices, the vesting
terms and the expiration dates of options granted. Non-qualified stock options
may be granted at exercise prices which are above, equal to or below the grant
date fair market value of the Common Stock. The exercise price of options
qualifying as Incentive Stock Options may not be less than the grant date fair
market value of the Common Stock. Stock options granted under the 1996 Plan are
nontransferable, generally become exercisable over a four-year period and expire
ten years after the date of grant subject to earlier termination in the event
of the termination of the optionee employment or other relationship with
Sapient.
c Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Sapient 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan
authorizes the issuance of up to 660,000 shares of Common Stock to participating
employees through a series of semi-annual offerings. The maximum number of
shares available in each offering is 50,000 shares plus any unpurchased shares
available from previous offerings for the first six offerings, and 60,000
shares plus any unpurchased shares available from previous offerings for the
next six offerings. An employee becomes eligible to participate in the Purchase
Plan when he or she is regularly employed by Sapient for at least 20 hours a
week and for more than five months in a calendar year on the first day of the
applicable offering. The price at which employees may purchase Common Stock in
an offering is 85 percent of the closing price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq
National Market on the day the offering commences or on the day the offering
terminates, whichever is lower. Approximately 61 percent of eligible employees
participated in the two offerings under the Purchase Plan during the year ended
December 31, 1998. Approximately 57 percent of eligible employees participated
in the two offerings under the Purchase Plan during the year ended December 31,
1997. Approximately 70 percent of eligible employees participated in the first
offering under the Purchase Plan, which terminated on December 31, 1996. Under
the Purchase Plan, Sapient sold 105,634, 93,628 and 33,830 shares of Common
Stock in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

d 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan
Sapient 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan the Directors Plan
authorizes the issuance of 60,000 shares of Common Stock. Each non-employee
director elected to the Board of Directors after the adoption of the Directors
Plan will, upon his or her election, automatically be granted an option to
purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the grant
date fair market value of Sapient Common Stock. Options granted pursuant to
the Directors Plan vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the
first anniversary of the date of grant and generally expire ten years after the
date of grant. As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, no options had been granted
under the Directors Plan.
e 1998 Stock Incentive Plan
Sapient 1998 Equity Stock Incentive Plan the 1998 Plan authorizes
Sapient to grant options to purchase Common Stock, to make awards of restricted
Common Stock, and to issue certain other equity-related awards to employees and
directors of, and consultants to, Sapient. The total number of shares of Common
Stock which may be issued under the 1998 Plan is 2,000,000 shares. The 1998 Plan
is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which
selects the persons to whom stock options and other awards are granted and
determines the number of shares, the exercise or purchase prices, the vesting
terms and the expiration date. Non-qualified stock options may be granted at
exercise prices which are above, equal to or below the grant date fair market
value of the Common Stock. The exercise price of options qualifying as Incentive
Stock Options may not be less than the grant date fair market value of the
Common Stock. Stock options granted under the 1998 Plan are nontransferable,
generally become exercisable over a four-year period and expire ten years after
the date of grant subject to earlier termination in the event of the
termination of the optionee employment or other relationship with Sapient. As
of December 31, 1998, no options had been granted under the 1998 Plan.

Sapient has five stock-based compensation plans, which are described above.
Sapient applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
plans. No compensation has been recognized relative to grants under these plans.
Had compensation cost for the awards under those plans been determined based on
the grant date fair values for awards under those plans consistent with the
method required under SFAS 123, Sapient net income and net income per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: dividend yield
of 00 percent for each year, expected volatility of 00 percent for the 1992
Plan options and 1368, 648 and 1049 percent in 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively, for the 1996 Plan options, risk free interest rates ranging from
50 to 525 percent for the 1992 Plan options and 50 to 57 percent for the
1996 Plan options, and expected lives of 4 years for the 1992 Plan and the 1996
Plan options.
Pro-forma compensation cost related to the Purchase Plan is recognized for
the fair value of the employees' purchase rights, which was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for the years ended December

1368, 648 and 675 percent, respectively, risk free interest rate ranging from
57 to 50 percent and expected life of 6 months.

in the authorized number of shares of voting Common Stock to 30,000,000 and
non-voting Common Stock to 10,000,000 and provided that, upon the closing of an
IPO, all shares of non-voting Common Stock then outstanding would be converted
automatically into an equal number of shares of voting Common Stock and the
authorized capitalization of Sapient will consist of 40,000,000 shares of Common
Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
At Sapient Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 8, 1998, the

13 ACQUISITIONS
On August 25, 1998 the Company acquired Studio Archetype for approximately
$253 million in stock and cash, including direct acquisition costs of
approximately $23 million, pursuant to which the Company issued 498,314 shares
of Sapient Common Stock and paid $250,000 in cash to the former Studio
stockholders. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly,
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their respective fair values.
In connection with the acquisition of Studio Archetype in the third quarter
of 1998, Sapient allocated $111 million to in-process technology and recorded a
corresponding income tax benefit of $42 million. This allocation represents the
estimated fair value of such technology based on risk-adjusted cash flows
related to the development of projects that had not reached technological
feasibility at the time of the acquisition and with respect to which the
in-process research and development had no alternative future uses. Accordingly,
these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date.
Sapient allocated values to the in-process research and development
projects by identifying significant research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established, including development, engineering and
testing activities associated with the introduction of Studio Archetype
next-generation enterprise-wide suite of development, scheduling, bug tracking
and content management applications. The integrated solution will be a
comprehensive enterprise scale system, allowing developers and clients to access
prototypes and trial deliverables. It will fully integrate user interface tools
with client server, advanced database and legacy systems.
The value assigned to purchased in-process technology was determined by
estimating the costs to develop the purchased in-process technology into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the
projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue
projection used to value the in-process research and development is based on
estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in
technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by
Studio Archetype and its competitors. The estimated revenues for the projects
are expected to be realized over a six year period through 2004 when other new
products are expected to enter the market. Studio Archetype projected revenues
are dependent upon successful introduction of the in-process projects.
The nature of the efforts to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially viable products and services principally relate to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification, and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the proposed technologies meet
their design specifications including functional, technical, and economic
performance requirements. The efforts to develop the purchased in-process
technology also include testing of the technology for compatibility and
interoperability with other applications. Expenditures on these projects to date
have been approximately $25 million, and estimated costs to complete these
projects are expected to total approximately $625,000 through 2001. These
estimates are subject to change, given the uncertainties of the development
process, and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will
not occur. Several milestones have been or are near completion including a
comprehensive needs analysis mapping data, technical and information
architectures and building an integrated prototype.
The rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value
are based on venture capital rates of return. Due to the nature of the forecast
and the risks associated with the projected growth, profitability and
developmental projects, discount rates of 250 to 300 percent were utilized for
the business enterprise and for the in-process research and development. Sapient
believes that these discount rates are commensurate with Studio stage of
development, the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above, the
inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased
in-process technology, the useful life of such technology, the profitability
levels of such technology, and, the uncertainty of technological advances that
are unknown at this time.

SAPIENT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
The forecasts used by Sapient in valuing in-process research and
development were based upon assumptions that the Company believes to be
reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Sapient
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and
circumstances are likely to occur. For these reasons, actual results may vary
materially from the assumed results and could have a material adverse effect on
Sapient business, results of operations and financial condition.
Sapient believes that the assumptions used in the forecasts were
reasonable. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions
used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or
the events associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. For these
reasons, actual results may vary from the assumed results and could have a
material adverse effect on Sapient business, results of operations and
financial condition.
Sapient expects to continue its support of these efforts and believes
Studio Archetype has a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research
and development programs. However, there is risk associated with the completion
of the projects and there is no assurance that any of the projects will meet
with either technological or commercial success.
If these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and
profitability of Studio Archetype may be adversely affected in future periods.
Additionally, the value of the other intangible assets acquired may become
impaired. Studio expects to benefit from the purchased in-process technology
beginning in 1999.
Other intangible assets of $144 million is comprised of $38 million for
marketing assets, $16 million for assembled work force and approximately $90
million of goodwill comprising the reputation of Studio Archetype, all of which
have estimated useful lives of approximately 7 years. However there are no
assurances that the value of these intangible assets acquired will not become
impaired.
Below are the pro forma results of operations for Sapient and Studio
Archetype, assuming that the acquisition of Studio occurred at the beginning of
the twelve-month period ended December 31, 1997.                              1998     1997

On December 15, 1997, Sapient issued 611,738 shares of Sapient Common Stock
for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of EXOR, a provider of ERP
implementation services using Oracle applications. This business combination has
been accounted for as a pooling of interests and, accordingly, the Consolidated
Financial Statements for the periods prior to the combination have been restated
to include the accounts and results of operations of EXOR.
14 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has provided technology services to certain start-up companies.
As partial payment for services delivered, Sapient has received non-controlling
equity interests in such start-up companies. Due to the start-up nature of these
entities, Sapient has valued these investments at zero as there is no readily
determinable measure of value based on the underlying operating performance and
future cash flows of the start-up companies. During 1998 Sapient recognized
approximately $2,200,000 in net revenues from consulting services provided to
these companies. In addition, certain members of management of the Company have
provided funding to certain of these companies.
