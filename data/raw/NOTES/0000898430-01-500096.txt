NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2000
Note 1--Nature of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
In December 1999, Reading Entertainment Inc., a Delaware corporation, was
merged into a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Reading Entertainment,
Inc., a Nevada corporation. The purpose of the merger was to change the
domicile of the corporation from Delaware to Nevada. The Nevada corporation
was the surviving corporation and the corporation operations, assets,
liabilities and capitalization were not changed as a result of the merger. As
used herein, the term REI refers to Nevada corporation. REI, together with
its subsidiaries and predecessors, are referred to as Reading or the
Company.
The Company is in the business of developing and operating multiplex
cinemas and entertainment centers in Australia and New Zealand. The Company
also operates cinemas in Puerto Rico, and until March 2001, in the United
States. After March 2001, the Company only domestic cinema interest was its
passive 333% membership interest in the Angelika Film Center, LLC AFC the
owner of the Angelika Film Center & Cafe located in the Soho district of
Manhattan the NY Angelika. This interest in AFC and these historic domestic
cinema operations are referred to herein as the Domestic Cinemas. Reading
current cinemas are owned and operated through Reading Cinemas of Puerto Rico,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, under the CineVista name in Puerto Rico
CineVista or the Puerto Rico Circuit; through Reading Entertainment
Australia Pty Ltd collectively with its subsidiaries referred to herein as
Reading Australia under the Reading Cinemas name in Australia the
Australia Circuit, and through a 50/50 joint venture in New Zealand under
the Berkeley Cinemas name. The Company entertainment center development
activities in Australia and New Zealand are conducted through the affiliates
of Reading Australia in Australia and through affiliates of Reading New
Zealand Ltd. collectively referred to herein as Reading New Zealand in New
Zealand. The Company operates in two business segments, cinema operations and
real estate development see Note 3.
Basis of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements of REI and
subsidiaries include the accounts of REI and its majority-owned subsidiaries,
after elimination of all significant intercompany transactions, accounts and
profits. The Company investments in 20% to 50% owned companies are accounted
for on the equity method. Investments in other companies are carried at cost.
Accounting Principles: The Company consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.
Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
Income Taxes: Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest,
which approximates fair market value, and consist principally of time
deposits, interest-bearing bank deposits, federal agency securities and other
short-term money market instruments.
Inventories: Inventories are comprised of confection goods used in theater
operations and are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or
net realizable value.
39              READING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Property held for development: Property held for development consists of
land including land acquisition costs acquired for the potential development
of multiplex cinemas and/or entertainment centers and held either for such
purposes or for other development purposes. Property held for development is
carried at cost and, at the time that construction of the related multiplex
cinema and/or entertainment center commences, is transferred to property and
equipment and accounted for as construction-in-progress.
Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are carried at cost.
Depreciation of buildings, leasehold improvements and equipment are recorded
on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets or,
if the assets are leased, the remaining lease term inclusive of renewal
options, if likely to be exercised, whichever is shorter. The estimated
useful lives are generally as follows                                  
Building and  20-40 years
3-15 years
Furniture and   3-7 years
Leasehold  10-20 years  Construction-in-Progress and Property Development Costs: Construction-in-
progress and property development costs are comprised of direct costs
associated with the development of potential cinemas whether for purchase or
lease or entertainment center locations. Startup costs and other costs not
directly related to the acquisition of long term assets are expensed as
incurred. Amounts are carried at cost unless management decides that a
particular location will not be pursued to completion or if the costs are no
longer relevant to the proposed project. If such a judgment is made,
previously capitalized costs which are no longer of value are expensed.
Included in the Statement of Operations as General and administrative
expenses are such development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000,
1999, and 1998 amounting to approximately $1,462,000, $682,000 and $545,000.
Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are comprised of acquired beneficial
cinema leases used in CineVista operations, and the cost in excess of net
assets acquired in the acquisition of certain domestic cinema assets.
The amount of the CineVista purchase price ascribed to the beneficial
leases was determined by an independent appraiser computing the present value
of the excess of market rental rates over the rental rates in effect under
CineVista leases at the time of the Company acquisition of CineVista and
allocating such amount as a component of the purchase price of CineVista. The
beneficial leases were amortized on the straight-line basis over a period of
195 years. The remaining beneficial leases were written off in 1999 in
conjunction with asset impairment charges recorded in 1999 see Note 5.
The amount of the purchase price of the NY Angelika assets in excess of the
appraised fair value of the assets acquired, as determined by an independent
appraiser, was being amortized on the straight-line basis over a period of 20
years. Following the sale of a 50% membership interest of the NY Angelika to
National Auto Credit Inc. NAC in April 2000 see Notes 2 and 4.
The purchase price of St. Anthony Main, another domestic cinema in
Minnesota, was being amortized on the straight-line basis over the remaining
life of the lease term which approximates four years. The remaining beneficial
lease of approximately $90,000 was written off in December 2000 in conjunction
with asset impairment charges recorded in 2000 see Note 5. The Company has
no excess costs at December 31, 2000. The St. Anthony Main was sold in March
2001 see Note 19.
Advertising Costs: The Company expenses the costs of advertising as
incurred. Advertising expense was $1,816,000, $1,518,000 and $1,005,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
40              READING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Impairment of Long Lived Assets: The Company reviews long-lived assets,
including intangibles, for impairment if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.
If the sum of the estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without
interest charges, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment
loss is recognized on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset
exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of assets is determined as
either the expected selling price less selling costs or the present value of
the estimated future cash flows see Note 5.
Translation of Non-U.S. Currency Amounts: The financial statements and
transactions of Reading Australia and Reading New Zealand cinema and real
estate operations are maintained in their functional currency Australian and
New Zealand dollars, respectively and translated into U.S. dollars in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52,
Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities of such operations are
denominated in their functional currency and translated at exchange rates in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the
average exchange rate for the period. Translation adjustments are reported as
Accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of Shareholders equity.
The carrying value of Reading Australia and Reading New Zealand assets
will fluctuate due to changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and
the Australian dollar $05560 and $06543 were the respective exchange rates
of U.S. dollars per Australian dollar at December 31, 2000 and 1999 and the
U.S. dollar and the New Zealand dollar $04423 and $05215 were the
respective exchange rates of U.S. dollar per New Zealand dollar at December
31, 2000 and 1999. In the accompanying financial statements, balance sheet
accounts are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect on
the reporting date, and operating results are translated into U.S. dollars at
the average of the exchange rates in effect during each period reported.
Loss Per Share: Net loss applicable to common stock shareholders reflects
the reduction for dividends declared or accumulated on the Company Series A
Voting Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock the Series A
Preferred Stock, and Series B Voting Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock
the Series B Preferred Stock collectively, the Convertible Preferred
Stock and for amortization of the value of an estimate of an asset put
option the Asset Put Option. The Asset Put Option was fully amortized in
2000 when the Asset Put Option expired unused see Note 15.
Basic loss per share on the REI common stock the Common Stock is
calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
periods presented. The weighted average number of shares used in the
computation of basic loss per share were 7,449,364 in each of the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999, and 1998. Diluted loss per share is calculated by
dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the
period plus the dilutive effect of stock options, convertible securities and
the Asset Put Option. During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company
recorded a net loss and therefore, the effect of these stock options was anti-
dilutive. Stock options to purchase 530,232, 652,232 and 617,232 shares of
common stock were outstanding during 2000, 1999 and 1998 at a weighted average
exercise price of $1278, $1337 and $1337 per share, respectively. In
addition, the Asset Put Option had expired in 2000 and was not included in the
calculation of the diluted loss per share for the year ended December 31,
2000.
Stock-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB 25 and complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Finan-
cial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 123. Under APB 25, compensation cost is recognized over the vesting
period based on the difference, if any, on the date of grant between the fair
value of the Company stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire
the stock See Note 11.
41              READING ENTERTAINMENT, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In March 2000, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44.
Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation-an
Interpretation of APB No. 25. FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB 25 for
certain issues including: 1 the definition of employee for purposes of
applying APB 25, 2 the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as
a non-compensatory plan, 3 the accounting consequence of various
modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and
4 the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. FIN 44 was effective July 1, 2000, except for the provisions that
relate to modifications that directly or indirectly reduce the exercise price
of an award and the definition of an employee, which were effective after
December 15, 1998. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on
the Company financial position or results of operations.
New Accounting Pronouncements: In December 1999, the Securities and
Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB
101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 101 provides guidance
on applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition
issues in financial statements. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a

of such personnel are allocated between the three companies on an appropriate
basis, taking into account the amount of time spent by such personnel on the
business and affairs of the three companies. In 1999, prior to such a
management agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company determined it
appropriate to reimburse Craig Corp $580,000 following a review of the time
spent by Messrs. Cotter, Tompkins and certain administrative employees of
Craig for the benefit of the Company. These allocations are reviewed and
approved periodically by the outside directors of the three companies.
There was no similar reimbursement with respect to 1998. In each of the
three years ended December 31, 2000, Mr. Cotter received directly from the
Company $150,000 per annum for his services as the Chairman of the Board of

services provided to the Company. With the implementation of the management
agreement structure, the Company will no longer be separately paying Citadel
for real estate consulting services.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued BRI and the Agricultural Partnerships
The Agricultural Partnerships use Farming to farm their properties. Farming
receives, in consideration of its services, reimbursement of its costs plus 5%
of the net revenues of the farming operations after picking, packing and
hauling. Farming, in turn, contracts with Cecelia for certain bookkeeping and
administrative services, for which it pays a fee of $6,000 per month. Cecelia
also packs fruit for the Agricultural Partnerships. The acquisition of the
properties owned by the Agricultural Partnerships was financed by a ten-year
purchase money mortgage in the amount of $4,050,000, a line-of-credit from
Citadel, and pro-rata contributions from the partners. In December 1998, the
Partnerships suffered a freeze which destroyed the 1998-1999 crop. The
Agricultural Partnerships had no funds to repay the line-of-credit from
Citadel, to fund the costs associated with production of a 1999-2000 crop, or
to complete the anticipated capital improvements other than to call upon the
partners for funding. BRI had no funds or resources with which to provide such
funding other than to call upon its separate line-of-credit from Citadel. That
line-of-credit has now expired. For the period from January 1999 to December
2000, Citadel and Visalia have provided the funding required by the
Agricultural Partnerships on an 80/20 basis. The management of Citadel and
Visalia currently intend to scale back farming operations until such
operations can be supported from the cash flow generated by the Big 4
Properties, while looking for a way to exit the citrus farming business. As of
December 31, 2000, Citadel and Visalia had advanced $3,909,000 and $634,000,
respectively, to the Agricultural Partnerships. The Board of Directors and
executive officers of BRI are comprised of three Craig directors, including
Margaret Cotter, James Cotter daughter and a member of Visalia.

and recorded a restructuring charge of $889,000 in 1999. The Restructuring
charge includes a provision for lease termination charges, duplicate office
and employee expenditures and employee severance obligations.
Puerto Rico
During the third quarter of 1999, the Company recorded an asset impairment
charge of $14,022,000 after CineVista wrote-off the entire carrying value of
the 8-screen cinema it operates at the Plaza Las Americas Mall the Plaza
Cinema. Prior thereto, CineVista believed it had reached an agreement with
the landlord as to the terms of the lease with respect to the opening of a new
10-screen cinema at a second location in the Plaza. However, CineVista was
advised by the landlord that the new cinema lease was awarded to a third
party, CineVista primary competitor in the Puerto Rican market. In light of
the adverse change in the Plaza Cinemas' business prospects upon the opening
of a competing state-of-the-art cinema in the same shopping mall, the Company
evaluated the recoverability of its investment in the Plaza Cinema and
determined that the entire carrying value of the Plaza Cinemas, $13,884,000
$11,838,000 in beneficial lease, $1,438,000 in leasehold improvements and
$1,009,000 in equipment, net of certain related lease liabilities of $401,000
was impaired and was written-off. Also in the third quarter of 1999, CineVista
decided to close a 4-screen leased cinema and recorded an asset impairment
charge of $138,000, the difference of the carrying value of the cinema and the
appraised value of the leasehold interest. That cinema was closed in January
2001.
During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company decided it should exit the
Puerto Rico market and therefore wrote-down the carrying value of CineVista to
its estimated net realizable value, resulting in an additional asset
impairment charge of $17,308,000. The estimated net realizable value of
CineVista was determined by computing the net present value of CineVista
estimated future cash flows. The discount rate utilized was determined based
upon an analysis of comparable sale transactions. In conjunction with the
asset impairment charge, the Company wrote-off the remaining beneficial lease 273,000, and created a $17,034,000 asset impairment reserve which is a
component of Property and equipment see Note 8.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Reading Australia and Reading New Zealand
During third and fourth quarters of 2000, the Company recorded an asset
impairment charge of approximately $3,233,000 relating to the Company
investments in Australia and New Zealand. Of this amount, approximately
$2,068,000 related to the Whitehorse Property Group and the unit trust of
which the Whitehorse Property Group is the sole trustee collectively WPG
see Note 6, $1,141,000 related to Frankston, and $24,000 related to
Takanini.
In early 2000, WPG determined to sell its shopping center and commenced
marketing the property for sale during the second quarter of 2000. Based upon
then estimates of the potential proceeds which could be expected from a sale
of the shopping center, and WPG investment in the property, the Company
wrote down its investment in WPG by approximately $1,725,000. In the third
quarter of 2000, the Company determined that the Company remaining
investment in WPG would not be recoverable, taking into account the
obligations of WPG, and the contracted sales price for the shopping center.
Accordingly, the Company reduced its investment in WPG to zero as of September
30, 2000.
Leased Equipment
In the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company was advised by the partnership
which manages the Company portfolio of leased equipment that the market for
used computer equipment had deteriorated as the global Year 2000 compliance
efforts created an overabundance of used computer equipment. In addition, a
decision by a large lessee of the Company computer equipment to upgrade
certain computer equipment, including equipment leased from the Company, is
also anticipated to have an effect upon the estimated residual value of the
portfolio. Based on discussions with computer equipment vendors, the Company
wrote-off the entire carrying value, $2,125,000, in the fourth quarter of
1999.
Note 6--Property Held for Sale
Domestic Theaters
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company determined to sell its
remaining domestic cinema assets excluding its 333% membership interest in
AFC and concurrently with this decision, wrote down the carrying value of its
four domestic cinemas 28 screens to their estimated market value see Note
5. The Company concluded the sale of the four domestic assets in question on
March 8, 2001. The sale was to Citadel at a sale price equal to the written
down value on the Company books at December 31, 2000 of $1,706,000 and was
in the form of a two year note carrying interest at 80%.
Whitehorse Property Group
Reading Australia owns a 50% interest in WPG. The ownership is structured
as a joint venture with Burstone Victoria Pty Limited Burstone which owns
the remaining 50% interest in WPG. WPG owns a shopping center located near
Melbourne, Australia the Whitehorse Center.
Reading Australia paid $1,400,000 for its interest in WPG. In addition,
Reading Australia guaranteed a 50% interest in an existing bank loan in the
principal amount of $6,120,000, incurred by WPG in connection with its
purchase of the shopping center and secured by a first mortgage on the
shopping center WPG Loan, and loaned to the principals of Burstone
approximately $1,600,000 to enable these individuals to buy out certain
minority interests in Burstone Burstone Loan. The Burstone Loan was due
and payable on November 21, 1999 and is guaranteed by Burstone and is secured
by the borrower interest in Burstone and by Burstone interest in WPG. The
Company has taken legal actions against the Burstone principals to collect
this loan which is currently in default.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  In early 2000, WPG determined to sell its shopping center and commenced
marketing the property for sale during the second quarter of 2000. Based upon
then estimates of the potential proceeds which could be expected from a sale
of the shopping center, and WPG investment in the property, the Company
wrote down its investment in WPG by approximately $1,725,000 during the three
months ended June 30, 2000.
WPG has not yet been successful in selling the shopping center due to the
refusal of Burstone to agree to sell the shopping center at the price
currently being offered by a prospective qualified purchaser. On September 28,
2000, WPG was unable to repay the WPG Loan when the same became due. In light
of the position taken by Burstone, the Company has 1 commenced an action to
recover the Burstone Loan; 2 purchased in March 2001 the WPG Loan, and 3
entered into an agreement to sell the shopping center to a potential purchaser
subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence by that potential
purchaser, and the procurement by Reading Australia of the right to sell the
shopping center over any ongoing objections by Burstone. Based upon the
contracted sales price for the shopping center, and taking into account the
obligations of WPG under the WPG Loan, management determined that the
Company remaining investment in WPG would not be recoverable. The Company
wrote off its investment in WPG amounting to $343,000 in the third quarter of
2000.
WPG net loss earnings for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and
1998 totaled approximately $478,000, $194,000 and $50,000, respectively.
Reading recognized 100% of such losses in 2000 and 1999 because it effectively
holds 100% of WPG due to its security interest in the WPG interest owned by
Burstone and in the shares of Burstone owned by the borrowers under the
Burstone Loan. These losses have been included in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 as Equity in losses
earnings of affiliates.
Royal George Theatre
In 1999, the Company determined that it would sell RGT. Accordingly 2,893,000, the Company net carrying value of RGT was classified as Property
held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 1999.
On September 22, 2000, the Company transferred to Citadel its interest in
RGT, the limited liability company formed by the Company to acquire and
operate the Royal George Theatre complex, for $3,000,000, the Company
approximate cost basis in the property, less an amount equal to the sum of 1
the long-term liabilities of RGT and 2 the difference between the short-term
assets and liabilities of RGT. The Company realized net proceeds of $1,708,000
from the sale of its interest in RGT.

stock option plans: the 1992 Non-qualified Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan,
as amended in 1997 and the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan. Each
plan was approved by shareholders in its year of adoption.
The 1992 Plan reserves 500,000 shares for grant and the 1997 Plan reserves
200,000 shares for grant. The exercise price, term and other conditions
applicable to each grant of options under the Company two plans are
generally determined at the time of grant by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors and may vary with each option grant. Generally, options
granted under both plans vest on the anniversary of the date of grant in four
equal, annual installments, have exercise prices equal to or greater than 100%
of the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant and
expire ten years from the date of grant.
Shareholders of the Company approved a grant of options on September 16,
1997 to James J. Cotter, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company
the Cotter Options. The Cotter Options are divided into three groups:
options to purchase up to 110,000 shares of Common Stock, which become
exercisable in four equal installments commencing one year from the date of
grant the Basic Options; options to purchase up to 260,000 shares of
Common Stock, which become exercisable over a similar vesting schedule, but
only in proportion to the number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
which are converted into Common Stock the Convertible Preferred Options;
and options to purchase up to 90,000 shares of Common Stock, which become
exercisable over a similar vesting schedule, but only in proportion to the
number of shares of Common Stock which are issued pursuant to the Asset Put

The weighted average remaining contractual life of all options outstanding
at December 31, 2000 was approximately 40 years.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, the
intrinsic value method, in accounting for the compensation expense of its
stock option plans. Under the intrinsic value method, no compensation expense
is recognized for stock option awards granted at or above fair market value.
Effective January 1, 1996, SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, encouraged adoption of a fair value based method for valuing
the cost of stock option grants. SFAS No. 123 allows companies to continue to
employ APB No. 25, but requires disclosure of pro forma net income and
earnings per share information reflecting the fair value approach to valuing
stock options and the corresponding increase in compensation expense in each
of the years that the company grants stock options. The Company granted
options in 1999 and no options were granted in 2000 or 1998. In computing the
pro forma effect of the grants of stock options granted in 1999, the Asset Put
Options and the Convertible Preferred Stock Options have been excluded since
the conditions precedent to the granting of such options have not occurred.
The fair value of these options was estimated at the respective dates of grant

increase the Net loss applicable to common shareholders by approximately
$32,000 $0004 per share, $164,000 $02 per share, and $258,000 $03 per
share in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. The pro forma adjustments may not
be representative of future disclosures because the estimated fair value of
stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period, and additional
options may be granted in future years. Further, SFAS 123 requires assumptions
by management regarding the likelihood of events on which the vesting of
contingent options is predicated.

loss carryforwards of $38,470,000 of which $17,862,000 are in Puerto Rico and

The Company paid $83,000, $88,000 and $192,000 in income taxes in 2000,
1999, and 1998, respectively. The Company is subject to regular federal income
tax; however, due to its net operating loss carryforwards, the Company is only
required to pay AMT. AMT is calculated separately from the regular federal
income tax and is based on a flat rate applied to a broader tax base. Amounts
payable thereunder cannot be totally eliminated through the application of net
operating loss carryforwards.
The Company 1996 tax return is under review by the Internal Revenue
Service. While the Company believes its reporting position in such period to
be reasonable and the Service has not alleged any deficiencies, no assurances
can be made that the Company tax reporting position will be upheld.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Note 13--Legal Proceedings
Certain Shareholder Litigation
In September 1996, the holder of 50 shares of common stock commenced a
purported class action on behalf of the Company minority shareholders in the
Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas relating to the 96 Reorganization
and Stock Transactions. The complaint in the action the Complaint named
REI, Craig Corp, two former directors of REI and certain of the then current
directors of REI as defendants. The Complaint alleged, among other things,
that the Independent Committee set up to review the transactions, and the
current and former directors of REI breached their fiduciary duty to the
minority shareholders in the review and negotiation of the 96 Reorganization
and Stock Transactions and that none of the directors of REI were independent
and that they all were controlled by James J. Cotter, Craig Corp or those
controlled by them. The Complaint also alleged, in part, that the defendants
failed to disclose the full future earnings potential of the Company and that
Craig Corp would benefit unjustly by having its credit rating upgraded and its
balance sheet bolstered and that the value of the minority shareholders'
interest in the Company was diluted by the transactions.
In November 1996, plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint against all of the
REI directors at that time, its two former directors and Craig Corp. The
Amended Complaint does not name REI as a defendant. The Amended Complaint
essentially restated all of the allegations contained in the Complaint and
contended that the named defendant directors and Craig Corp breached their
fiduciary duties to the alleged class. The Amended Complaint sought
unspecified damages on behalf of the alleged class and attorneys and experts'
fees. On December 9, 1997, the Court certified the case as a Class Action and
approved the plaintiff as Class Representative.
On April 24, 1997, plaintiff filed a purported derivative action against
the same defendants. This action included claims substantially similar to
those asserted in the class action and also alleged waste of tax benefits
relating to the Company historic railroad operating losses. The Company
moved to dismiss this case for failure by the plaintiff to comply with the
mandated procedures for bringing such an action. On January 23, 1998, the
Court dismissed the derivative action. The dismissal of the derivative action
does not affect the class action case, nor does it preclude reassertion to the
claims contained in the derivative action.
On September 28, 1998, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment.
In February 2000, the Court granted summary judgment against the Plaintiff and
in favor of all of the defendant directors. Craig Corp was not dismissed,
however, the Court agreed to reconsider Craig Corp motion in light of its
decision to dismiss the claims against all of the defendant directors.
Subsequently, the Court entered summary judgment in favor of Craig Corp, and
the plaintiff appealed the Court determinations with respect to all
defendants. The Company is advised that all defendants intend to defend
against the plaintiff appeal of the Court ruling.
Redevelopment Authority of the City of Philadelphia v. Reading
On December 12, 1997, the Redevelopment Authority filed an action in the
Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas which relates to the 1993 sale of the
Headhouse property by Reading to the Authority. Plaintiff has alleged
discovery of various contaminants--asbestos, PCB lead paint--and alleged
past and future clean-up costs in excess of $1,000,000. The action was settled
in 2000.
Whitehorse Center Litigation
On October 30, 2000, Reading Australia commenced litigation in the Supreme
Court of Victoria at Melbourne, Commercial and Equity Division, against its
joint venture partner and the controlling stockholders of its joint venture
partner in the Whitehorse Center. That action is entitled Reading
Entertainment Australia PTY, LTD vs. Burstone Victoria PTY, LTD and May Way
Khor and David Frederick Burr, and was brought to collect

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
on a loan made by Reading Australia to Ms. Khor and Mr. Burr, which loan was
guaranteed by Burstone Victoria PTY, LTD Burstone. The defendants have
asserted certain set-offs and counterclaims, alleging, in essence, that
Reading Australia breached certain obligations it had to build a cinema at the
Whitehorse Center, causing the defendants substantial damages. The Company
believes that it has good and sufficient defenses to the defendants assertions
and counter claims. The case is currently in the discovery stage.
Other Claims
The Company is not a party to any other pending legal proceedings or
environmental action which management believes could have a material adverse
effect on its financial position. While the City of Philadelphia has asserted
that the Company share of any environmental clean up costs related to its
North Viaduct Property would be in the range of $3,500,000, the Company does
not believe that it has any current obligation to commence such remediation
and believes such estimate to be inaccurate.

The growth in revenues during first and second quarters of 2000 as compared
with the same periods during 1999 is generally due to increased number of
screens in operation in Puerto Rico and Australia during the 2000 periods,
partially offset by the decline in revenues as a result of the deconsolidation
of AFC after April 5, 2000 and the closure of one location with 8 screens in
June 2000. In addition, first and second quarter results include the following
non-recurring transactions: 1 an exchange transaction with NAC which
resulted in the sale of a 50% interest in the AFC and the acquisition of 259%
common stock interest in NAC. This exchange transaction resulted in a gain of
approximately $4,776,000 including the deferred gain of approximately
$1,242,000; 2 a $1,725,000 and a $ 24,000 impairment loss to reflect the
uncertainty regarding the ultimate recovery of WPG and Takanini investments;
and 3 an increase in equity losses from the Company ownership of NAC, WPG
and Citadel see Note 7.
Third quarter results include the following: 1 a write off of development
costs amounting to approximately $1,142,000 upon the Company determination
that it would not proceed with development of one project in Australia; 2 an
additional $342,000 impairment write down relating to WPG assets to reduce the
carrying cost to zero; 3 insurance settlement proceeds of approximately
$949,000 received by CineVista; and 4 $500,000 of fee received from NAC
taken to income previously recorded as deferred income.
Fourth quarter results include 1 approximately $14,150,000 of proceeds
received from the sale of NAC common stock in November and December 2000 and
2 approximately $11,743,000 in impairment write down of the Company
domestic cinema circuit to its estimated market value see Note 5.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Fiscal 1999
First quarter revenues decreased from those recorded in the prior year
first quarter due to the significant contribution the Company received from
the movie Titanic in 1998 first quarter. Third quarter results include a
$14,022,000 asset impairment charge and a full quarter of operating results of
two new cinemas opened in May. Fourth quarter results include an asset
impairment charge of $20,272,000, a restructuring charge of $889,000 and an
additional allocation of expenses charged to the Company by Craig of
approximately $580,000, plus a full quarter of results of a new cinema which

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Proposed Consolidation of the Companies
On March 15, 2001, the Boards of Directors of each of REI, Craig Corp. and
CHC considered management proposal to consolidate REI, Craig Corp. and CHC
into a single public company and determined that it would be in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate such a
consolidation transaction, so long as the allocation of ownership of the
resultant consolidated entity among the equity holders of the constituent
entities was fair. However, in light of the overlapping management and
membership of the Boards of Directors of each company, and Mr. Cotter status
as a controlling stockholder of each of the three companies, it was determined
to be appropriate to delegate management proposal to the Conflicts
Committees of the three companies. Accordingly, the Boards of Directors of
each of the three companies delegated to their respective Conflict Committees
authority and responsibility to review and take such action as they determined
appropriate with respect to management consolidation proposal, and
authorized such committees to retain such professional advisors as they may
require to carry out such delegated authority. These committees are composed
entirely of independent outside directors. It is hoped that these committees
will complete their work by the end of the second quarter 2001.
