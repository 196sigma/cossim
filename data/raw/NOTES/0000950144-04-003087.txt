36 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To: Board of Directors The Ultimate Software Group,Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Ultimate Software Group,Inc. and
subsidiary the Company as of December31,
2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity deficitand cash
flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year
ended December31, 2001, were audited by other auditors who
have ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements in their
report dated February1, 2002. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of The Ultimate Software
Group,Inc. and subsidiary as of December31, 2003 and
2002 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the years then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.
NATURE OF OPERATIONS The Ultimate Software Group,Inc.
Ultimate Software or the Company
designs, markets, implements and supports payroll and workforce
management solutions, marketed primarily to middle-market
organizations with 500 to 15,000 employees. The Company reaches
its customer base and target market through its direct sales
force and a network of national, regional and local strategic
partners.   
2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiary, Ultimate
Benefits,Inc., an inactive company. Intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less when acquired are considered
cash equivalents and are comprised of interest-bearing accounts. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are principally from
end-users of the Companys products. The Company performs
credit evaluations of its customers and has recorded allowances
for estimated losses. The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to
provide adequate protection against losses resulting from
collecting less than full payment on accounts receivables. A
considerable amount of judgment is required when the realization
of receivables is assessed, including assessing the probability
of collection and current credit-worthiness of each customer. If
the financial condition of the Companys customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be
required. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of
accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and
equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to
five years. Leasehold improvements and assets under capital
leases are amortized over the shorter of the life of the asset
or the term of the lease over periods ranging from two to
fifteen years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
when incurred; betterments are capitalized. Upon the sale or
retirement of assets, the cost, accumulated depreciation and
amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss
is recognized. Revenue Recognition Sources of revenue for the Company include   
Sales of perpetual licenses for UltiPro Workforce
Management Software UltiPro, a Web-based solution
designed to deliver the functionality businesses need to manage
the employee life cycle, whether their processes are centralized
at headquarters or distributed across multiple divisions or
branch offices;
Sales of perpetual licenses for UltiPro in
conjunction with services to host the UltiPro application
Hosting Services;
Sales of the right to use UltiPro, including
Hosting Services the Intersourcing Offering;
43 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Sales of Hosting Services on a stand-alone basis
to customers who already own a perpetual license or are
simultaneously acquiring a perpetual license for UltiPro
Base Hosting;
Sales of other services including implementation,
training and other services, including the provision of
payroll-related forms and the printing of FormW-2s
for certain customers, as well as services provided to Ceridian
Corporation Ceridian pursuant to the Ceridian
Services Agreement defined below;and
Recurring revenues derived from
1maintenance revenues generated from maintaining,
supporting and providing periodic updates for the Companys
software and 2subscription revenues generated from per
employee per month PEPM fees earned through the
Intersourcing Offering, Base Hosting and the business service
provider BSPsales channel, as well as
revenues generated from the Ceridian Agreement defined below.
Perpetual Licenses for UltiPro Sold With or
Without Hosting Services Sales of perpetual licenses for UltiPro and sales
of perpetual licenses for UltiPro in conjunction with Hosting
Services are multiple-element arrangements that involve the sale
of software and consequently fall under the guidance of
SOP97-2 for revenue recognition. The Company licenses software under
non-cancelable license agreements and provides services
including maintenance, training and implementation consulting
services. In accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, license revenues are generally recognized
when 1a non-cancelable license agreement has been signed
by both parties, 2the product has been shipped,
3no significant vendor obligations remain and
4collection of the related receivable is considered
probable. To the extent any one of these four criteria is not
satisfied, license revenue is deferred and not recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations until all such criteria are
met. For multiple-element software arrangements, each
element of the arrangement is analyzed and the Company allocates
a portion of the total fee under the arrangement to the elements
based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value of the
element VSOE, regardless of any separate prices
stated within the contract for each element. Fair value is
considered the price a customer would be required to pay when
the element is sold separately. The residual method is used to recognize revenue
when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be
delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective
evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists.
The fair value of the undelivered elements is determined based
on the historical evidence of stand-alone sales of these
elements to third parties. Undelivered elements in a license
arrangement typically include maintenance, training and
implementation services the Standard Undelivered
Elements. The fair value for maintenance fees is based on
the price of the services sold separately, which is determined
by the annual renewal rate historically and consistently charged
to customers. Maintenance fees are generally priced as a
percentage of the related license fee. The fair value for
training services is based on standard pricing i.e., rate per
training day charged to customers for class attendance, taking
into consideration stand-alone sales of training services
through year-end seminars and historically consistent pricing
for such services the Training Valuation. The fair
value for implementation services is based on standard pricing
i.e., rate per hour charged to customers for implementation
services, taking into consideration stand-alone sales of
implementation services through special projects and
historically consistent pricing for such services the
Implementation Valuation. Under the residual method
the Residual Method, the fair value of the
undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of
the arrangement fee attributable to the delivered element, the
license fee, is recognized as revenue. If VSOE for one or more
undelivered elements does not exist, the 44 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued revenue is deferred on the entire arrangement
until the earlier of the point at which isuch VSOE does
exist or iiall elements of the arrangement have been
delivered. Perpetual licenses of UltiPro sold without
Hosting Services typically include a license fee and the
Standard Undelivered Elements. Fair value for the Standard
Undelivered Elements is based on the Maintenance Valuation, the
Training Valuation and the Implementation Valuation. The
delivered element of the arrangement, the license fee, is
accounted for in accordance with the Residual Method. Perpetual licenses of UltiPro sold with Hosting
Services typically include a license fee, the Standard
Undelivered Elements and Hosting Services. Fair value for the
Standard Undelivered Elements is based on the Maintenance
Valuation, the Training Valuation and the Implementation
Valuation. Hosting Services are delivered to customers on a PEPM
basis over the term of the related customer contract
Hosting PEPM Services. Upfront fees charged to
customers represent fees for the hosting infrastructure,
including hardware costs, third-party license fees and other
upfront costs incurred by the Company in relation to providing
such services Hosting Upfront Fees. Hosting PEPM
Services and Hosting Upfront Fees collectively, Hosting
Services represent undelivered elements in the
arrangement since their delivery is over the course of the
related contract term. The fair value for Hosting Services is
based on standard pricing i.e., rate charged per employee per
month, taking into consideration stand-alone sales of Hosting
Services through the sale of such services to existing customers
i.e., those who already own the UltiPro perpetual license at
the time Hosting Services are sold to them and historically
consistent pricing for such services the Hosting
Valuation. The delivered element of the arrangement, the
license fee, is accounted for in accordance with the Residual
Method. The Companys customer contracts are
non-cancelable agreements. The Company does not provide for
rights of return or price protection on its software. The
Company provides a limited warranty that its software will
perform in accordance with user manuals for varying periods,
which are generally less than one year from the contract date.
The Companys customer contracts generally do not include
conditions of acceptance. However, if conditions of acceptance
are included in a contract or uncertainty exists about customer
acceptance of the software, license revenue is deferred until
acceptance occurs. Sales Generated from the Intersourcing
Offering Subscription revenues generated from the
Intersourcing Offering, are recognized in accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables as a
services arrangement since the customer is purchasing the right
to use UltiPro rather than licensing the software on a perpetual
basis. Fair value of multiple elements in Intersourcing
arrangements is assigned to each element based on the guidance
provided by EITF00-21. The elements that typically exist in
Intersourcing arrangements include hosting services, the right
to use UltiPro, maintenance of UltiPro i.e., product
enhancements and customer support and professional services
i.e., implementation services and training in the use of
UltiPro. The pricing for hosting services, the right to use
UltiPro and maintenance of UltiPro is bundled the Bundled
Elements. Since these three Bundled Elements are
components of recurring revenues in the consolidated statements
of operations, allocation of fair values to each of the three
elements is not necessary since they are not reported
separately. Fair value for the Bundled Elements, as a whole, is
based upon evidence provided by the Companys pricing for
Intersourcing arrangements sold separately. The Bundled Elements
are provided on an ongoing basis and represent undelivered
elements under EITF00-21; they are recognized on a monthly
basis as the services are performed, once the customer has begun
to process payrolls used to pay their employees i.e., goes
Live. Implementation and training services the
Professional Services provided for Intersourcing
arrangements are priced on a time and materials basis and are
recognized as services revenue in the 45 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued consolidated statements of operations as the
services are performed. Fair value for Professional Services is
based on the respective Training Valuation and Implementation
Valuation. Under EITF00-21, fair value is assigned to
service elements in the arrangement based on their relative fair
values, using the prices established when the services are sold
on a stand-alone basis. If evidence of the fair value of one or
more undelivered elements does not exist, the revenue is
deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs
or when fair value can be established. The Company believes that
applying EITF00-21 to Intersourcing arrangements as
opposed to applying SOP97-2 is appropriate given the
nature of the arrangements whereby the customer has no right to
the UltiPro license. Sales of Base Hosting Services Subscription revenues generated from Base Hosting
are recognized in accordance with EITF00-3,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to
Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on
Another Entitys Hardware, which provides guidance as
to the application of SOP97-2 to hosting arrangements that
include a license right to the software. The elements that
typically exist for Base Hosting arrangements include hosting
services and implementation services. Base Hosting is different
than Intersourcing arrangements described above in that the
customer already owns a perpetual license or is purchasing a
perpetual license for UltiPro and is purchasing hosting services
subsequently in a separate transaction whereas, with
Intersourcing, the customer is purchasing the right to use not
license UltiPro. Implementation services provided for Base
Hosting arrangements are substantially less than those provided
for Intersourcing arrangements since UltiPro is already
implemented in Base Hosting arrangements and only needs to be
transitioned to a hosted environment. Fair value for hosting
services is based on the Hosting Valuation. Fair value for
implementation services is assigned in accordance with
guidelines provided by SOP97-2 based on the Implementation
Valuation. Other Services, including Implementation and
Training Services Services revenues include revenues from fees
charged for the implementation of the Companys software
products and training of customers in the use of such products,
fees for other services, including the provision of
payroll-related forms and the printing of FormW-2s
for certain customers, as well as certain reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses. Revenues for training and implementation
consulting services are recognized as services are performed.
Other services are recognized as the product is shipped or as
the services are rendered. Arrangement fees related to fixed-fee
implementation services contracts are recognized using the
percentage of completion accounting method, which involves the
use of estimates. Percentage of completion is measured at each
reporting date based on hours incurred to date compared to total
estimated hours to complete. If a sufficient basis to measure
the progress towards completion does not exist, revenue is
recognized when the project is completed or when we receive
final acceptance from the customer. Recurring Revenues Recurring revenues include maintenance revenues
and subscription revenues. Maintenance revenues are derived from
maintaining, supporting and providing periodic updates for the
Companys software. Subscription revenues are principally
derived from per employee per month PEPM fees
earned through the Intersourcing Offering, Base Hosting and the
business service provider BSPsales channel
defined below, as well as revenues generated from the Ceridian
Agreement defined below. Maintenance revenues are recognized
ratably over the service period, generally one year. Maintenance
and support fees are generally priced as a percentage of the
initial license fee for the underlying products. To the extent
there are upfront fees associated with the Intersourcing
Offering, Base Hosting or the BSP sales channel, subscription
revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related
contract upon the 46 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued delivery of the product and services. PEPM fees
from the Intersourcing Offering, Base Hosting and the BSP sales
channel are recognized as subscription revenue as the services
are delivered. Commencing on August28, 2002, subscription
revenues generated from the Ceridian Agreement are recognized
ratably over the minimum term of the contract, which is expected
to extend until March9, 2008 7years after the
effective date of the Ceridian Agreement. Subscription revenues
of approximately $642,000per month are based on guaranteed
minimum payments from Ceridian Corporation of approximately
$427million over the contract term, including
$175million received to date. Maintenance services provided to customers
include product updates and technical support services. Product
updates are included in general releases to the Companys
customers and are distributed on a periodic basis. Such updates
may include, but are not limited to, product enhancements,
payroll tax updates, additional security features or bug fixes.
All features provided in general releases are unspecified
upgrade rights. To the extent specified upgrade rights or
entitlements to future products are included in a multi-element
arrangement, revenue is recognized upon delivery provided fair
value for the elements exists. In multi-element arrangements
that include a specified upgrade right or entitlement to a
future product, if fair value does not exist for all undelivered
elements, revenue for the entire arrangement is deferred until
all elements are delivered or when fair value can be established. Subscription revenues generated from the BSP
sales channel include both the right to use UltiPro and
maintenance. The BSP is charged a fee on a per employee per
month basis and, in several cases, is subject to a monthly
minimum amount for the term of the related agreement. Revenue is
recognized on a per employee per month basis. The Company does
not host UltiPro for the BSP sales channel. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with
the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No101, Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements SAB
No101 and the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin
No104, Revenue Recognition SAB
No104. Management believes the Company is
currently in compliance with the current provisions set forth in
SOP97-2, SOP98-9, EITF00-21, EITF00-3,
SAB No101 and SAB No104.   
Concentration of Revenues During 2003, one of the Companys customers,
Ceridian, accounted for 17% of total revenues. Ceridian did not
account for more than 10% of total revenues in 2002 or 2001. No
other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in
2003, 2002 or 2001. Of the 17% of total revenues recognized from
Ceridian for 2003, 13% related to recurring revenue recognized
pursuant to the Original Ceridian Agreement, discussed in
Note4, and 4% related to services revenue recognized under
the Ceridian Services Agreement, discussed below. On February10, 2003, the Company entered
into a services agreement the Ceridian Services
Agreement with Ceridian. Under the Ceridian Services
Agreement, the Company provided, through the expiration date,
December31, 2003, various services to Ceridian in exchange
for a total of $225million paid in four equal
installments during each calendar quarter of 2003. Services
revenue from the Ceridian Services Agreement was recognized on a
straight-line basis from the date of the agreement through the
expiration of such agreement.   
Deferred Revenue Deferred revenue is primarily comprised of
deferrals for recurring revenues for which maintenance services
have not yet been rendered, implementation consulting services
for which the services have not yet been
rendered,Intersourcing services which are recognized over
the term of the related contract as the services are performed,
typically two years, and subscription revenues which are
recognized ratably over the term of the related contract upon
the delivery of the product and services. 47 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued
Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues consists of cost of license,
recurring and services revenues. Cost of license revenues
primarily consists of fees payable to a third party for software
products distributed by the Company and, to a lesser degree,
amortization of capitalized software. Cost of recurring revenues
consists of costs to provide maintenance and technical support
to the Companys customers, the cost of providing periodic
updates and the costs of subscription revenues, including
amortization of capitalized software. Cost of service revenues
primarily consists of costs to provide implementation services
and training to the Companys customers, and, to a lesser
degree, costs related to sales of payroll-related forms and
costs associated with reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses. Income Taxes The Company is subject to corporate Federal and
state income taxes and accounts for income taxes under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. SFASNo. 109 provides for a liability approach
under which deferred income taxes are provided based upon
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which
the taxes become payable. Software Development Costs SFASNo86, Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed, requires capitalization of certain software
development costs subsequent to the establishment of
technological feasibility. Based on the Companys product
development process, technological feasibility is established
upon completion of a working model. There were no software costs
capitalized during 2003 or 2002. Annual amortization is based on
the greater of the amount computed using athe ratio that
current gross revenues for the related product bears to the
total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that
product or bthe straight-line method over the remaining
estimated economic life of the product including the period
being reported on. Capitalized software is amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets which are typically three years. Amortization of
capitalized software was $1,519,000, $1,792,000 and $706,000 in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
capitalized software was $44million and $29million
as of December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company
evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on
estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated costs
of completing the products and of performing maintenance and
customer support. If the Companys gross revenues were to
be significantly less than its estimates, the net realizable
value of the Companys capitalized software intended for
sale would be impaired, which could result in the write-off of
all or a portion of the unamortized balance of such capitalized
software. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments,
consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, long-term debt and capital lease obligations
approximated fair value as of December31, 2003 and 2002. 48 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation As permitted by SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company
continues to account for stock-based compensation using the
intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and has made the pro forma disclosures required
by SFASNo123 for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2003. See Note12. SFASNo123 requires pro forma
information for options issued to employees and has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its stock-based
compensation plan under the fair value method. The fair value of
each option granted was estimated at the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions used for grants: risk-free interest rates of
31% for 2003, 27% for 2002 and 53% for 2001, a dividend yield
of 0% for all three years presented, expected volatility of 48%
for 2003, 68% for 2002 and 65% for 2001 and an expected life of

options to purchase shares of its Common Stock to non-employees
for consulting services. See Note12. Earnings Per Share SFASNo128, Earnings Per
Share, requires dual presentation of earnings per
share basic and diluted.
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income
available to common stockholders the numerator by the weighted
average number of common shares the denominator for the
period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar
to basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common
shares had been issued. 49 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND

respectively. Comprehensive Income In 1998, the Company adopted
SFASNo130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and
display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set
of financial statements. The objective of SFASNo130
is to report a measure comprehensive income of all changes in
equity of an enterprise that result from transactions and other
economic events in a period other than transactions with owners.
There are no differences between comprehensive income, as
defined in SFASNo130, and the Companys net
loss for all periods presented. Segment Information The Company adopted SFASNo131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, effective December31, 1998.
SFASNo131 establishes standards for the way that
public companies report selected information about operating
segments in annual and interim financial reports to
shareholders. It also establishes standards for related
disclosures about an enterprises business segments,
products, services, geographic areas and major customers. The
Company operates its business as a single segment. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company adopted SFASNo133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities on January1, 2001. At December31,
2003 and 2002, the Company held no derivative financial
instruments, as defined by SFASNo133, as amended.
Therefore, there was no effect to the Companys
consolidated financial statements upon adoption of
SFASNo133. Business Combinations On July1, 2001, the Company adopted
SFASNo141, Business Combinations, which
addresses financial accounting and reporting for business
combinations and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
APB No16, Business Combinations
and SFASNo38, Accounting for Preacquisition
Contingencies of Purchased Enterprises. All business
combinations in the scope of SFASNo141 are to be
accounted for under the purchase method. The adoption of
SFASNo141 did not have an impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements. Long-Lived Assets
On January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which addresses the
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment 50 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued or disposal of long-lived assets and supercedes
SFASNo121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed
Of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB
No30, Reporting the Results of
Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, for the
disposal of a segment. The adoption of SFASNo144
did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. Intangible Assets On January1, 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, which addresses the financial accounting and
reporting for intangible assets acquired individually or with a
group of other assets but not those acquired in a business
combination at acquisition and supercedes APB Opinion
No17, Intangible Assets. Intangible assets
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of
the asset. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value
of intangible assets to determine whether any impairment of
these assets has occurred or whether any revision to the related
amortization periods should be made. The Company did not record
any impairment for 2003, 2002 or 2001. The adoption of
SFASNo142 had no impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements. Reimbursable Out-Of-Pocket Expenses Effective January1, 2002, the Company
adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging Issues
Task Force No01-14, Income Statement
Characterization of Reimbursements Received for
Out-of-Pocket Expenses Incurred
EITF01-14. EITF01-14 requires
companies to characterize reimbursements received for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred as revenue and to reclassify
prior period financial statements to conform to current year
presentation for comparative purposes. Reimbursable
out-of-pocket expenses, which are included in services revenues
and cost of services revenues in the Companys accompanying
consolidated statements of operations, were $13million 12million and $20million for 2003, 2002 and 2001
respectively. Prior to the adoption of EITF01-14, the
Companys historical consolidated financial statements
offset these amounts within cost of services revenues. Recent Accounting Literature In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, An Interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No51, FIN46R.
FIN46R requires the consolidation of entities in which an
enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected
losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected
residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual
or other financial interests in the entity. Currently entities
are generally consolidated by an enterprise when it has a
controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority
voting interest in the entity. The provisions of FIN46R
are generally effective for existing prior to February1,
2003 variable interest relationships of a public entity no
later than the end of the first reporting period that ends after
March15, 2004. However, prior to the required application
of this interpretation a public entity that is not a small
business issuer shall apply FIN46R to those entities that
are considered to be special-purpose entities no later than the
end of the first reporting period that ends after
December15, 2003. The adoption of FIN46R did not
have an impact on the Companys financial position, results
of operations or cash flows. Effective October1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFASNo149, Amendment of Statement 133
on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFASNo149 amends and clarifies financial accounting
and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain
derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively
referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under
SFASNo133. SFASNo149 is effective for
contracts entered into or modified after September30,
2003, and hedging 51 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued relationships designated after September30,
2003, except for those provisions of SFASNo149
which relate to SFASNo133 Implementation Issues
that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to
June15, 2003. For those issues, the provisions that are
currently in effect should continue to be applied in accordance
with their respective effective dates. In addition, certain
provisions of SFASNo149, which relate to forward
purchases or sales of when-issued securities or other securities
that do not yet exist, should be applied to both existing
contracts and new contracts entered into after
September30, 2003. The adoption of SFASNo149
did not have an impact on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. Effective September1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFASNo150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities
and Equity. SFASNo150 establishes standards
for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
SFASNo150 requires that an issuer classify a
financial instrument that is within the scope of
SFASNo150 as a liability. SFASNo. 150 is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified
after May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective for the
Company beginning September1, 2003. The adoption of
SFASNo150 did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Effective January1, 2003, the Company
adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
SFASNo143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFASNo143, which
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. The adoption of
SFASNo143 did not have a material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Effective January1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFASNo145, Rescission of FASB
Statements No4, 44, 64, Amendment of FASB Statement
No13, and Technical Corrections
SFASNo145. SFASNo145
rescinds FASB Statement No4, 44, 64 and amends
SFASNo13, Accounting for Leases, to
eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for
sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for
certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar
to sale-leaseback transactions. The adoption of
SFASNo145 did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Effective January1, 2003, the Company
adopted SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs
Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFASNo146, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain
Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFASNo146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
Under EITF Issue No94-3, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit
plan. SFASNo146 also establishes that the liability
should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. The
adoption of SFASNo146 did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. Effective December 2002, the Company adopted
SFASNo148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition and Disclosure-An Amendment of
SFASNo. 123 SFASNo148.
SFASNo148 amends SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFASNo123, to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure
requirements of SFAS123 to require prominent disclosures
in not only annual, but also interim financial statements about
the effect the fair value method would have had on reported
results. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of
SFASNo148 are effective for fiscal years ending
after December15 52 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2002. The interim disclosure requirements are
effective for interim periods beginning after December15,
2002. In January 2003, the FASB issued EITF
No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables EITF00-21.
EITF00-21 provides guidance on how to determine whether an
arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than
one unit of accounting and how consideration from the
arrangement should be measured and allocated to the separate
units of accounting in the arrangement. The Company accounted
for Intersourcing Offerings in 2002 by the early adoption of the
provisions of EITF00-21. Effective January1, 2003, the Company
adopted FASB Interpretation No45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees,Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others, FIN45. The provision for
initial recognition and measurement of liability will be applied
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December31, 2002. FIN45 expands previously issued
accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain
guarantees and requires recognition of an initial liability for
the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee.
The adoption of FIN45 did not have an impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. On December17, 2003, the staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC
published Staff Accounting Bulletin104, Revenue
Recognition, SAB104 to revise or
rescind portions of the interpretative guidance included in
Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletin in
order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current
authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and
regulations. The principal revisions relate to the rescission of
material no longer necessary because of private sector
developments in U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles. The adoption of SAB104 during December 2003
did not have an impact on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.   
3.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys cash flows from operations
have historically been insufficient to fund its operations.
Shortfalls in cash flows from operations have been funded
primarily through the private and public sale of equity
securities and, to a lesser extent, equipment financing and
borrowing arrangements. From January1, 2003 through July16,
2003, the Company raised an aggregate of approximately
$175million of capital, net of estimated stock issuance
costs, through the private sales of ia total of
1,708,000shares of the Companys common stock, par
value $001per share the Common Stock, and
warrants to purchase an aggregate 170,800shares of Common
Stock at $400per share to investors, including Ceridian
Corporation and some existing shareholders; and iia
total of 2,200,000shares of Common Stock at $530per
share, before stock issuance costs, to two institutional
investors the Recent Capital Raised. On March27, 2003, the Company amended its
revolving line of credit agreement with Silicon Valley Bank the
Credit Facility to extend the expiration date of
the agreement to May28, 2004. As of December31,
2003, there was no amount outstanding under the Credit Facility.
The Company is in the process of negotiating the potential
renewal of the Credit Facility the Renewal Credit
Facility, but there can be no assurance that the Renewal
Credit Facility will be obtained. On February10, 2003, the Company entered
into a services agreement with Ceridian the Ceridian
Services Agreement under which Ceridian paid Ultimate
Software a total of $225million in four equal
installments during 2003 in exchange for additional services
provided by Ultimate Software. The Ceridian Services Agreement
terminated on December31, 2003. The Company is currently
in negotiations with 53 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Ceridian for the execution of another services
agreement for 2004, the 2004 Ceridian Services
Agreement. There is no guarantee that these negotiations
will be successful. The Company believes that cash and cash
equivalents and cash generated from operations will be
sufficient to fund its operations for at least the next
12months. This belief is based upon, among other factors,
managements expectations for future revenue growth,
controlled expenses and collections of accounts receivable.
However, the Company may seek to raise additional funds during
such period through the sale of additional shares of the
Companys Common Stock, or other securities or borrowings.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise
such funds on terms acceptable to the Company.   
4.
SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS On April24, 2002, the Company dismissed its
independent public accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP
Andersen, and retained KPMG LLP KPMG
as its new independent public accountants. As part of their
quarterly review process for the fiscal quarter ended
March31, 2002, KPMG reviewed, among other things, the
Companys revenue recognition policies, including the
co-branding agreement signed with Ceridian on March9,
2001, as amended from time to time the Original Ceridian
Agreement. Based upon consultations with KPMG as a result
of their review of the Original Ceridian Agreement, the Company
reassessed its original conclusion regarding the timing of the
revenue recognition to be applied to the Original Ceridian
Agreement. When the Company completed a successful transfer
of technology to Ceridian on February5, 2002, a separate
agreement, the Evolution Agreement, defined below, was executed
with Ceridian. The Company had intended to begin recognition of
revenue under the Original Ceridian Agreement on
February5, 2002 upon the successful transfer of technology
to Ceridian. However, when KPMG reviewed the transaction, it was
determined that the Evolution Agreement was an extension of the
Original Ceridian Agreement. The relationship of these two
agreements was based on the application of Technical Practice
Aid TPA 510039. When the determination was made that the two
agreements were related, the UltiPro 60 general release became
a specified upgrade for this arrangement. Since the Company
could not establish fair value for the specified upgrade,
revenue recognition was deferred until the specified upgrade was
delivered. The revenue recognition for the Original Ceridian
Agreement began when the UltiPro 60 general release also known
as Evolution was delivered on August28, 2002. Ceridian is obligated to pay to Ultimate Software
a minimum of approximately $427million, including
$175million received to date, over the minimum term of
the Original Ceridian Agreement. The earliest date upon which
the Original Ceridian Agreement can be terminated by either
party except for an uncured material breach is March9,
2008, resulting in an expected minimum term of 7years the
Minimum Term. Ceridian retains certain rights to
use the software upon termination. The effect of the change in
revenue recognition for the Original Ceridian Agreement was to
modify the date at which revenue recognition would
begin changing the onset of the revenue recognition
process from February5, 2002, which was the date the
Company completed a successful transfer of technology to
Ceridian, to the earlier of ithe delivery of the UltiPro
60 release, or iiJanuary1, 2003. The change in
the timing of revenue recognition applied to the Original
Ceridian Agreement does not impact Ceridians payment
obligations to the Company over the Minimum Term nor does it
impact the nature of the underlying business transaction. On August28, 2002, Ultimate Software
delivered the UltiPro 60 release to Ceridian. The delivery of
UltiPro 60 marked the commencement of recurring revenue
recognition for the Ceridian transaction at the minimum rate of
approximately $642,000per month from that date through
March9, 2008. The recurring revenue amount of
$642,000per month was calculated by aggregating the
minimum guaranteed payments 54 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued under the Original Ceridian Agreement, totaling
$427million, and accreting them over the remaining
minimum life of the contract, which ends March9, 2008. The Original Ceridian Agreement provides for a
monthly fee for all employees paid by Ceridian incorporating
UltiPro software. To the extent this monthly calculation exceeds
the minimum monthly payment, such excess would be recorded as
additional recurring revenue in the month to which it relates,
up to monthly maximum amounts pursuant to the Ceridian Agreement. On February5, 2002, Ultimate Software and
Ceridian entered into an agreement which provided that if
Ultimate Software were to deliver UltiPro 60 on or before
August30, 2002, Ceridian would pay Ultimate Software
$500,000 for such advanced delivery the Evolution
Bonus. The Evolution Bonus, received in September 2002,
was recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying unaudited
consolidated balance sheet. The Evolution Bonus is being
recognized as subscription revenue a component of recurring
revenue ratably over the remaining minimum term of the Ceridian
Agreement and is included in the minimum rate of
$642,000per month through March 2008. The Company awarded
substantially all of the Evolution Bonus to members of the
Companys development team as an incentive bonus for the
early delivery of UltiPro 60 the Incentive Bonus.
The Incentive Bonus was expensed in the three months ended
September30, 2002 and is included with research and
development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement
of operations for the year ended December31, 2002. Under the Original Ceridian Agreement, Ceridian
is permitted to acquire an equity interest in Ultimate through
purchases in the open market or from third parties, subject to a
contractual limitation of 1499% of the outstanding shares of
the Companys Common Stock.   
5.
ACQUISITION On June9, 2003, the Company purchased
substantially all of the assets of HireWorks,Inc., a
software company that developed, marketed and supported an
Internet recruitment solution. The assets acquired included
customer contracts, the source code for its software and
computer equipment. The Company has accounted for this
transaction as a purchase. The resulting intangible asset
related to the customer contracts acquired is being amortized
over 26months.   
6.
STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN On October30, 2000, the Company announced
that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to
1,000,000shares of the Companys outstanding Common
Stock the Stock Repurchase Plan. Stock repurchases
may be made periodically in the open market, in privately
negotiated transactions or a combination of both. The extent and
timing of these transactions will depend on market conditions
and other business considerations. There were no repurchases of
the Companys Common Stock during 2003. During 2002, the
Company purchased 46,150shares of the Companys
Common Stock under the Stock Repurchase Plan at an average cost
of $414per share. As of December31, 2003 and 2002,
the Company had purchased 257,647shares of the
Companys Common Stock under the Stock Repurchase Plan.

The Company has provided a full valuation
allowance on the deferred tax assets as realization of such
amounts is not considered more likely than not. The Company
reviews the valuation allowance requirement periodically and
makes adjustments as warranted. Of the total valuation allowance
at December31, 2003, approximately $1,753,000 is
attributed to net operating losses generated from the exercise
of non-statutory employee stock options, the benefit of which
will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. At December31, 2003, the Company had
approximately $56,623,000 of net operating loss carryforwards
for Federal income tax reporting purposes available to offset
future taxable income. The carryforwards expire through 2023.
Utilization of such net operating losses may be limited as a
result of cumulative ownership changes in the Companys
equity instruments.

Product Liability Software products such as those offered by the
Company frequently contain undetected errors or failures when
first introduced or as new versions are released. Testing of the
Companys products is particularly challenging because it
is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing
environments in which the Companys customers may deploy
these products. Despite extensive testing, the Company from time
to time has discovered defects or errors in products. There can
be no assurance that such defects, errors or difficulties will
not cause delays in product introductions and shipments, result
in increased costs and diversion of development resources,
require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or
customer satisfaction with the Companys products. In
addition, there can be no assurance that, despite testing by the
Company and by current and potential customers, errors will not
be found after commencement of commercial shipments, resulting
in loss of or delay in market acceptance, which could have a
material adverse effect upon the Companys business,
operating results and financial condition. Litigation From time-to-time, the Company is involved in
litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in
the normal course of business. The Company is not currently a
party to any legal proceeding 61 Table of Contents THE ULTIMATE SOFTWARE GROUP,INC. AND
SUBSIDIARY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Companys operating results or

Directors. Additionally, the Leasing Companys business is
managed and operated by a management company the
Management Company pursuant to a management
agreement. Mr.Yanover has a 50% ownership interest in the
general partner of the Management Company. The Company did not
finance equipment with the Leasing Company in 2003. The Company
financed equipment with the Leasing Company totaling $1,007,000
and $258,000 during 2002 and 2001, respectively. Related
amortization was $506,000, $415,000 and $12,000 and total cash
paid was $569,000, $467,000 and $14,000 during 2003, 2002 and
