52 Table of Contents MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to
our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation
and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined
to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with
respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. We have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004. In making this
assessment, we used the criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of
December31, 2004, our internal control over financial
reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
audit report on our assessment of our internal control over
financial reporting. This report appears on page F-2. March14, 2005 F-1 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors Dean Foods Company Dallas, Texas We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Dean Foods Company and subsidiaries the Company as
of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004. We also have audited managements
assessment, included in the accompanying Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys
management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements, an opinion on
managements assessment, and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
companys principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
by the companys board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Dean Foods Company and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period F-2 Table of Contents ended December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment that the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As discussed in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting
for goodwill and other intangible assets to conform to Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No142. DELOITTE TOUCHE

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Our Business We are a leading food
and beverage company. Our Dairy Group is the largest processor
and distributor of milk and various other dairy products in the
United States. The Dairy Group sells its products under a
variety of local and regional brands. Our WhiteWave Foods
Company formerly the Branded Products Group manufacturers,
markets and sells a variety of well-known soy, dairy and
dairy-related nationally branded products including
Silk soymilk and cultured soy products, Horizon
Organic fluid dairy, juices and other products,
International Delight coffee creamers and LAND
OLAKES fluid dairy products. Our Specialty Foods
Group is the leading private label pickle processor in the
United States and a maker of a variety of other food products.
We also own the fourth largest dairy processor in Spain. Basis of Presentation Our Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of our wholly owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of our
Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires us to
use our judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of
net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. Cash Equivalents We consider temporary cash
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to
be cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market. Dairy and certain specialty products
are valued using the first-in, first-out FIFO
method while our pickle inventories are valued using the
last-in, first-out LIFO method. The costs of
finished goods inventories include raw materials, direct labor
and indirect production and overhead costs. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant
and equipment are stated at acquisition cost, plus capitalized
interest on borrowings during the actual construction period of
major capital projects. Also included in property, plant and
equipment are certain direct costs related to the implementation
of computer software for internal use. Depreciation and
amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows   
Asset
Useful Life   
Buildings and improvements
7 to 40years   
Machinery and equipment
3 to 20years We perform impairment tests when circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable. Capitalized leases are
amortized over the shorter of their lease term or their
estimated useful lives. Expenditures for repairs and
maintenance, which do not improve or extend the life of the
assets, are expensed as incurred. F-8 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Intangible and Other Assets Identifiable
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
lives as follows   
Asset
Useful Life   
Customer relationships
Straight-line method over 5 to 15years

Effective January1, 2002, in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142,
goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have
indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized. Instead, we now
conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, trademarks and other
intangible assets with indefinite lives annually and when
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. To determine whether an impairment exists, we use
present value techniques. Upon adoption of
SFASNo142, we conducted transitional impairment
tests and recorded certain impairments during 2002. The results
of these tests indicated that the goodwill related to our Puerto
Rico operations was impaired at January1, 2002. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, we determined that the impairment that
existed as of January1, 2002 was $377million net
of tax. As required by SFAS No142, we recorded the
impairment in our income statement as the cumulative effect of
accounting change retroactive to the first quarter of 2002. See
Note2 for information related to the sale of our Puerto
Rico operations. We also completed an impairment assessment of
our intangibles with indefinite useful lives other than
goodwill, upon adoption of SFAS No142, during the first
quarter of 2002 as of January1, 2002. We determined that
an impairment of $473million net of tax existed at
January1, 2002. The impairment related to certain
trademarks in our Dairy Group and WhiteWave Foods Company
segments, and was recorded in the first quarter as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change. The fair value of
these trademarks was determined using a present value technique. Foreign Currency Translation The financial
statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to
U.S.dollars in accordance with the provisions of
SFASNo52, Foreign Currency Translation.
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
the local currency of the country. Accordingly, assets and
liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated to
U.S.dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense
items are translated at the average rates prevailing during the
year. Changes in exchange rates that affect cash flows and the
related receivables or payables are recognized as transaction
gains and losses in the determination of net income. The
cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders equity
reflects the unrealized adjustments resulting from translating
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries. Minority Interest in Subsidiaries Minority
interest in results of operations of consolidated subsidiaries
represents the minority shareholders share of the income
or loss of various consolidated subsidiaries. Equity in
earnings/losses represents the proportional share of the
earnings or losses of these subsidiaries less any cash
distributions made. At December31, 2004 and 2003, there
were no outstanding minority interests. Stock-Based Compensation We have elected to
follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations in accounting for our stock options. All
options granted to date have been to employees, officers and
directors. No compensation expense has been recognized as the
stock options were granted at exercise prices that were at or
above market value at the grant date. Compensation expense for
grants of stock units SUs is recognized over the
vesting period. See Note11 for more information about our
stock option and SU programs. Had compensation expense been
determined for stock option grants using fair value methods
provided for in SFASNo123, Accounting for F-9 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Sales Recognition and Accounts Receivable
Sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the product has been
shipped to the customer and there is a reasonable assurance of
collection of the sales proceeds. In accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF 01-09, Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer, sales are
reduced by certain sales incentives, some of which are recorded
by estimating expense based on our historical experience. We
provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to
30days, perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers
and maintain allowances for potential credit losses based on
historical experience. Estimated product returns, which have not
been material, are deducted from sales at the time of shipment. Income Taxes All of our wholly owned
U.S.operating subsidiaries are included in our
consolidated tax return. In addition, our proportional share of
the operations of our former majority-owned subsidiaries and
certain of our equity method affiliates, all of which are
organized as limited liability companies or limited
partnerships, are included in our consolidated tax return. Our
foreign subsidiaries are required to file separate income tax
returns in their local jurisdictions. Certain distributions from
these subsidiaries are subject to U.S.income taxes;
however, available tax credits of these subsidiaries may reduce
or eliminate these F-10 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
U.S.income tax liabilities. Other foreign earnings are
expected to be reinvested indefinitely. At December31,
2004, no provision had been made for U.S.federal or state
income tax on approximately $305million of accumulated
foreign earnings. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences
between amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial
Statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current
tax rates. Deferred tax assets, including the benefit of net
operating loss carry-forwards, are evaluated based on the
guidelines for realization and are reduced by a valuation
allowance if deemed necessary. Advertising Expense Advertising expense is
primarily comprised of media, agency and production expenses.
Advertising expenses are charged to income during the period
incurred, except for expenses related to the development of a
major commercial or media campaign which are charged to income
during the period in which the advertisement or campaign is
first presented by the media. Advertising expenses charged to
income totaled $120million in 2004, $1083million in
2003 and $911million in 2002. Additionally, prepaid
advertising costs were $36million and $368,000 at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Shipping and Handling Fees Our shipping and
handling costs are included in both cost of sales and selling
and distribution expense, depending on the nature of such costs.
Shipping and handling costs included in cost of sales reflect
inventory warehouse costs, product loading and handling costs
and costs associated with transporting finished products from
our manufacturing facilities to our own distribution warehouses.
Shipping and handling costs included in selling and distribution
expense consist primarily of route delivery costs for both
company-owned delivery routes and independent distributor
routes, to the extent that such independent distributors are
paid a delivery fee and the cost of shipping products to
customers through third party carriers. Shipping and handling
costs that were recorded as a component of selling and
distribution expense were approximately $113billion 9881million and $9519million during 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Insurance Accruals We retain selected levels
of property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee
health care, workers compensation claims and other
casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered
under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers
with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self-insured
with stop-loss coverages. Accrued liabilities for incurred but
not reported losses related to these retained risks are
calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate
a number of factors including claims history and expected
trends. These loss development factors are developed by us in
consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries. Facility Closing and Reorganization Costs We
have an on-going facility closing and reorganization strategy.
We periodically record facility closing and reorganization
charges when we have identified a facility for closure or other
reorganization opportunity, developed a plan and notified the
affected employees. Effective January1, 2003, we record
these charges in accordance with SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. Facility closings initiated prior to
January1, 2003 continue to be accounted for under the old
guidance. Comprehensive Income We consider all changes
in equity from transactions and other events and circumstances,
except those resulting from investments by owners and
distributions to owners, to be comprehensive income. Stock Split On June9, 2003, we effected
a three-for-two split of our common stock, and on April23,
2002, we effected a two-for-one stock split. All share numbers
contained in our Consolidated Financial Statements and in these
Notes have been adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock
splits. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFAS No132 revised 2003,
Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits in an attempt to improve financial
statement disclosures regarding defined F-11 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
benefit plans. This standard requires that companies provide
more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash
flows, benefit costs and other relevant information. In addition
to expanded annual disclosures, we are required to report the
various elements of pension and other postretirement benefit
costs on a quarterly basis. SFAS No132 revised 2003 is
effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2003,
and for quarters beginning after December15, 2003. The
expanded disclosure requirements are included in this report. On December8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act
was signed into law. The Act introduces a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare PartD, as well as a federal subsidy
to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
PartD. In April 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position
FSP No.SFAS106-2 to address the
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the Act. The
FSP is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after
September15, 2004. Substantially all of our postretirement
benefits terminate at age65. Therefore, the FSP will have
no material affect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements The
FASB issued SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment
in December 2004. It will require the cost of employee
compensation paid with equity instruments to be measured based
on grant-date fair values. That cost will be recognized over the
vesting period. SFASNo123R will become effective
for us in the third quarter 2005. We are still evaluating the
impact of SFASNo123R on our Consolidated
Financial Statements and have not yet determined the transition
method we will apply when we adopt the statement. Refer to the
section Stock-Based Compensation in this Note for an
illustration of the pro-forma impact of expensing our stock
options in the historical periods. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs an Amendment of ARB
No43, Chapter4. SFASNo151, which
is effective for inventory costs incurred during years beginning
after June15, 2005, clarifies the accounting for abnormal
amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and
wasted material, requiring that those items be recognized as
current-period charges. In addition, SFASNo151
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads be based
on the normal capacity of the production facilities. We do not
believe the adoption of this standard will have a material
impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2004, FASB issued SFASNo153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB
Opinion No29. SFASNo153 is effective
for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in years beginning after
June15, 2005. SFASNo153 eliminates the rule
in APB No29 which excluded from fair value measurement
exchanges of similar productive assets. Instead
SFASNo153 excludes from fair value measurement
exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial
substance. We do not believe the adoption of this standard will
have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications
have been made to conform the prior years Consolidated
Financial Statements to the current year classifications.   
2.
ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   
General We completed the acquisitions of 24 businesses during 2004, 2003
and 2002. All of these acquisitions were funded with cash flows
from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and our
accounts receivables-backed facility. F-12 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting as of their respective acquisition dates, and
accordingly, only the results of operations of the acquired
companies subsequent to their respective acquisition dates are
included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. At the
acquisition date, the purchase price was allocated to assets
acquired, including identifiable intangibles, and liabilities
assumed based on their fair market values. The excess of the
total purchase prices over the fair values of the net assets
acquired represented goodwill. In connection with the
acquisitions, assets were acquired and liabilities were assumed
as follows

An additional $158million was paid as part of the
acquisition of the former Dean Foods Company Legacy
Dean. We have not completed the final allocation of purchase price to
the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in 2004, or
the related business integration plans. We expect that the
ultimate purchase price allocation may include additional
adjustments to the fair values of depreciable tangible assets,
identifiable intangible assets and the carrying values of
certain liabilities. Accordingly, to the extent that such
assessments indicate the fair value of the assets and
liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price
allocation, such difference would adjust the amounts allocated
to the assets and liabilities and would change the amounts
allocated to goodwill.   
2004 Acquisitions Milk Products of Alabama On October15,
2004 our Dairy Group acquired Milk Products of Alabama, a dairy
manufacturer based in Decatur, Alabama. Milk Products of Alabama
had net sales of approximately $34million in 2003. As a
result of this acquisition, we have expanded our production
capabilities in the southeastern United States, allowing us to
better serve our customers. Milk Products of Alabamas
results of operations are now included in the Morningstar
division of our Dairy Group. We paid approximately
$232million for the purchase of Milk Products of Alabama,
including costs of acquisition, and funded the purchase price
with borrowings under our senior credit facility. Tiger Foods On May31, 2004, Leche
Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, acquired Tiger Foods, a dairy
processing business with one facility located in Avila, Spain.
Tiger Foods, which had net sales of approximately
$29million in 2003, manufactures and distributes branded
and private label UHT milk and dairy-based drinks throughout
Spain, with an emphasis in the southern and central regions.
Tiger Foods operations complement our Spanish operations
and we expect this acquisition to allow us to reduce our
transportation costs for raw milk and finished products due to
their geographic proximity to our raw milk suppliers and certain
customers. We paid approximately $219million for the
purchase of the company, all of which was funded with borrowings
under our senior credit facility. F-13 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
Soy Processing Facility On April5,
2004, our WhiteWave Foods Company acquired a soy processing and
packaging plant located in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Prior to the
acquisition, the previous owner of the facility co-packed
Silk products for us at the facility. As a result of the
acquisition, we have increased our in-house processing and
packaging capabilities for our soy products, resulting in cost
reductions. We paid approximately $257million for the
purchase of the facility, all of which was funded using
borrowings under our senior credit facility. LAND OLAKES East In 2002, we purchased
a perpetual license to use the LAND OLAKES
brand on certain dairy products nationally, excluding cheese and
butter. This perpetual license was subject, however, to a
pre-existing sublicense entitling a competitor to manufacture
and sell cream, sour cream and whipping cream in certain
channels in the eastern United States. Effective March31,
2004, WhiteWave Foods Company acquired that sublicense and
certain customer relationships of the sublicensee LAND
OLAKES East for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $17million, all of which was funded using
borrowings under our senior credit facility. We now have the
exclusive right to use the LAND OLAKES brand on
certain dairy products other than cheese and butter throughout
the entire United States. Ross Swiss Dairies On January26, 2004,
our Dairy Group acquired Ross Swiss Dairies, a dairy distributor
based in Los Angeles, California, which had net sales of
approximately $120million in 2003. As a result of this
acquisition, we have increased the distribution capability of
our Dairy Group in southern California, allowing us to better
serve our customers. Ross Swiss Dairies has historically
purchased a significant portion of its products from other
processors. Now the majority of products distributed by Ross
Swiss Dairies are manufactured in our southern California
facilities. We paid approximately $218million, including
transaction costs, for the purchase of Ross Swiss Dairies and
funded the purchase price with borrowings under our
receivables-backed facility. Horizon Organic On January2, 2004, we
completed the acquisition of the 87% of Horizon Organic Holding
Corporation Horizon Organic that we did not
already own. Horizon Organic had sales of over $200million
during 2003. We already owned approximately 13% of the
outstanding common stock of Horizon Organic as a result of
investments made in 1998. Third-party co-packers, including us,
have historically done all of Horizon Organics
manufacturing. During 2003, we produced approximately 27% of
Horizon Organics fluid dairy products. We also distributed
Horizon Organics products in several parts of the country.
Horizon Organic is a leading branded organic foods company in
the United States. Because organic foods are gaining popularity
with consumers and because Horizon Organics products offer
consumers an alternative to our Dairy Groups traditional
dairy products, we believe Horizon Organic is an important
addition to our portfolio of brands. The aggregate purchase
price for the 87% of Horizon Organic that we did not already own
was approximately $287million, including approximately
$217million of cash paid to Horizon Organics
stockholders, the repayment of approximately $40million of
borrowings under Horizon Organics former credit
facilities, and transaction expenses of approximately
$9million, all of which was funded using borrowings under
our senior credit facility and our receivables-backed facility.
In addition, each of the options to purchase Horizon
Organics common stock outstanding on January2, 2004
was converted into an option to purchase 7301shares of
our stock, with an aggregate fair value of approximately
$21million. Beginning with the first quarter of 2004,
Horizon Organics financial results are reported in our
WhiteWave Foods Company segment. Other During 2004, our Dairy Group and
Specialty Foods Group completed several smaller acquisitions for
an aggregate purchase price of $233million and
$11million, respectively.   
2003 Acquisitions Cremora On December24, 2003, our
Specialty Foods Group acquired the Cremora branded
non-dairy powdered creamer business from Eagle Family Foods.
Prior to the acquisition, we had been producing Cremora
creamers for Eagle Family Foods pursuant to a co-packing
arrangement, which generated F-14 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
approximately $89million of net sales for us in 2003.
Cremora is the first branded powdered coffee creamer
offering for Specialty Foods. The Cremora brand had sales
of approximately $158million in the twelve months ended
June30, 2003. We purchased the Cremora business for
a purchase price of approximately $126million, all of
which was funded using borrowings under our senior credit
facility. Kohler Mix On October15, 2003, we
acquired Kohler Mix Specialties, Inc., the dairy products
division of Michael Foods, Inc. Kohlers product line
consists primarily of private label ultra-pasteurized ice cream
mixes, creamers and creams, sold primarily in the foodservice
channel. Kohler is included in the Morningstar division of our
Dairy Group segment. The acquisition of Kohler increased the
Dairy Groups ultra-high temperature processing capacity,
which we needed to meet the expanding needs of our WhiteWave
Foods Company segment. Kohler had net sales of approximately
$1875million for the 12months ended August31,
2003 and has three facilities located in White Bear Lake,
Minnesota, Sulphur Springs, Texas and Newington, Connecticut. We
paid approximately $1586million for the purchase of
Kohler, all of which was funded using borrowings under our
receivables-backed facility. Melody Farms On June9, 2003, our Dairy
Group acquired Melody Farms, LLC. Melody Farms, which is now a
part of the Midwest region of our Dairy Group, is a regional
dairy processor based in Livonia, Michigan, that produces fluid
dairy and ice cream products from two facilities in Michigan.
Our acquisition of Melody Farms expanded our distribution reach
and allows us to better serve our customers in the Michigan
area. Melody Farms had net sales of approximately
$116million during the 12months ended March31,
2003. We paid approximately $527million for Melody Farms,
all of which was funded using borrowings under our
receivables-backed facility. Other During 2003, our Dairy Group completed
several small acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of
$226million.   
2002 Acquisitions Maries On May17, 2002, we bought
the assets of Maries Quality Foods, Maries
Dressings, Inc. and Maries Associates, makers of
Maries brand dips and dressings in the
western United States, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $235million. Prior to the acquisition, we
licensed the Maries brand to Maries Quality
Foods and Maries Dressings, Inc. for use in connection
with the manufacture and sale of dips and dressings in the
western United States. As a result of this acquisition, our
WhiteWave Foods Company segment is now the sole owner,
manufacturer and marketer of Maries brand products
nationwide. White Wave, Inc. White Wave On May9,
2002, we acquired the 64% equity interest in White Wave that we
did not already own. White Wave, based in Boulder, Colorado, is
the maker of Silk soymilk and other soy-based products,
and had sales of approximately $125million during the
12months ended March31, 2002. Prior to May9,
2002, we owned approximately 36% of White Wave, as a result of
certain investments made by Legacy Dean beginning in 1999. We
decided to purchase the remaining 64% equity interest, for a
total price of approximately $1928million because of the
success that Silk had experienced in the refrigerated
soymilk category and we believed it was important that we have a
successful branded soymilk offering in order to better serve our
customers and consumers. Other In 2002 our Dairy Group made two
smaller acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of
$8million.   
Divestitures In order to more closely align both our assets and our
management resources with our strategic direction, part of our
strategy is to divest certain non-core assets. On July31,
2003, we completed the sale of our frozen pre-whipped topping
and frozen coffee creamer operations. We recorded a pre-tax gain
on the sale of approximately $662million. Also in July
2003, we sold certain Dairy Group delivery trucks and customer F-15 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
relationships in New York. The proceeds from the sale of
businesses during 2003 were approximately $90million.
During 2002, we completed the sale of the following non-core
businesses acquired as part of Legacy Deans Specialty
Foods division: on January4, 2002, we completed the sale
of the stock of DFC Transportation Company, a contract hauler;
on February7, 2002, we completed the sale of the assets
related to a boiled peanut business; and on October11,
2002, we completed the sale of EBI Foods Limited, a U.K.-based
manufacturer of powdered food coatings. Net proceeds from the
sale of these three businesses totaled approximately
$289million. No gain or loss was recorded on the
divestiture of Legacy Deans businesses during 2002 because
the sales prices equaled the carrying values.   
Discontinued Operations On December30, 2002, we sold our operations in Puerto Rico
for a net price of approximately $1194million. Our
financial statements were restated in 2002 to reflect our former
Puerto Rico business as a discontinued operation. Net sales and income before taxes generated by our Puerto Rico
operations were as follows

Corporate interest expense of $55million in 2002 was

our investment in Puerto Rico to total debt and equity. In the first quarter of 2002, we recognized an impairment charge
of $377million related to the goodwill of our Puerto Rico
operations in accordance with our implementation of
SFASNo142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. This loss is reflected as a cumulative change in
accounting principle in our Consolidated Financial Statements.   
3.
INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES Investment in Consolidated Container Company
We own an approximately 27% minority interest, on a fully
diluted basis, in Consolidated Container Company
CCC, one of the nations largest
manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and our largest
supplier of plastic bottles and bottle components. We have owned
our minority interest since July2, 1999 when we sold our
U.S.plastic packaging operations to CCC. Since July2, 1999, our investment in CCC has been
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During
2001, due to a variety of operational difficulties, CCC
consistently reported operating results that were significantly
weaker than expected, which resulted in significant losses in
the third and fourth quarters of 2001. As a result, by late 2001
CCC had become unable to comply with the financial covenants
contained in its credit facility. We concluded that our
investment was impaired and that the impairment was not
temporary so we wrote off our remaining investment during the
fourth quarter of 2001. In February 2002, CCCs lenders agreed to restructure
CCCs credit agreement to modify the financial covenants,
subject to the agreement of CCCs primary shareholders to
guarantee certain of CCCs indebtedness. Because CCC is an
important and valued supplier of ours, and in order to protect
our interest in CCC, we agreed to provide a limited guarantee of
up to $10million of CCCs revolving credit
indebtedness. By late 2002, CCC was again unable to comply with
the terms of its credit agreement. CCCs lenders agreed to
again restructure CCCs credit agreement, subject to the
agreement of CCCs primary shareholders to F-16 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
provide a total of $35million of additional debt financing
to CCC. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we agreed to
loanCCC $10million of the $35million in
additional financing, in exchange for cancellation of our
pre-existing $10million guaranty and the receipt of
additional equity. Vestar Capital Partners, majority owner of
CCC, loaned CCC the remaining $25million. Our loan to CCC
is due on December31, 2007 or upon the earlier payment in
full of CCCs senior debt and is secured by a subordinate
lien on certain of CCCs assets. The loan is not scheduled
to be repaid until after CCCs senior debt has been paid.
Therefore, our right to enforce payment of the loan is limited
prior to payment in full of CCCs senior debt. The loan
bears interest at the prime rate plus 225%, or the eurodollar
rate plus 325%, at CCCs option. Upon maturity of the
loan, we will be entitled to receive a $400,000 fee, plus an
additional fee in respect of the unpaid principal amount of the
loan from January10, 2003 to the maturity date of the
loan, computed at an annual rate of 113%. Under GAAP, we were
required to recognize a portion of CCCs 2002 losses, up to
the amount of the loan. The loan was written off in its entirety
in the fourth quarter of 2002. Our investment in CCC was
recorded at $0 at December31, 2004 and 2003. Less than 1% of CCC is owned indirectly by Alan Bernon, a member
of our Board of Directors, and his brother Peter Bernon.
Pursuant to our agreements with Vestar, we control two of the
seven seats on CCCs Management Committee. We have
long-term supply agreements with CCC to purchase certain of our
requirements for plastic bottles and bottle components from CCC.
We spent approximately $2355million, $1679million
and $1287million on products purchased from CCC for the
years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, we purchased equipment previously
owned and operated by CCC totaling $32million. Investment in Horizon Organic At
December31, 2003, we had an approximately 13% interest in
Horizon Organic. We accounted for this investment under the
equity method of accounting. On January2, 2004, we
acquired the 87% of Horizon Organic that we did not already own
and began consolidating Horizon Organics results with our
financial results. Our investment in Horizon Organic at
December31, 2003 was recorded at $166million, and
our equity in earnings included in our consolidated statement of
income for 2003 and 2002 was income of $244,000 and a loss of
$69,000, respectively. Investment in Momentx As of December31,
2004 and 2003, we had an approximately 16% interest in Momentx,
Inc. Our investment in Momentx at both December31, 2004
and 2003 was $12million. Momentx is the owner and
operator of dairy.com, an online vertical exchange
dedicated to the dairy industry. We account for this investment
under the cost method of accounting. We spent approximately

In the fourth quarter of 2004, we substantially completed the
purchase price allocation related to our acquisition of Horizon
Organic, and the preliminary amounts initially allocated to
trademarks and customer related intangible assets were adjusted
accordingly. In addition, goodwill was adjusted for changes in
estimated exit costs under contractual obligations entered into
by Horizon Organic prior to our acquisition of them in January
2004. Amortization expense on intangible assets for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $69million 55million and $78million, respectively. Estimated
aggregate intangible asset amortization expense for the next
five years is as follows   
2005

2006
81million   
2007
79million   
2008

2009
76million Our goodwill and intangible assets have resulted primarily from
acquisitions. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first
allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including
trademarks and customer-related intangible assets, with any
remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. Goodwill and
trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized. A trademark is recorded with an indefinite life if it has
sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash
flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable
future. If these perpetual trademark criteria are not met, the
trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives, which
range from five to 40years. Determining the expected life
of a trademark is based on a number of factors including the
competitive environment, market share, trademark history and
anticipated future trademark support. In accordance with SFASNo142, we conduct impairment
tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
annually in the fourth quarter or when circumstances arise that
indicate a possible impairment might exist. If the fair value of
an evaluated asset is less than its book value, the asset is
written down to fair value based on its discounted future cash
flows. Our 2004 annual impairment tests of both goodwill and
intangibles with indefinite lives indicated no impairments. Our
annual impairment test of goodwill conducted F-19 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
in the fourth quarter of 2003 indicated no impairment of
goodwill; as a result of the tests on intangibles with
indefinite lives an impairment of $23million was recorded
for a trademark that we were no longer using. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment
upon a significant change in the operating environment. If an
evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment,
the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is
based on discounted future cash flows.

At December31, 2004, we had approximately
$44million of federal tax credits available for carryover
to future years. The losses are subject to certain limitations
and will expire beginning in 2010. A valuation allowance of $148million has been established
because we believe it is more likely than not that all of the
deferred tax assets relating to state net operating loss and
credit carryovers, foreign tax credit carryovers and capital
loss carryovers will not be realized prior to the date they are
scheduled to expire. F-21 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Senior Credit Facility Our senior credit
facility provides for a $15billion revolving credit
facility and a $15billion term loan. At December31,
2004 there were outstanding term loan borrowings of
$15billion under the senior credit facility, and
$5311million outstanding under the revolving line of
credit. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of
$1293million were issued but undrawn. At
December31, 2004, approximately $8396million was
available for future borrowings under the revolving credit
facility, subject to satisfaction of certain ordinary course
conditions contained in the credit agreement. Both the revolving credit facility and term loan bear interest,
at our election, at the base rate plus a margin that varies from
0 to 625basis points depending on our credit ratings as
issued by Standard Poors and Moodys, or
LIBOR plus a margin that varies from 75 to 1875basis
points, depending on our credit ratings as issued by
Standard Poors and Moodys. The blended
interest rate in effect on borrowings under the senior credit
facility, including the applicable interest rate margin, was
372% at December31, 2004. However, we had interest rate
swap agreements in place that hedged $775million of our
borrowings under the senior credit facility at an average rate
of 496%, plus the applicable interest rate margin. Interest is
payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest
period. Principal payments are required on the term loan as follows   
$5625million quarterly beginning on December31,
2006 through September30, 2008 F-22 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
$2625million quarterly beginning on December31,
2008 through June30, 2009;and     
A final payment of $2625million on the maturity date of
August13, 2009. No principal payments are due on the $15billion revolving
credit facility until maturity on August13, 2009. The credit agreement also requires mandatory principal
prepayments upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions or
recovery events. In consideration for the revolving commitment, we pay a
quarterly commitment fee on unused amounts of the revolving
credit facility that ranges from 25 to 375basis points,
depending on our credit ratings as issued by
Standard Poors and Moodys. The senior credit facility contains various financial and other
restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain
financial ratios, including a leverage and interest coverage
ratio. We are currently in compliance with all covenants
contained in our credit agreement. Our credit agreement permits us to complete acquisitions that
meet the following conditions without obtaining prior approval:
1the acquired company is involved in the manufacture,
processing and distribution of food or packaging products or any
other line of business in which we are currently engaged,
2the net cash purchase price is not greater than
$500million, 3we acquire at least 51% of the
acquired entity, 4the transaction is approved by the
Board of Directors or shareholders, as appropriate, of the
target and 5after giving effect to such acquisition on a
pro-forma basis, we are in compliance with all financial
covenants. All other acquisitions must be approved in advance by
the required lenders. The senior credit facility also contains limitations on liens,
investments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness, and
prohibits certain dispositions of property and restricts certain
payments, including dividends. The senior credit facility is
secured by liens on substantially all of our domestic assets
including the assets of our subsidiaries, but excluding the
capital stock of Legacy Deans subsidiaries, and the real
property owned by Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries. The credit agreement contains standard default triggers,
including without limitation: failure to maintain compliance
with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit
agreement, default on certain of our other debt, a change in
control and certain other material adverse changes in our
business. The credit agreement does not contain any default
triggers based on our credit rating. In August 2004, we amended our senior credit facility to
1increase the size of our revolving credit facility from
$1billion to $15billion, 2increase the size
of our term loanA from $850million to
$15billion, 3eliminate term loans B and C and
4modify the interest rate and payment terms. When we
amended our credit facility, we were required to write-off
approximately $326million of deferred financing costs
that were incurred in connection with our credit facility prior
to the amendment. These costs were being amortized over the
previous terms of the revolving credit facility and term loans. Senior Notes Legacy Dean had certain senior
notes outstanding at the time of the acquisition which remain
outstanding. The notes carry the following interest rates and
maturities   
$993million $100million face value, at 675%
interest, maturing in June 2005     
$2503million $250million face value, at 815%
interest, maturing in 2007     
$188million $200million face value, at 6625%
interest, maturing in 2009;and     
$1271million $150million face value, at 69%
interest, maturing in 2017. F-23 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The related indentures do not contain financial covenants but
they do contain certain restrictions including a prohibition
against Legacy Dean and its subsidiaries granting liens on
certain of their real property interests and a prohibition
against Legacy Dean granting liens on the stock of its
subsidiaries. Receivables-Backed Facility We have entered
into a $500million receivables securitization facility
pursuant to which certain of our subsidiaries sell their
accounts receivable to four wholly-owned special purpose
entities intended to be bankruptcy-remote. The special purpose
entities then transfer the receivables to third party
asset-backed commercial paper conduits sponsored by major
financial institutions. The assets and liabilities of these four
special purpose entities are fully reflected on our balance
sheet, and the securitization is treated as a borrowing for
accounting purposes. During 2004, we made net borrowings of
$1975million on this facility leaving an outstanding
balance of $500million at December31, 2004. The
receivables-backed facility bears interest at a variable rate
based on the commercial paper yield as defined in the agreement.
The average interest rate on this facility was 283% at
December31, 2004. Our ability to re-borrow under this
facility is subject to a standard borrowing base
formula. At December31, 2004 there was no remaining
availability under this facility. In January 2005, we amended
our receivables-backed loan to increase the facility to
$600million. See Note23. Other Lines of Credit Leche Celta, our
Spanish subsidiary, is our only subsidiary with its own lines of
credit separate from the credit facility described above. Leche
Celta utilizes local commercial lines of credit and receivables
factoring facility. At December31, 2004, a total of
$3075million was outstanding on these facilities at an
average interest rate of 264%. Industrial Development Revenue Bonds Certain
of our subsidiaries had revenue bonds outstanding in 2003 and
2004. These bonds were secured by irrevocable letters of credit
issued by financial institutions, along with first mortgages on
the related real property and equipment. In December 2003, we
made payments of $9million, leaving an outstanding balance
of $117million at December31, 2003. During 2004, we
repaid the remaining principal balance on these bonds. Capital Lease Obligations and Other Capital
lease obligations and other subsidiary debt includes various
promissory notes for the purchase of property, plant and
equipment and capital lease obligations. The various promissory
notes payable provide for interest at varying rates and are
payable in monthly installments of principal and interest until
maturity, when the remaining principal balances are due. Capital
lease obligations represent machinery and equipment financing
obligations, which are payable in monthly installments of
principal and interest and are collateralized by the related
assets financed. Letters of Credit At December31, 2004,
there were $1293million of issued but undrawn letters of
credit secured by our senior credit facility. The majority of
these letters of credit were required by various utilities and
government entities for performance and insurance guarantees. Interest Rate Agreements We have interest
rate swap agreements in place that have been designated as cash
flow hedges against variable interest rate exposure on a portion
of our debt, with the objective of minimizing our interest rate
risk and stabilizing cash flows. These swap agreements provide
hedges for loans under our senior credit facility by limiting or
fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified in the senior credit
facility at the interest rates noted below until the indicated
expiration dates of these interest rate swap agreements. The following table summarizes our various interest rate
agreements in effect as of December31, 2004

These swaps are required to be recorded as an asset or liability
on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with an offset
to other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is
effective. Derivative gains and losses included in other
comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings as the
underlying transaction occurs. Any ineffectiveness in our hedges
is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, our derivative liability
totaled $171million and $484million on our
consolidated balance sheet, respectively. This balance includes
approximately $15million and $336million recorded
as a component of accounts payable and accrued expenses at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively and
$21million and $148million recorded as a component
of other long-term liabilities at December31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. There was no hedge ineffectiveness, as
determined in accordance with SFASNo133, for the
years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Approximately $207million and $256million of
losses net of taxes were reclassified to interest expense from
other comprehensive income during the years ended
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We estimate that
approximately $98million of net derivative losses net of
taxes included in other comprehensive income will be
reclassified into earnings within the next 12months. These
losses will partially offset the lower interest payments
recorded on our variable rate debt. We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to
the possibility of interest rates on the credit facilities
falling below the rates on our interest rate swap agreements.
Credit risk under these arrangements is remote because the
counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements are major
financial institutions.   
10.
MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES In three separate transactions during the second quarter of
2003, we called for redemption all of our trust-issued preferred
securities TIPES. We originally issued
$600million of TIPES in a private placement in 1998. The
TIPES were convertible at the option of the holders, at any
time, into shares of our common stock and were redeemable, at
our option, at any time at specified premiums. In response to
our three announced redemption transactions, holders of more
than 99% of all outstanding TIPES elected to convert their TIPES
into shares of our common stock rather than receive the cash
redemption price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of
2003, we issued an aggregate total of approximately
23million shares of common stock to holders of TIPES in
lieu of cash redemption payments, and we paid approximately
$24million in cash to holders who did not elect to
convert. There are no remaining TIPES outstanding.   
11.
STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Our authorized shares of capital stock include 1million
shares of preferred stock and 500million shares of common
stock with a par value of $01per share. Stock Award Plans We currently have two stock
award plans with shares remaining available for issuance. These
plans, which are our 1997 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan
and the 1989 Legacy Dean Stock Awards Plan which we adopted
upon completion of our acquisition of Legacy Dean, provide for
grants of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based
awards to employees, officers, directors and, in some cases,
consultants, up to a maximum of 375million and
approximately 57million shares, respectively. F-25 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Rights Plan On February27, 1998, our
Board of Directors declared a dividend of the right to purchase
one half of one common share for each outstanding share of
common stock to the stockholders of record on F-27 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
March18, 1998. The rights are not exercisable until ten
days subsequent to the announcement of the acquisition of or
intent to acquire a beneficial ownership of 15% or more in Dean
Foods Company. At such time, each right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from us that number of shares of common stock
at an exercise price of $7000, with a market value of up to two
times the exercise price. At any time prior to such date, a
required majority may redeem the rights in whole, but not in
part, at a price of $001per right. The rights will expire
on March18, 2008, unless our Board of Directors extends
the term of, or redeems, the rights. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share
is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is
based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding and the effect of all dilutive common stock
equivalents during each period. The following table reconciles
the numerators and denominators used in the computations of both

Defined Benefit Plans The benefits under our
defined benefit plans are based on years of service and employee
compensation. Our funding policy is to contribute annually the
minimum amount required under ERISA regulations. As of December31, 2004, the latest measurement date, the
accumulated benefit obligation of the pension plans exceeded the
fair value of plan assets. In accordance with
SFASNo87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, we recorded an additional minimum pension
liability of $233million $145million, net of
tax. The adjustment to the additional minimum pension liability
was included in other accumulated comprehen F-30 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit

with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets
were $3034million, $2936million and
$181million, respectively, as of December31, 2004
and $2812million, $2756million and
$1516million, respectively, as of December31, 2003.
Included in the above pension benefit tables is an unfunded
supplemental retirement plan with a liability of
$22million and $58million at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, we consolidated substantially all of our qualified
pension plans into one master trust. We retained investment
consultants to assist our Investment Committee with the
transition of the plans assets to the master trust and to
help our Investment Committee formulate a long-term investment
policy for the newly established master trust. Our current asset
mix guidelines under the investment policy target equities at
65% to 75% of the portfolio and fixed income at 25% to 35%. We determine our expected long-term rate of return based on our
expectations of future returns for the pension plans
investments based on target allocations of the pension
plans investments. Additionally, we consider the
weighted-average return of a capital markets model that was
developed by the plans investment consultants and
historical returns on comparable equity, debt and other
investments. The resulting weighted average expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is 85%. F-32 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

526million Defined Contribution Plans Certain of our
non-union personnel may elect to participate in savings and
profit sharing plans sponsored by us. These plans generally
provide for salary reduction contributions to the plans on
behalf of the participants of between 1% and 20% of a
participants annual compensation and provide for employer
matching and profit sharing contributions as determined by our
Board of Directors. In addition, certain union hourly employees
are participants in company-sponsored defined contribution
plans, which provide for employer contributions in various
amounts ranging from $21 to $39per pay period per
participant. Multi-Employer Pension and Certain Union
Plans Certain of our subsidiaries contribute to
various multi-employer pension and certain union plans, which
are administered jointly by management and union representatives
and cover substantially all full-time and certain part-time
union employees who are not covered by our other plans. The
Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 amended ERISA
to establish funding requirements and obligations for employers
participating in multi-employer plans, principally related to
employer withdrawal from or termination of such plans. We could,
under certain circumstances, be liable for unfunded vested
benefits or other expenses of jointly administered
union/management plans. At this time, we have not established
any significant liabilities because withdrawal from these plans
is not probable or reasonably possible.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS Certain of our subsidiaries provide health care benefits to
certain retirees who are covered under specific group contracts.
As defined by the specific group contract, qualified covered
associates may be eligible to receive major medical insurance

lifetime maximums. F-33 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FACILITY CLOSING AND REORGANIZATION COSTS Facility Closing and Reorganization Costs We
recorded net facility closing and reorganization costs of
$347million, $118million and $191million
during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The charges recorded during 2004 are primarily related to the
following   
Exiting the nutritional beverages business operated by our
Specialty Foods Group segment, including the closure of a
manufacturing facility in Benton Harbor, Michigan     
Closing Dairy Group manufacturing facilities in Madison,
Wisconsin; SanLeandro and South Gate, California;
Westwego, Louisiana; Pocatello, Idaho and Wilkesboro, North
Carolina     
Reorganizing our WhiteWave Foods Company including consolidating
the operations of the three distinct operating units: White
Wave, Horizon Organic, and Dean National Brand Group;and     
Transferring Morningstar Foods private label and
manufacturing operations to the Dairy Group. The charges recorded during 2003 are primarily related to the
following   
Closing of Dairy Group manufacturing/distribution facilities in
Honolulu, Hawaii; South Gate, California; Jamaica, New York; and
Akron, Ohio     
Elimination of certain administrative functions at the Midwest
and Northeast regions of our Dairy Group;and     
Realignment of Morningstar Foods private label business
and manufacturing operations into the Dairy Group. These charges were accounted for in accordance with
SFASNo146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities, which became effective
for us in January 2003. We expect to incur additional charges
related to these restructuring plans of approximately
$71million, including an additional $520,000 in work
force reduction costs and approximately $66million in
shut down and other costs. Approximately $59million and
$1million of these additional charges are expected to be
completed by December 2005 and December 2006, respectively. F-35 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The charges recorded during 2002 are related to the closing of
Dairy Group facilities in Bennington, Vermont and Toledo, Ohio,
a Dairy Group distribution facility in Winchester, Virginia, and
one Morningstar Foods facility in Tempe, Arizona. The charges
also reflect additional costs related to severance on the
closing of our Dairy Group facility in Port Huron, Michigan in
2001, the shutdown of an ice cream production line at our
Englewood, Colorado facility and the closing of a Dairy Group
facilitys administrative offices in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The principal components of our continued reorganization and
cost reduction efforts include the following   
Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility
reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions     
Shutdown costs, including those costs that are necessary to
prepare abandoned facilities for closure     
Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease obligations or
termination costs, utilities and property taxes     
Costs associated with the reorganization of the WhiteWave Foods
Company supply chain and distribution activities, including
termination of certain contractual agreements;and     
Write-downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets,
primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that
are no longer used in operations. The impairments relate
primarily to owned buildings, land and equipment at the
facilities, which are written down to their estimated fair value
and held for sale. The effect of suspending depreciation on the
buildings and equipment related to the closed facilities was not
significant. The carrying value of closed facilities at
December31, 2004 was approximately $158million. We
are marketing these properties for sale. We consider several factors when evaluating a potential facility
closure, including, among other things, the impact of such a
closure on our customers, the impact on production, distribution
and overhead costs, the investment required to complete any such
closure, and the impact on future investment decisions. Some
facility closures are pursued to improve our operating cost
structure, while others enable us to avoid unnecessary capital
expenditures, allowing us to more prudently invest our capital
expenditure dollars in our production facilities and better
serve our customers. In the second quarter of 2004, we sold a closed Dairy Group
facility in Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2003, when we closed this
facility, we recorded facility closing costs, which included a
write-down in the value of the facility and accruals for certain
lease obligations. Because we sold the facility for more than
expected, we reversed the impairment charge by recording a
credit to restructuring expense of $17million and
reversed $470,000 of lease obligations that were cancelled. In the first quarter of 2003, we sold a Dairy Group facility in
Port Huron, Michigan. In 2001, we closed this facility and
recorded facility closing costs, which included a write-down in
the value of the facility. We sold the closed facility for more
than expected, resulting in a gain of $16million. This
gain was recorded as a reduction of facility closing expense in
2003. F-36 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

Acquired Facility Closing and Other Exit
Costs As part of our purchase price allocations,
we accrue costs from time to time pursuant to plans to exit
certain facilities and activities of acquired businesses in
order to rationalize production and reduce costs and
inefficiencies. During 2004, we accrued costs to close two Dairy
Group facilities acquired in 2003 and the Horizon Organic Farm
and Education Center acquired in 2004, as well as to exit
certain acquired contractual obligations. During 2003, we
accrued costs related to the closing of an ice cream facility
acquired in July 2003 by our Dairy Group. One facility was
closed in connection with our acquisition of Maries in May
2002 and several facilities were closed in connection with our
acquisition of Legacy Dean. F-37 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
The principal components of the plans include the following   
Workforce reductions as a result of facility closings, facility
reorganizations and consolidation of administrative functions
and offices     
Shutdown costs, including those costs necessary to clean and
prepare abandoned facilities for closure;and     
Costs incurred after shutdown such as lease or termination
costs, utilities and property taxes after shutdown of the
facility, as well as, costs to exit certain contractual
obligations. Also during 2004, we recorded certain adjustments to reduce our
acquisition liability by approximately $17million related
to exit activities in our Specialty Foods Group segment. The
liabilities were recorded as part of our overall integration and
efficiency efforts related to our acquisition of the former Dean
Foods Company. These adjustments reduced goodwill. Activity with respect to these acquisition liabilities for 2004

OTHER OPERATING INCOMEEXPENSE In the fourth quarter of 2004 we recognized a $59million
gain primarily related to the settlement of litigation. In the third quarter of 2003, we recognized a gain on the sale
of our frozen pre-whipped topping and frozen creamer operations
of $662million. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we
recognized $25million of other operating income as a
result of certain contingencies related to the divestiture of 11
facilities in 2001 being favorably resolved. F-38 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases and Purchase Obligations We lease
certain property, plant and equipment used in our operations
under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such leases,
which are primarily for machinery, equipment and vehicles, have
lease terms ranging from 1 to 20years. Certain of the
operating lease agreements require the payment of additional
rentals for maintenance, along with additional rentals based on
miles driven or units produced. Certain leases require us to
guarantee a minimum value of the leased asset at the end of the
lease. Our maximum exposure under those guarantees is not a
material amount. Rent expense, including additional rent, was
$1291million, $1212million and $1245million
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The composition of capital leases which are reflected as
property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets

Contingent Obligations Related to Milk Supply
Arrangements On December21, 2001, in
connection with our acquisition of the former Dean Foods
Company, we purchased Dairy Farmers of Americas
DFA 338% interest in our Dairy Group. In
connection with that transaction, we entered into two agreements
with DFA designed to ensure that DFA has the opportunity to
continue to supply raw milk to certain of our facilities, or be
paid for the loss of that business. One such agreement is a
promissory note with a 20-year term that bears interest based on
the consumer price index. Interest will not be paid in cash but
will be added to the principal amount of the note annually, up
to a maximum principal amount of $96million. We may prepay
the note in whole or in part at any time, without penalty. The
note will only become payable if we ever materially breach or
terminate one of our milk supply agreements with DFA without
renewal or replacement. Otherwise, the note will expire in 2021,
without any obligation to pay any portion of the principal or
interest. Payments made under the note, if any, would be
expensed as incurred. The other agreement would require us to
pay damages to DFA if we fail to offer DFA the right to supply
milk to certain facilities that we acquired as part of the
former Dean Foods after the pre-existing agreements with certain
other suppliers or producers expire. Contingent Obligations Related to Divested
Operations We have sold several businesses in
recent years. In each case, we have retained certain known
contingent obligations related to those businesses and/ or
assumed an obligation to indemnify the purchasers of the
businesses for certain unknown contingent liabilities, including
environmental liabilities. In the case of the sale of our Puerto
Rico operations, we were required to post collateral, including
one surety bond and one letter of credit, to secure our
obligation to satisfy the retained known liabilities and to
fulfill our indemnification obligation. We believe we have
established adequate reserves for any potential liability
related to our divested businesses. Moreover, we do not expect
any liability that we may have for these retained liabilities,
or any indemnification liability, to be material. Insurance We retain selected levels of
property and casualty risks, primarily related to employee
health care, workers compensation claims and other
casualty losses. Many of these potential losses are covered
under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers
with high deductible limits. In other areas, we are self-insured
with stop-loss coverages. These deductibles range from $350,000
for medical claims to $2million for casualty claims. We
believe we have established adequate reserves to cover these
claims. Litigation, Investigations and Audits We are
parties from time to time to certain claims, litigation, audits
and investigations. We believe that we have established adequate
reserves to satisfy any potential liability we may have under
all such claims, litigations, audits and investigations that are
currently pending. In F-40 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
our opinion, the settlement of any such currently pending or
threatened matter is not expected to have a material adverse
impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.   
19.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Pursuant to SFASNo107, Disclosure About Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, we are required to
disclose an estimate of the fair value of our financial
instruments as of December31, 2004 and 2003.
SFASNo107 defines the fair value of financial
instruments as the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of
accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered
equivalent to fair value. In addition, because the interest
rates on our senior credit facility and most other debt are
variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values. We have senior notes with an aggregate face value of
$700million with fixed interest rates ranging from 6625%
to 815% at December31, 2004. These notes were issued by
Legacy Dean prior to our acquisition of Legacy Dean, and had a
fair market value of $7372million at December31,
2004. We have entered into various interest rate agreements to reduce
our sensitivity to changes in interest rates on our variable
rate debt. The fair values of these instruments and our senior
notes were determined based on fair values for similar
instruments with similar terms. The following table presents the
carrying value and fair value of our senior notes and interest
rate agreements at December31

20.SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS We currently have three reportable segments: the Dairy Group,
WhiteWave Foods Company and the Specialty Foods Group. Our Dairy Group segment is our largest segment. It manufactures,
markets and distributes a wide variety of branded and private
label dairy case products, such as milk, cream, ice cream,
cultured dairy products and juices, to retailers, distributors,
foodservice outlets, schools and governmental entities across
the United States. Our WhiteWave Foods Company segment manufactures, develops,
markets and sells a variety of nationally branded soy, dairy and
dairy-related products, such as Silk soymilk and cultured
soy products, Horizon Organic milk, juice and other
products; International Delight coffee creamers; and
LAND OLAKES fluid and cultured products. WhiteWave
Foods Company sells its products to a variety of customers,
including grocery stores, club stores, natural foods stores,
mass merchandisers, convenience stores and foodservice outlets.
The WhiteWave Foods Companys operations have historically
been conducted through three distinct operating units: White
Wave, Horizon Organic and Dean National Brand Group. We are
currently in the process of consolidating these three operating
units and expect the consolidation to be completed in 2006. Prior to 2004, we had a Morningstar Foods division that
manufactured, marketed and sold all of our nationally branded
products except for our soy products, and also manufactured and
sold private label dairy products. Effective January1,
2004, we 1shifted all of Morningstar Foods private
label sales and all of its manufacturing operations to the Dairy
Group, 2formed the Dean National Brand Group, and
3transferred Morningstar Foods branded business to
the Dean National Brand Group. As a result of this F-41 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
reorganization, we implemented a new segment reporting structure
effective January1, 2004. All periods prior to 2004 have
been restated to reflect our new segment reporting structure. The Dairy Group, which now manufactures a portion of WhiteWave
Foods Companys products, transfers finished products to
WhiteWave Foods Company at or near cost. A small percentage of
our WhiteWave Foods Companys products approximately
$506million and $237million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively are sold through the Dairy Groups direct
store delivery network. Those sales, together with their related
costs, are included in WhiteWave Foods Company for segment
reporting purposes. Fixed assets, capital expenditures and
depreciation related to our facilities that manufacture
WhiteWave Foods Companys products except for two
manufacturing facilities which are owned and operated by White
Wave are reported as part of the Dairy Group, while intangibles
and any associated amortization related to WhiteWave Foods
Companys brands are reported as part of WhiteWave Foods
Company. Our Specialty Foods Group is the nations leading private
label pickle processor, and one of the largest manufacturers and
sellers of non-dairy powdered creamer in the United States. The
Specialty Foods Group also manufactures and sells a variety of
other foods, such as sauces and puddings. Our International Group, which does not qualify as a reportable
segment, manufactures, markets and sells private label and
branded milk, butter and cream through its internal sales force
to retailers and distributors across Spain and Portugal. Net
sales, income and assets of the International Group are
reflected in the charts below on the Corporate/ Other lines. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on operating
profit or loss before gains and losses on the sale of assets,
facility closing and reorganization costs and foreign exchange
gains and losses. Therefore, the measure of segment profit or
loss presented below is before such items. The amounts in the following tables are obtained from reports
used by our executive management team and do not include any
allocated income taxes or management fees. There are no
significant non-cash items reported in segment profit or loss
other than depreciation and amortization.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Real Property Lease We lease the land for our
Franklin, Massachusetts facility from a partnership in which
Alan Bernon, Chief Operating Officer of the Northeast region of
our Dairy Group and a member of our Board of Directors, owns a
1345% minority interest. The remaining interests are owned by
members of Mr.Bernons family. Our lease payments
were $700,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Minority Interest in Consolidated Container Holding
Company We hold our minority interest in
Consolidated Container Company through our subsidiary Franklin
Plastics, Inc., in which we own an approximately 99% interest.
Alan Bernon, Chief Operating Officer of the Northeast region of
our Dairy Group and a member of our Board of Directors, and his
brother, Peter Bernon, collectively own less than 1% of Franklin
Plastics, Inc. We spent approximately $2355million 1679million and $1287million on products
purchased from CCC for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2004 we
purchased equipment previously owned and operated by CCC
totaling $32million. Aircraft Leases On March24, 2003, the
independent members of our Board of Directors voted to purchase
two companies from Gregg Engles our Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of our Board of Directors and Pete Schenkel President
of our Dairy Group and also a member of our Board of Directors.
The companies owned two aircraft which we previously leased from
them. As consideration for the purchase of the lessor companies
from Messrs.Engles and Schenkel, we assumed the
indebtedness that the lessor entities incurred to finance the
purchase of the aircraft. No other consideration was paid to
Mr.Engles or Mr.Schenkel, directly or indirectly.
The aggregate principal balance of the indebtedness that we
assumed was approximately $96million, which approximated
the then-current fair market value of the aircraft. Because the
market value of the assets we acquired in the transaction was
equal to the value of the liabilities that we assumed, there was
no income statement impact related to the transaction. Prior to
the acquisition, we paid the companies a combined total of
$21million during 2002 under the aircraft lease
agreements.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS unaudited Tax Free Spin-Off of Specialty Foods Group On
January27, 2005, we announced our intent to pursue a
tax-free spin-off of our Specialty Foods Group. The spin-off
will create a publicly-traded food manufacturing company serving
the retail grocery and foodservice markets with approximately
1,800 employees and estimated 2005net sales of over
$700million. Also effective January27, 2005, we
hired a management team, headed by Sam Reed, former CEO of
Keebler Foods Company, to lead the new company. In conjunction
with their employment, the management team made a cash
investment of $10million in the Specialty Foods Group,
representing 17% ownership of the new business. As part of the spin-off, we intend to transfer our Mocha
Mix non-dairy creamer, Second Nature egg
substitute and foodservice dressings businesses to the Specialty
Foods Group from WhiteWave Foods Company and our Dairy Group. The spin-off is intended to take the form of a tax-free
distribution to our shareholders of a new publicly-traded stock,
which we expect to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We
expect the spin-off to be completed in the third quarter of
2005, subject to confirmation by the Internal Revenue Service of
the tax-free nature of the transaction, registration of the new
security with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other
customary closing conditions. F-45 Table of Contents DEAN FOODS COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
