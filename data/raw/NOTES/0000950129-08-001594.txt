Holders   20   PARTII   Item 5. Selected Financial Data and our
consolidated financial statements and the notes to those
statements included elsewhere in this report. The following
discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ
materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not
limited to, those set forth under Item1A. Risk
Factors and elsewhere in this report.   General   We are a provider of Internet Protocol IP
network-based solutions for enterprise-class organizations such
as corporations, schools and federal, state and local
governmental agencies. Our solutions consist of network
infrastructure, IP voice and video communications systems,
wireless network connectivity, network storage systems, data
center, and network and data security. Our network
infrastructure and IP voice and video communications solutions
are based primarily on Cisco Systems, Inc. Cisco
technology. We provide our customers with both planning, design
and implementation professional services as well as managed
support services. We believe that our focus and expertise
enables us to better compete in the markets that we serve.
Because we have significant experience planning, designing,
implementing and supporting these IP network-based systems for
enterprises, we believe we are well positioned to deliver
superior solutions to our customers and well positioned to
provide our customers with the best possible support of the
solutions we provide.   The market for the advanced technology solutions we provide is
characterized by rapidly evolving and competing technologies. We
compete with larger and better financed entities. We currently
have fourteen physical offices, which are located in Texas,
California, Idaho, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Utah, Washington and Washington DC. We primarily market to
enterprise-class organizations headquartered in, or making
purchasing decisions from markets that we serve with branch
offices. We plan to continue to expand throughout the
U.S.by establishing additional branch offices in other
markets, either by opening additional new offices or through
acquisition.   We derive revenue from sales of both products and services. In
2007, 2006 and 2005, sales of products made up 867%, 867% and
881% of total revenue and services revenues made up 133   133% and 119% of total revenue.   A key component of our long-term operating strategies is to
improve operating profitability. Our gross profit margin on
product sales is lower than our gross margin on service
revenues. Our gross margin on product sales was 176%, 186% and
157% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and our gross
margin on service revenue was 286%, 259% and 292% for those
same periods. The market for the products we sell is
competitive, and we compete with other suppliers for our
customers business. The principal factors that determine
gross margin on product sales include   
the mix of large, competitively bid sales transactions as
compared to smaller, less competitive transactions   
the mix of new customer transactions, which tend to be more
competitively bid by us, as compared to transactions with
existing customers, which tend to be somewhat less
competitive;and   
the mix of products sold, with certain newer, advanced product
categories generating higher gross margin than other, more
traditional products.   The principal factors that influence gross margin on service
revenue include   
the utilization of our technical engineering resources used to
perform our professional services   
the amount of
NetSurant
recurring, post-sale managed support services as compared to the
cost of operating our managed services support center, which
costs are somewhat fixed   
the mix between the different types of service.   We expect to be able to improve our gross margin on services
revenues if our post-sale managed support services revenue
continues to increase at a more rapid rate than our professional
services revenue. This is because our cost of providing managed
services is somewhat fixed and does not increase in direct
proportion to revenue.   
26 Table of Contents   If we are able to maintain our gross margin on product sales,
improve our gross margin on services revenues and change our
revenue mix to include a larger amount of service revenue our
gross margin on total revenue will improve, which is a key
component of our strategy to improve operating profitability.   Certain of our selling, general and administrative expenses,
such as sales commissions, vary with revenue or gross profit.
Certain other selling, general and administrative expenses are
somewhat fixed and do not vary directly with revenue or gross
profit. We hope to be able to achieve a degree of leverage on
certain categories of selling, general and administrative
expenses as we continue to grow, so that these expenses will
become a lower percentage of revenue, which combined with
improvements in gross margin would increase operating profit
margin from our existing branch offices.   To the extent we continue to open new branch offices our
operating profitability will be negatively impacted because we
expect that opening a new branch office will typically result in
operating losses from the newly opened branch office for a
period of six to eighteen months or more. This is because when
we open a new branch office we must hire sales and engineering
staff before we generate sales and because we incur increased
levels of sales and marketing expense in order to establish our
presence in the new market, and to attract new customers. We
believe it is important to expand rapidly to obtain a national
presence, and that the return on our investment from opening new
offices will be significant over an approximate three to five
year period, relative to the investment required, and therefore
we believe it is in our best interest to open new offices even
though doing so reduces near-term operating profitability.
However, during 2007 we focused on organic growth of our
existing offices and acquisitions to produce growth in order to
improve operating profit margin, which we were successful in
doing. In 2008 we anticipate that we will continue to favor
acquisitions as the preferred method of geographic expansion,
but we will continue to look at opportunities to open new
offices in new markets on a
case-by-case
basis.   We begin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our
strategies for achieving our goals of revenue growth and
improved profitability. From a financial perspective, these
operating strategies have a number of important implications for
our results of operations and financial condition.   Strategy   Over the course of the next several years we plan to improve
profitability by implementing the strategies discussed below. We
believe that our strategies will allow us to continue to
increase total revenues. We also believe our strategies will
enable us to improve our gross margins on our service revenue.
At the same time, we will seek to limit the growth of certain
relatively fixed components of our selling, general and
administrative expenses relative to the growth of revenue so
that those expenses become a relatively smaller percentage of
total revenues. Through a combination of increased revenue,
slightly increased gross margin and somewhat lesser growth of
selling, general and administrative expenses, relative to the
growth of revenue, we hope to be able to increase our operating
margin and increase profitability at a more rapid rate than
revenue increases, particularly from our existing branch
offices. We expect that selling expenses can generally be
expected to increase in proportion to our revenue increases. For
example, our sales and sales management staff earn sales
commissions that are typically calculated as a percentage of
gross profit produced and thus vary in correlation with gross
profit for any given period. Based on our sales commission
plans, we expect variable sales commissions to be approximately
21% to 25% of gross profit, which percentage can vary from
period to period depending on gross profit production under our
various sales commission plans, and due to variations between
gross profit on a financial statement and gross profit that
sales staff are paid on, which can vary due to engineering
resource utilization and other factors. However, other than
sales commissions, our other categories of operating expenses do
not vary in direct proportion to either sales or gross profit,
and we believe that if we are successful in implementing our
strategies, many categories of general and administrative
expenses such as management salaries, administrative wages and
professional expenses will decrease as a percentage of our
total revenues over the long term because we believe we can
achieve some levels of leverage on certain of these operating
expenses.   Our key operating strategies include   
Aligning ourselves with the leading manufacturers of advanced
technology products for IP communications and IP network-based
systems. To this end, Cisco has always been our primary supplier
for network routing   
27 Table of Contents   
and switching and IP telephony products that we offer, and we
align ourselves with what we believe to be the best of
breed manufacturer in each area of technology or specific
product in order to provide our customers with the best
technology available.   
Promoting our
NetSurant
brand of post-sale managed support services to generate
increased recurring services revenues and improve gross margin
on service revenue.   
Increasing the gross revenues from our higher gross margin
services offerings, as compared to product sales that typically
produce relatively lower gross margins.   
Opening new branch offices in new markets.   
Expanding geographically by acquiring complementary businesses
and by opening new offices.   
Marketing to larger customers as we become more of a
national level provider of IP communications
solutions.   
Developing and marketing our own custom products for certain
specialized IP communications solutions.   Increases in the size and volume of the projects we undertake
can challenge our cash management. For example, larger projects
can reduce our available cash by requiring that we carry higher
levels of inventory. Larger projects can also require other
investments in working capital. This is because, in some cases,
we do not receive payments from our customers for extended
periods of time. Until we invoice the customer and are paid, all
of the cash expended on labor and products for the project
remains invested in
work-in-progress
or accounts receivable. We expect that we will need increasing
levels of working capital in the future if we are successful in
growing our business as we intend. To meet our cash requirements
to support planned growth, we expect to rely on capital provided
from our operations and our credit facility, which is
collateralized by our accounts receivable and substantially all
of our other assets.   During 2007, 2006 and 2005, 867%, 867% and 881% of our
revenue was attributable to product sales, while 133%, 133%
and 119% was attributable to services revenues. The gross
profit margins on our services revenues have been substantially
higher than those for product sales. We hope to be able to
increase revenue from services at a more rapid rate than
increases in our product sales revenue. We believe this is
possible if we are successful in marketing our
NetSurant
support services, which generate recurring services revenues. If
we are successful at growing our service revenues at a more
rapid rate than our product sales revenues our overall gross
margin on total revenue should improve. The success of this
aspect of our strategy depends in part on our ability to attract
and retain highly skilled and experienced engineering employees
and the acceptance by the market of our managed support services
offering.   For the last three years, the largest component of our total
cost of sales and service has been purchases of Cisco products.
The majority of those purchases were directly from Cisco. We
typically purchase from various wholesale distributors only when
we cannot purchase products directly from Cisco on a timely
basis. Our reliance on Cisco as the primary supplier for the
products we offer means that our results of operations from
period to period depend substantially on the terms upon which we
are able to purchase these products from Cisco and, to a much
lesser extent, from wholesale distributors of Ciscos
products. Therefore, our ability to manage the largest component
of our cost of sales and service is very limited and depends to
a large degree on maintaining and improving our relationship
with Cisco. Our cost of products purchased from Cisco can be
substantially influenced by whether Cisco sponsors sales
incentive programs and whether we qualify for such incentives.
There is a risk that we may not meet the required incentive
criteria in the future. The respective timing of when vendor
incentives become earned and determinable has created material
fluctuations in our gross margin on product sales in the past.   We also plan to increase our business in other geographic areas
through strategic acquisitions of similar businesses or by
opening our own offices. This aspect of our strategy can affect
our financial condition and results of operations in many ways.
The purchase price for business acquisitions and the costs of
opening offices may require substantial cash and may require us
to incur long term debt. The expenses associated with opening a
new office in a new market may well exceed the gross profit
produced on revenues attributable to such new office for some
time, even if it performs as we expect. It is possible that our
acquisition activities may require that we record substantial
amounts of goodwill if the consideration paid for an acquisition
exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible   
28 Table of Contents   and intangible assets acquired, which we expect is likely. To
the extent an acquisition results in goodwill, we will
reevaluate the value of that goodwill at least annually. If we
determine that the value of the goodwill has been impaired, the
resulting adjustment could result in a non-cash charge to
earnings in the periods of revaluation.   Results
of Operations   Overview   Sources of Revenue.Our revenue consists of
product and service revenue. Product revenue consists of
reselling technology products manufactured by others. Cisco
products represent the majority of the products we sell, but we
also sell network storage products manufactured by Network
Appliance and EMC, certain unified communications products from
Microsoft, and various products that are
best-of-breed in certain areas of the solutions that
we provide, including products from Avotus, Cistera Networks,
Converged Access, IPCelerate, Riverbed, Sagem-Interstar,
Tandberg, Variphy, VMWare and others. Service revenue is
generated by fees from a variety of implementation and support
services. Product prices are typically set by the market for the
products we sell and provide our lowest gross margins. Gross
margin on service revenue varies based on the cost of technical
resources and our utilization of our technical resources, which
are reflected as a cost of service. Certain fixed and flat fee
service contracts that extend over three months or more are
accounted for on the percentage of completion method of
accounting.   Historically, the majority of our services revenue has been
generated from professional services, which we believe varies
somewhat in proportion to our product sales. Professional
services revenue is project oriented and tends to be somewhat
volatile on a quarter-to-quarter basis as projects start and
stop and we redeploy technical resources to new projects. As the
number, frequency and size of our projects continue to grow, we
hope to achieve better utilization of our engineering resources,
resulting in improved gross margins on professional services
revenue and less volatility in the amount of quarterly
professional services revenue realized. The normal sales cycle
for corporate customers typically ranges from approximately
three to six months depending on the nature, scope and size of
the project. Our experience with educational organizations
utilizing
E-Rate
funding, which is a federal government funding program for
schools administered by the Schools and Libraries Division of
the Universal Services Administrative Corporation the
SLD, indicates that the sales cycle for these
projects is generally about six to twelve months or longer.   In mid-2004, INX introduced
NetSurant,
its branded managed support service that consists primarily of
customer service personnel and a support center. This support
service offering requires that we incur the fixed cost to
operate a network operations center to monitor and manage
customers systems. Early in the development of our managed
services offering this fixed cost, as compared to the level of
managed service revenue, resulted in negative gross margins from
our managed service offering. As revenue improved, gross margin
from our managed services offering turned positive and has
improved recently. If we are successful in continuing to realize
increasing levels of managed services revenue, we anticipate
that our gross margin on managed services will eventually exceed
our gross margin on professional services and will improve
overall services gross margins. We recognize support service
revenue evenly over the entire service period for the customer.   Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin.The mix
of our various revenue components, each of which has
substantially different levels of gross margin, materially
influences our overall gross profit and gross margin in any
particular quarter. In periods in which service revenue is high
as compared to product sales, our gross margin generally
improves as compared to periods in which we have higher levels
of product sales. Our gross margin for product sales also varies
depending on the type of product sold, the mix of large revenue
product sales contracts, which typically have lower gross margin
as compared to smaller revenue product sales contracts, which
typically have higher gross margin. Gross margin percentage on
product sales is generally positively influenced by repeat
business with existing customers, which are typically smaller
transactions that generate slightly higher levels of gross
margin as compared to large, competitively bid projects.   Our annual and quarterly gross profit and gross margin on
product sales are materially affected by vendor incentives, most
of which are Cisco incentive programs. The incentive programs
sponsored by Cisco currently enable us to qualify for cash
rebates or product pricing discounts. The most significant
incentive is a Cisco incentive that is generally earned based on
sales volumes of particular Cisco products and customer
satisfaction levels. The   
29 Table of Contents   amounts earned and costs incurred under these programs are
recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold, and the increased
gross profit results in an increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses related to sales commissions. We
recognized vendor incentives of $7,200, $6,303, and $2,876 in
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The amounts earned under
these programs are accrued when they are deemed probable and can
be reasonably measured; otherwise, they are recorded when they
are declared by the vendor or the cash is received, whichever is
earlier. Our product cost and resulting gross profit can vary
significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon vendor
incentive criteria and our ability to qualify for and recognize
such incentives.   A significant portion of our cost of services is comprised of
labor, particularly for our professional services revenue. Our
gross margin on service revenue fluctuates from period to period
depending not only upon the prices charged to customers for our
services, but also upon the level of utilization of our
technical staff. Management of labor cost is important to
maximize gross margin. Our gross margin is also impacted by such
factors as contract size, time and material pricing versus fixed
fee pricing, discounting, vendor incentives and other business
and marketing factors normally incurred during the conduct of
business. Several years ago we purposely over staffed technical
and engineering staff in order to have the technical competency
necessary to gain market share and create a successful
organization. Over the past several years as we have grown, we
have been able to better utilize our technical and engineering
staff and this has helped to improve the gross margin percentage
on service revenue in more recent years as compared to several
years ago. When we open new branch offices in new markets, we
also must over staff technical and engineering resources in
order to have the personnel necessary to win customer
relationships in the new market, and the fact that we opened
multiple new offices in the latter half of 2005 and first half
of 2006 caused gross margin on our professional services to be
reduced during the latter half of 2005 through the early part of
2007. If we open new offices in new markets in the future we
expect gross margin on our professional services to be
negatively impacted by such new branch office operations. The
extent to which total professional services gross margin will be
negatively impacted will vary based on the number and size of
new branch offices we open in any given period, relative to the
number of and size of mature branch offices.   Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.Our selling, general and administrative
expenses include both fixed and variable expenses. Relatively
fixed categories of expenses in selling, general and
administrative expenses include rent, utilities, and
administrative wages. Variable categories of expenses in
selling, general and administrative expenses include sales
commissions and travel, which will usually vary based on our
sales and gross profit. Selling, general and administrative
expenses also include expenses which vary significantly from
period to period but not in proportion to sales or gross profit.
These include legal expenses and bad debt expense, both of which
vary based on factors that are difficult to predict.   A significant portion of our selling, general and administrative
expenses relate to personnel costs, some of which are variable
and others that are relatively fixed. Our variable personnel
costs consist primarily of sales commissions. Sales commissions
are typically calculated based upon our gross profit on a
particular sales transaction and thus generally fluctuate
because of the size of the transaction and the mix of associated
products and services with our overall gross profit. Prior to
2007, sales commissions were approximately 27% to 31% of gross
profit and in 2007, sales commissions were approximately 215%
of gross profit. Bad debt expense generally fluctuates somewhat
in proportion to sales levels, although not always in the same
periods as increases or decreases in sales. Legal expense varies
based on legal issue activity, which can vary substantially from
period to period. Other selling, general and administrative
expenses are relatively fixed and do not vary in direct
proportion to increases in revenue, but will generally increase
over time as the organization grows. We believe that we can
achieve some level of leverage on these somewhat fixed operating
expenses, relative to revenue growth, and if we are successful
in doing so that this will help to increase our net operating
margin.   Acquisitions.Under a Stock Purchase Agreement
dated August31, 2007 the SPA, we purchased
all issued and outstanding capital stock of Select, Inc.
Select. Located in Boston, Massachusetts, Select
is a Cisco-centric solutions provider focused on delivering IP
Telephony, IP Storage and network infrastructure solutions
throughout New England with approximately $40,000 in annual
revenues. The acquisition was completed simultaneously with the
execution of the SPA. The SPA contains customary representations
and warranties and requires Selects shareholders
Shareholders to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising under the SPA, subject to certain
limitations and conditions.   
30 Table of Contents   The consideration paid at closing pursuant to the SPA was
a$6,250 in cash, including $1,000 placed in escrow under
holdback provisions defined in the SPA and
b231,958shares of our Common Stock, $001par
value the Common Stock valued at $1060 per share
or $2,459, which amount of shares was determined by dividing
$2,250 by $970, which is the greater of iaverage
closing price per share for the Common Stock as reported by
Nasdaq for the five consecutive trading days ending
August28, 2007 and ii$950. The President and
major shareholder of Select entered into a five-year noncompete
agreement at closing providing for equal monthly payments of $21
over two years, which were recorded at their present value of
$450. Cash of $6,000 was borrowed from the Acquisition Facility
under the Credit Agreement with Castle Pines Capital LLC. In
connection with the stock purchase, the Credit Agreement with
Castle Pines Capital LLC was amended for the modification of
certain financial covenants and for the addition of Select as a
party to the Credit Agreement. Broker costs and professional
fees of $512 were incurred in the purchase, of which $339 was
paid in cash, $50 accrued, and $123 was paid through the
issuance of 11,598shares of common stock.   Additional purchase consideration is payable based on the Select
branch office revenue and operating profit during the two years
subsequent to the date of the SPA. For the twelve-month period
ending August31, 2008, if revenue is greater than $44,000
and operating profit contribution is greater than or equal to
$1,760, then we shall pay the Shareholders additional purchase
consideration of $600 and will pay the Shareholders an
additional $50 for each $145 of operating profit contribution in
excess of $1,760 of operating profit contribution up to a
maximum of $600 with aggregate maximum of $1,200 in additional
purchase consideration. For the twelve-month period ending
August31, 2009, if revenue is greater than $53,000 and
operating profit contribution is greater than or equal to
$3,710, then we shall pay the Shareholders additional purchase
consideration of $600 and will pay an additional $50 for each
$150 of operating profit contribution in excess of $3,710 up to
a maximum of $600 with an aggregate maximum of $1,200 in
additional purchase consideration. At our option, 50% of such
additional purchase price may be paid in the form of Common
Stock. Additional purchase price consideration, if any, will be
recorded as goodwill.   Under an Asset Purchase Agreement dated February3, 2006,
we purchased the assets and operations of Datatran Network
Systems DNS. DNS is a specialized provider of
network solutions serving the Southern California market. DNS
designs, implements and supports solutions based on Cisco
technologies with a primary focus on IP Telephony. We completed
the acquisition simultaneously with the execution of the Asset
Purchase Agreement. The consideration paid at closing pursuant
to the Asset Purchase Agreement was $1,000 in cash, including
$100 placed in escrow under holdback provisions defined in the
Asset Purchase Agreement and 71,003shares of our common
stock valued at $500. Legal and other costs of $47 were paid in
connection with the transaction, of which $32 was paid in cash
and $15 was paid through the issuance of 2,105shares of
common stock. Additional purchase price consideration valued at
$500 and recorded as goodwill was paid to DNS in June 2007 for
achievement of certain operating profit milestones during the
twelve-month period ending February28, 2007. The
consideration consisted of a cash payment of $250 and issuance
of 25,253shares of our common stock with a value of $250.
The calculation of the number of shares of common stock was
determined by dividing $250 by $990, the average closing price
per share for the common stock as reported by NASDAQ for the
five consecutive trading days prior to March1, 2007.
Additionally, cash of $36 was paid to the broker of the
transaction.   Effective May26, 2005, we acquired the operations and
certain assets of Network Architects, Corp. Network
Architects, a data network and IP telephony systems
design, installation and support business with branches in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and ElPaso, Texas. We paid cash
at closing in the amount of $2,000, common stock valued at
$2,000, and payment of a note payable to a bank in the amount of
$300. We incurred legal and other costs of $65 in connection
with the transaction. Additional purchase price consideration
valued at $965 was paid to Network Architects in June 2006 for
achievement of certain operating profit milestones during the
twelve-month period ended May31, 2006. The consideration
was comprised of $394 paid in cash and 97,413shares of the
our common stock valued at the average closing price per share
as reported by NASDAQ for the five consecutive trading days
ending June28, 2006. Additional purchase price
consideration consisting of 75,000shares of our common
stock, were issued to Network Architects in June 2007 for
achievement of certain operating profit milestones during the
twelve-month period ending May31, 2007. The additional
purchase price consideration was valued at $677, determined by
multiplying the shares issued by the closing price per share for
the common stock as reported by NASDAQ on June29, 2007.
The additional purchase price consideration was recorded as
goodwill.   
31 Table of Contents   Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we will issue
Network Architects a maximum of 75,000shares of common
stock as additional purchase price consideration following the
twelve-month period ending May31, 2008 if operating profit
during such period exceeds $726. If operating profit is less
than the applicable milestone for any of the two years, the
number of shares of common stock issuable will be equal to
75,000 multiplied by the percentage of actual operating profit
during the period as compared to the applicable milestone.
Additional purchase price consideration, if any, will be
recorded as goodwill.   Effective June29, 2005, we acquired the operations and
certain assets of the InfoGroup Northwest, Inc.
InfoGroup network solutions business with branches
in Seattle, Washington, and Portland and Eugene, Oregon. We paid
cash at closing in the amount of $1,900 and shares of our common
stock valued at $500. Legal, broker, and other costs of $123,
were incurred in connection with the transaction, of which $12
was paid through the issuance of 1,586shares of common
stock and the remainder paid in cash. Additional purchase price
consideration valued at $1,430 and recorded as goodwill was paid
to InfoGroup in August 2006 for achievement of certain operating
profit milestones during the twelve-month period ending
June30, 2006. The consideration consisted of $715 paid in
cash and $715 in shares of our common stock. Additionally, cash
and stock valued at $71 was paid to the broker of the
transaction.   Tax Loss Carryforward.Because of our
operating losses in 2003, 2005 and 2006 and exercises of stock
options, we have accumulated a net operating loss carryforward
for federal income tax purposes that, at December31, 2007,
was approximately $5,650. Since United States tax laws limit the
time during which an NOL may be applied against future taxable
income and tax liabilities, we may not be able to take full
advantage of our NOL carryforward for federal income tax
purposes. The carryforward will expire during the period 2023
through 2026 if not otherwise used. A change in ownership, as
defined by federal income tax regulations, could significantly
limit the companys ability to utilize its carryforward. If
we achieve sustained profitability, which may not occur, the use
of net operating loss carryforwards would reduce our tax
liability and increase our net income and available cash
resources. When all operating loss carryforwards have been used
or have expired, we would again be subject to increased tax
expense.   Deferred Tax Assets.In assessing the
realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of
deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which temporary
differences, as determined pursuant to SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, become deductible.
Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in
making this assessment. Managements evaluation of the
realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive
and negative evidence. The weight given to the potential effects
of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to
which it can be objectively verified. During the fourth quarter
of 2007, we reversed the valuation allowance related to the net
operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items as we
determined it was now more likely than not that we would be able
to use the assets to reduce future tax liabilities. The reversal
resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of $535 in 2007
and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax asset on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in PartII, Item8.   
32 Table of Contents   Period Comparisons.The following tables set
forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data derived
from our consolidated statements of operations. Percentages
shown in the table below are percentages of total revenue,
except for the product and service components of cost of goods
sold and gross profit, which are percentages of product and
service revenue, respectively.

Ended December31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended
December31, 2006   Total Revenue.Total revenue increased by
$51,954, or 333%, to $207,967 from $156,013. Products revenue
increased by $44,994 or 333%, to $180,311 from $135,317. The
increase in products revenue is primarily due to four months
revenue contribution of the Select, Inc. acquisition $12,890
and growth in our Austin location $11,900, Federal Division
$8,918, Northwest Region $6,371, and Los Angeles location
$4,264. Services revenue increased by $6,960 or 336%. to
$27,656 from $20,696. The increase in services revenue is
primarily due to growth across substantially all locations, four
months revenue contribution of the Select, Inc. acquisition, and
continued growth in the
NetSurant
post-sale recurring support services revenue.   Gross Profit.Total gross profit increased by
$9,150, or 300%, to $39,647 from $30,497. Overall gross profit
as a percentage of sales decreased to 191% from 195%. Gross
profit on product sales increased $6,615, or 263%, to $31,747
from $25,132 and, as a percentage of product sales, decreased to
176% from 186%. Products gross profit percentage decreased due
to lower vendor rebates as a percentage of products sales,
primarily due to Cisco rebate program changes and
proportionately lower vendor rebates earned on products sales by
the newly acquired Boston location. Vendor rebates represented
40% and 47% of products sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Gross profit on services revenue increased $2,535 or 473% to
$7,900 from $5,365 and gross profit as a percent of services
revenue increased to 286% from 259%. The increase in services
gross margin was the result of improved utilization of
engineering staff in 2007 compared to 2006, higher
NetSurant
margins increasing to 305% in 2007 from 291% in 2006, and the
positive margin impact of revenue recognized $520 as a result
of early cessation of the implementation portion of a contract
with IBM Corporation.   Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by $7,442, or 259% to $36,152 from $28,710.
As a percentage of total revenue, these expenses decreased to
174% from 184%. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due to
improved   
33 Table of Contents   leverage resulting from lower expense growth compared to revenue
growth. 2007 selling, general and administrative expenses
increased due to the sales and administrative costs of the newly
acquired Boston location, additional sales compensation costs on
substantially higher revenues, increased performance based
compensation expense resulting from improved operating results,
and higher professional fees due to increased audit fees and
Sarbanes-Oxley consulting fees. We expect our future selling,
general and administrative expenses to continue to increase for
anticipated revenue growth. However, we expect to limit the
increase of selling, general and administrative expenses so that
these expenses grow at a lesser rate than revenue increases
because some of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature.   Operating Income.Operating income increased
$1,708 to $3,495 from $1,787, primarily due to product and
service revenue increasing 333% compared to the 259% increase
in selling, general and administrative expenses.   Interest and Other Income Expense,
net.Interest and other income expense, net,
changed by $153 to an expense of $79 from an expense of $232
primarily due to lower average borrowings under our credit
facility and increased interest income on the short-term
investment of excess cash.   Income Tax Expense Benefit.Income tax
expense benefit changed by $280 to a benefit of $236 from
expense of $44. The 2007 income tax benefit resulted from the
reversal of the valuation allowance related to the net operating
loss carryforwards and other temporary items of $402, partially
offset by federal and state income tax expense of $166. The
reversal of the valuation allowance was a result of the
determination that it was now more likely than not that we would
be able to use deferred tax assets to reduce future tax
liabilities. This tax benefit was partially offset by federal
and state income tax accruals, which included $135 for the new
Texas Margin Tax initially assessed for 2007.   Income Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of
tax.Income loss from discontinued operations
increased by $399, to income of $83 from a loss of $316. Income
from discontinued operations of $83 was due to the gain on sale
of Valerent of $60, operating income from Valerent and
Stratasoft totaling $51, less income tax expense of $28. The
loss from discontinued operations of $316 in 2006 consisted of a
loss from operations of $1,118, partially offset by the gain on
disposal of Stratasoft in January 2006 of $302, a $469 gain from
settlement of a lawsuit in the Computer Products Division, and a
$31 gain from the sale of Valerent.   Net Income.Net income increased $2,540 to
$3,735 from $1,195, primarily due to product and service revenue
increasing more rapidly than increase in selling, general and
administrative expenses combined with the income tax benefit of
reversing the valuation allowance related to the net operating
loss carryforwards and other temporary items and increased
income from discontinued operations.   Year
Ended December31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended
December31, 2005   Total Revenue.Total revenue increased by
$48,694, or 454%, to $156,013 from $107,319. Products revenue
increased by $40,747 or 431%, to $135,317 from $94,570. The
increase in products revenue is primarily due to the full year
revenue contribution from acquisitions and growth in our Federal
Division business, partially offset by the absence of revenue
from two large education projects generated in 2005. Services
revenue increased by $7,947 or 623%. to $20,696 from $12,749.
The increase in services revenue is primarily due to the full
year revenue contribution from acquisitions, growth in the
NetSurant
post-sale recurring support services revenue, and increased
Federal government contract revenue.   Gross Profit.Total gross profit increased by
$11,921, or 642%, to $30,497 from $18,576. Overall gross profit
as a percentage of sales increased to 195% from 173%. Gross
profit on product sales increased $10,277, or 692%, to $25,132
from $14,855 and, as a percentage of product sales, to 186%
from 157%. Products gross profit percentage improved due to a
greater amount of large volume low margin projects in 2005 than
2006 and reduced costs of sales resulting from higher Cisco
rebates. Cisco rebates represented 47% and 30% of products
sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross profit on services
revenue increased $1,644 or 442% to $5,365 from $3,721 and
gross profit as a percent of services revenue decreased to 259%
from 292%. The decrease in services gross margin was the result
of the increased cost of service related to hiring new
engineering staff prior to generating additional service
revenue, and higher
NetSurant
costs incurred to support increased current business and
expected future growth.   
34 Table of Contents   Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses.Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased by $5,951, or 261% to $28,710 from $22,759.
As a percentage of total revenue, these expenses decreased to
184% from 212%. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was due to a
one-time noncash charge of $5,729 recorded in March 2005 for the
remeasurement of options exchanged as part of the purchase of
the minority interest in the former InterNetwork Experts, Inc.
subsidiary. Excluding this one-time charge, 2005 selling,
general and administrative expenses were $17,030 or 159% of
total 2005 revenue. 2006 selling, general and administrative
expenses increased due to costs to open new offices, full year
costs in acquired locations, additional sales compensation costs
on substantially higher revenues, additional sales and
administrative personnel costs from headcount increases. The
2006 adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment,
increased 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses by
$350. We expect our future selling, general and administrative
expenses to continue to increase for anticipated revenue growth.
However, we expect to limit the increase of selling, general and
administrative expenses so that these expenses grow at a lesser
rate than revenue increases because some of these expenses are
relatively fixed in nature.   Operating Income Loss.Operating income
increased $5,970 to income of $1,787 from a loss of $4,183,
primarily due to the 2005 remeasurement of options expense which
resulted in a charge of $5,729, increased gross profit resulting
from higher revenues and improved margins, partially offset by
increased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2006.   Interest and Other Income Expense,
net.Interest and other income expense, net,
changed by $4 to an expense of $232 from an expense of $236
primarily due lower average borrowings under our credit facility.   Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of
tax.Loss from discontinued operations decreased
by $2,651, to a loss of $316 from a loss of $2,967. The loss
from discontinued operations of $316 in 2006 consisted of a loss
from operations of $1,118, partially offset by the gain on
disposal of Stratasoft in January 2006 of $302, a $469 gain from
settlement of a lawsuit in the Computer Products Division, and a
$31 gain from the sale of Valerent. The loss from discontinued
operations of $2,967 in 2005 consisted of a loss from operations
of $2,973, the cumulative effect of the change in
Stratasofts method of applying the percentage of
completion accounting method of $566, a gain from the adjustment
of previously recorded accruals in the Telecom and Computer
Products Divisions of $106, and an income tax benefit of $466.   Net Income Loss.Net income increased $9,079
to net income of $1,195 from a net loss of $7,884, primarily due
to the 2005 remeasurement of options expense of $5,729, reduced
loss from discontinued operations of $2,651, and increased gross
profit resulting from higher revenues and improved margins,
partially offset by increased selling, general and
administrative expenses in 2006.

of 2007 and the Datatran Network Systems acquisition was
completed in the first quarter of 2006 see Note3 to
consolidated financial statements in PartII, Item8.
The Select, Inc. acquisition contributed revenues of $3,937 and
$9,601 in the third and fourth quarters of 2007, respectively.
The revenue increase between the first and second quarters of
2007 was primarily a result of increased sales in our Austin,
Los Angeles, and Albuquerque locations. The fourth quarter of
2007 reflected the positive margin impact of revenue recognized
$520 as a result of early cessation of the implementation
portion of a contract with IBM Corporation.   
36 Table of Contents   Our gross profit has fluctuated between quarters primarily due
to changes in our revenue mix between products and services
revenues and variations in Cisco vendor rebates. Services gross
profit and gross margin varied primarily based on the level of
utilization of billable technical staff and the type of service
revenues generated, which can vary from period to period and
result in varying levels of gross profit and gross margin.   The respective timing of when vendor incentives become earned
and determinable can create significant quarter to quarter gross
margin fluctuations. During the fourth quarter of 2006,
additional incentives of $691 were recorded as a change in
estimate increasing 2006 income from continuing operations and
net income. While we expect vendor incentives will remain earned
and determinable in future periods, we do not have any assurance
that we will continue to meet the vendor incentive criteria
required to receive the incentive or that the vendor will
continue to offer incentive programs during the future.   Selling, general and administrative expenses fluctuate between
quarters primarily due to variations in sales compensation
directly related to fluctuations in the amount of gross profit
and variations in bonus compensation due executives and managers
resulting from fluctuations in quarterly profitability. The
fourth quarter of 2007 included an adjustment of $167 for the
accrual of vacation pay.   Critical
Accounting Policies   Revenue
Recognition   We have a number of different revenue sources for which revenue
is recognized differently based on the following policies   Products revenue occurs when products manufactured or
otherwise provided by other parties are purchased and resold to
a customer and product payment is not contingent upon
performance of installation or service obligations. If product
acceptance and payment are contingent on installation or service
obligations as specified in the customer contract, revenue is
not recognized until installation occurs. Revenue is recognized
from the sales of hardware when the rights and risks of
ownership have passed to the customer and upon shipment or
receipt by the customer, depending on the terms of the sales
contract with the customer. We recognize revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts billed to
customers for shipping and handling are classified as revenue.   We sell hardware maintenance contracts that are serviced and
supported solely by a third party, who is the primary obligor of
these contracts. There are multiple factors under Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue
No99-19,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent, or
EITF99-19,
but the primary obligor is a strong factor in determining
whether we act as a principal or agent and whether gross or net
revenue presentation is appropriate. As we have concluded that
we are more of an agent in the sale of hardware maintenance
contracts, revenue is reported net of the cost of the hardware
maintenance contracts from the third party.   For arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products
but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment,
or bill and hold arrangements, revenue is not
recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met.   Software is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Position
No97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, and all related
interpretations. Revenue from the sales of software not
requiring significant modification or customization is
recognized upon delivery or installation. Installation services
for third party software do not include significant alterations
to its features or functionality. Third party software vendors
provide all post-contract support for software sold. Revenue is
recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured.   Technical support services revenue, consisting of remote
monitoring and management of customers IP telephony and
network infrastructure equipment and applications, is recognized
ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract.
Commission costs paid in advance are deferred and recognized
ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract.   
37 Table of Contents   Revenue for fixed and flat fee services contracts related
to customized network and IP telephony solutions are recognized
under a proportional performance model utilizing an input based
approach labor hours. Our contracts function similar to a time
and materials type contract and generally do not specify or
quantify interim deliverables or milestones. Such service
contracts encompass the design and installation of IP telephony
and computer networks under which customers receive the benefit
of services provided over the period of contract performance.   Other service revenue is earned from providing
stand-alone services such as billings for engineering and
technician time, installation and programming services, which
are provided on either an hourly basis or a flat-fee basis, and
the service component of maintenance and repair service ticket
transactions. These services are contracted for separately from
any product sale. Other service revenues are recognized when the
service is performed and when collection is reasonably assured.
Revenue arrangements generally do not include specific customer
acceptance criteria. In instances where final acceptance of the
system or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is
deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.   Arrangements with multiple deliverables are arrangements
under which a combination of products and services are provided
to customers. Such arrangements are evaluated under Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue
No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,
EITF00-21,
which addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for
arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple
revenue generating activities. The application of the
appropriate accounting guidance requires judgment and is
dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale
includes hardware, software, services or a combination of these
items.   We enter into product and service contracts for customers that
are generally considered a single arrangement and which include
separate units of accounting for product and for service.
Product primarily consists of IP telephony and computer network
infrastructure components and third party software. Service
encompasses the design and installation of IP telephony and
computer networks and installation of third party software.
Installation services for third party software do not include
significant alterations to its features or functionality. All
products and services are regularly sold separately. For
products and services sold in a single arrangement, the product
is typically delivered first and the related services are
completed within four to six weeks. Product is shipped, billed,
and recognized as revenue independent of services because   
The customer is required to pay the product billing in its
entirety independent of any services performed.   
The product has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and
pricing is comparable whether sold with or without services.   
The product is standard equipment not significantly altered by
installation.   
Installation of the product can be performed by many other
companies.   
Although there is a general right of return relative to
delivered product, delivery of the undelivered items is
considered probable and is substantially in our control.   We recognize revenue for multiple element arrangements based on
the relative fair value of the separate elements. Comparable
products and services are sold on a stand alone basis and under
multiple element arrangements at the same prices. Stand alone
pricing is vendor-specific objective evidence under
EITF00-21.
Customers are not required to and frequently do not select the
same vendor for product and service. The customers
decision does not impact the pricing of the portion of the bid
selected.   Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to
determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents
and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify
delivery. Determination that the fee is fixed or determinable is
based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and
whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.
Accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and
deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of
revenue recognition. These provisions are based on contract
terms and prior claims experience and involve significant
estimates. If these estimates are significantly different from
actual results, our revenue could be impacted.   
38 Table of Contents   We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers
to make required payments. If the financial condition of our
customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of
their ability to make payments, additional allowances might be
required.   Credit and collections policy inherent in our revenue
recognition policy is the determination of the collectibility of
amounts due from our customers, which requires us to use
estimates and exercise judgment. We routinely monitor our
customers payment history and current credit worthiness to
determine that collectibility is reasonably assured and, then in
some instances, require letters of credit in support of
contracted amounts.   This requires us to make frequent judgments and estimates in
order to determine the appropriate period to recognize a sale to
a customer and the amount of valuation allowances required for
doubtful accounts. We record provisions for doubtful accounts
when it becomes evident that the customer will not be able to
make the required payments either at contractual due dates or in
the future. Changes in the financial condition of our customers,
either adverse or positive, could impact the amount and timing
of any additional provision for doubtful accounts that may be
required.   Vendor
Incentive Recognition   We participate in vendor incentive programs, including a
significant vendor incentive program with our primary vendor,
Cisco. These incentives are generally earned based on sales
volume and customer satisfaction levels. The amounts earned
under these programs are accrued when they are deemed probable
and can be reasonably measured; otherwise, they are recorded
when they are declared by the vendor or the cash is received,
which ever is earlier. As a result of these estimates, the
amount of rebates declared by the vendor, or the amount of
rebates received in cash, the effect of vendor incentives on
cost of goods can vary significantly between quarterly and
annual reporting periods. Failure to achieve the requirements
set by the vendor to earn a particular incentive could result in
us not receiving a vendor incentive and result in lower gross
margin on our product sales revenue. The incentives are recorded
as a reduction of cost of goods. Selling, general and
administrative expenses are increased for any associated
commission expense and payroll tax related to the incentives.   Share-Based
Compensation Expense   On January1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment, SFAS123R
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expense based on estimated fair values for share-based payment
awards. SFAS123R supersedes our previous accounting under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 for periods beginning in 2006. In March 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107 SAB107 relating
to SFAS123R. We have utilized the guidance of SAB107
in the adoption of SFAS123R.   SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to be
recognized in the results of operations at their grant-date fair
values. We adopted SFAS123R using the modified prospective
transition method, which requires the application of the
accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first day of
our 2006 fiscal year. Under this transition method, compensation
cost recognized in 2006 includes: acompensation cost for
all share-based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as
of December31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS123,
and bcompensation cost for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS123R. In accordance with the modified
prospective method of adoption, our results of operations and
financial position for prior periods have not been restated.   
39 Table of Contents   We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the
grant-date fair value of an award. The fair value of options
granted during the 2007, 2006 and 2005 periods were calculated
using the following estimated weighted average assumptions   	
2007   2006   2005   Expected volatility   603     631     639     Expected term in years   65   63   80   Risk-free interest rate   44     47     44     Expected dividend yield   0     0     0     Expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the
period IP communications solutions was our primary line of
business. Beginning in 2006, we used the simplified method
outlined in SAB107 to estimate expected lives for options
granted during the period. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the yield on zero-coupon U.S.Treasury securities for a
period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption.
We have not historically issued any dividends and do not expect
to in the future.   We use the straight-line attribution method to recognize expense
for unvested options. The amount of share-based compensation
recognized during a period is based on the value of the awards
that are ultimately expected to vest. SFAS123R requires
forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ
from those estimates. We will re-evaluate the forfeiture rate
annually and adjust it as necessary, and the adjustments could
be material.   Liquidity
and Capital Resources   Sources
of Liquidity   Our principal sources of liquidity are collections from our
accounts receivable and our credit facility with Castle Pines
Capital the Credit Facility, which we believe are
sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity
requirements. We use the Credit Facility to finance the majority
of our purchases of inventory, and to provide working capital
when our cash flow from operations is insufficient. In 2007, we
generated cash flow from operating activities of continuing
operations of $9,997 and cash flow from discontinued operations
of $28. By the fourth quarter of 2007, borrowings under the
interest-bearing portion of our Credit Facility had been
eliminated except for acquisition purposes. Our working capital
increased to $9,583 at December31, 2007 from $7,632 at
December31, 2006 as a result of improved operating results.   To give us greater flexibility to efficiently raise capital and
put us in a position to take advantage of favorable market
conditions as they arise, we have filed a shelf registration
statement on
FormS-3
for primary offerings of securities. The shelf registration
provides the ability to offer and sell, from time to time, in
one or more offerings, shares of our common stock
and/or
warrants to purchase common stock for proceeds in the aggregate
amount up to $100million. The terms of any offering under
this registration statement will be established at the time of
the offering and will be stated in a prospectus supplement if
and when we decide to sell securities under the shelf
registration statement. We currently intend to use the net
proceeds from any offering under the shelf registration
statement for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, and to fund the acquisition of companies, businesses,
technologies, products or assets, as set forth in the
registration statement. However, we currently have no
commitments or agreements for any specific acquisitions, nor do
we have any immediate commitments or plans to offer or sell any
securities under the shelf registration statement.   Accounts Receivable.The timing of our
collection of accounts receivable and payments of our accounts
payable is one of the principal influences on our cash flow from
operations. We typically sell our products and services on
short-term credit terms. We try to minimize our credit risk by
performing credit checks, obtaining letters of credit in certain
instances, and conducting our own collection efforts. Our
accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts,
were $45,128 and $42,424 at December31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The increase in accounts receivable was
attributable to significantly higher sales in the fourth quarter
of 2007 compared to 2006 partially offset by improved
collections.   
40 Table of Contents   Inventory.We had inventory of $1,439 and
$1,157 at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
higher level of 2007 inventory is attributable to customer
orders to be shipped in the first quarter of 2008. We try to
minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce the risk that
the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value. We are
able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products
from our principal suppliers. As noted above, we rely
principally on our Credit Facility to finance our inventory
purchases.   Accounts Payable.We rely on our Credit
Facility to finance a substantial portion of our trade accounts
payable under terms ranging from 30 to 60days. Credit
Facility balances within terms are non-interest bearing and
classified as accounts payable in our balance sheet. Credit
Facility balances outstanding in excess of terms are interest
bearing and classified as notes payable in our balance sheet.
Our accounts payable were $37,233 and $28,798 at
December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in
accounts payable was attributable to significantly increased
purchases directly related to increased sales in the fourth
quarter of 2007 compared to 2006.   Contractual
Obligations   Our contractual cash obligations with terms in excess of one
year primarily consist of lease obligations, substantially all
of which are for office space. All notes payable and other debt,
including our Credit Facility discussed above, have remaining
terms of less than one year. The following table summarizes
contractual cash obligations with terms in excess of one year as
of December31, 2007

noncompete agreement as discussed in Note3 to consolidated
financial statements in PartII, Item8. We do not
have material purchase obligations for inventory. We purchase
inventory to fulfill in-hand orders from customers and we try to
minimize the amount of inventory on hand to reduce the risk that
the inventory will become obsolete or decline in value. We are
able to do this by relying on the ready availability of products
from our principal suppliers.   We expect to be able to meet our contractual cash payment
obligations by their due dates through cash generated from
operations, augmented, if needed, by borrowings under the Credit
Facility.   Credit Facility.On April30, 2007, we
entered into a new $50,000 senior credit facility agreement
Agreement with Castle Pines Capital LLC
CPC to provide inventory financing and to fund
working capital requirements. The new facility with CPC replaced
the $40,000 senior credit facility with CPC. Key terms of the
Agreement are summarized as follows   
The Agreement provides a discretionary line of credit up to a
maximum aggregate amount of $50,000 to purchase inventory from
CPC approved vendors.   
The Agreement provides a working capital revolving line of
credit under the above line of credit with an aggregate
outstanding sublimit of $10million.   
The working capital revolving line of credit incurs interest
payable monthly at the rate of prime plus 05%.   
The Agreement contains customary covenants regarding maintenance
of insurance coverage, maintenance of and reporting collateral,
and submission of financial statements. The Agreement also
contains covenants measured as of the end of each calendar
quarter covering required maintenance of minimum current ratio,
tangible net worth, working capital, and total liabilities to
tangible net worth ratio all as defined in the Agreement, as
amended.   
The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of
our assets.   
41 Table of Contents   
The term of the Agreement is for one year, with automatic
renewals for one year periods, except as otherwise provided
under the Agreement.   On August1, 2007, we entered into an amendment
Amendment to the above Agreement to provide an
additional $10million credit facility specifically for
acquisitions Acquisition Facility. Advances under
the Acquisition Facility will be specific to each acquisition
and subject to approval by CPC based on pre-established criteria
contained in the Amendment. Key terms of the Amendment are
summarized as follows   
$10,000 maximum aggregate commitment for acquisitions.   
Advances under the Acquisition Facility are not to exceed 80% of
purchase price or six times adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the
Amendment, for the twelve months immediately preceding the
acquisition closing date.   
Interest is payable at the rate of prime plus 2%.   
An acquisition commitment fee of 1% of the advance amount is
payable with one-eighth paid at closing and seven-eighths paid
with each loan funding.   
Repayment of each advance under the Acquisition Facility is
interest only for first year then amortizing for 36 to
48months, to be determined for each advance, with no
penalty to prepay any principal balance. The loan will also be
reduced annually by an amount equal to 25% of excess cash flow,
as defined in the Amendment, beginning December31, 2008.   
CPC may negotiate with us to revise existing financial covenants
in conjunction with each advance as required.   
Termination date of the senior credit facility was extended to
August1, 2009, subject to automatic renewal as defined in
the Amendment.   As of December31, 2007, we have used $6,000 of the
borrowing capacity under the Acquisition Facility, which accrues
interest at the rate of 925% prime plus 20%.   As of December31, 2007, borrowing capacity and
availability under the Credit Facility was as follows amounts
in thousands   	
Total Credit Facility     50,000   Borrowing base limitation   14,476     Total borrowing capacity   35,524   Less interest-bearing borrowings     Less non-interest bearing advances   32,519     Total unused availability     3,005   The unused availability is the amount not borrowed,
but eligible to be borrowed. The borrowing base restrictions
generally restrict our borrowings under the Credit Facility to
85% of the eligible receivables, 100% of our Floorplanned
inventory and 75% of Cisco vendor rebates receivable.   We use the Credit Facility to finance purchases of Cisco
products from Cisco and from certain wholesale distributors.
Cisco provides
60-day
terms, and other wholesale distributors typically provide
30-day
terms. Balances under the Credit Facility that are within those
respective
60-day and
30-day
periods the Free Finance Period do not accrue
interest and are classified as accounts payable in our balance
sheet. We refer to non-interest bearing balances as
inventory floor plan borrowings.   To the extent that we have credit availability under the Credit
Facility, it gives us the ability to extend the payment terms
past the Free Finance Period. Amounts extended past the Free
Finance Period accrue interest and are classified as notes
payable on our balance sheet. These extended payment balances
under the Credit Facility accrue interest at the prime rate
725% at December31, 2007plus 05%.   
42 Table of Contents   As defined in the Credit Facility there are restrictive
covenants that are measured at each quarter and year end. The
covenants effective January1, 2008, require us to   
maintain Minimum Tangible Net Worth of $80million   
maintain a maximum Debt to Tangible Net Worth ratio of 60 to 1   
maintain Minimum Working Capital of not less than
$65million;and   
maintain a Current Ratio of not less than 110 to 10.   At December31, 2007, we were in compliance with the loan
covenants, and we anticipate that we will be able to comply with
the loan covenants during the next twelve months. If we violate
any of the loan covenants, we would be required to seek waivers
from CPC for those non-compliance events. If CPC refused to
provide waivers, the amount due under the Credit Facility could
be accelerated and we could be required to seek other sources of
financing.   Cash Flows.During 2007, our cash increased by
$7,545. Operating activities provided $10,025, investing
activities used $5,584 and financing activities provided $3,104.   Operating Activities.Operating activities
provided $10,025 in 2007 as compared to using cash of $710 in
2006 and providing cash of $8,050 in 2005. Adjustments for
non-cash-related items in 2007 of $2,150 included $1,659 from
depreciation and amortization and $653 from share-based
compensation. Changes in asset and liability accounts provided
$4,112. The most significant source was accounts receivable
which provided $2,733 from improved timeliness of collections as
reflected in the reduction of Days Sales Outstanding from 66 to
62. Discontinued operations provided $28 in cash, primarily from
the collection of notes receivable.   Investing Activities.Investing activities
used $5,584 in 2007 compared to the use of $2,606 in 2006 and
$5,084 in 2005. Investing activities related to cash paid for
acquisitions were $4,011 in 2007, $2,177 in 2006, and $4,562 in
2005. Our investing activities related to capital expenditures
in all three years were primarily related to purchases of
computer equipment and software, and to a lesser degree,
leasehold improvements. Discontinued operations provided cash
from investing activities in 2006 of $1,492 as a result of the
sales of Stratasoft and Valerent.   Financing Activities.Financing activities
provided $3,104 compared to providing $2,514 in 2006 and using
$5,344 in 2005. Borrowings under the acquisition credit facility
established during 2007 and utilized for the Select, Inc.
acquisition provided cash of $6,000. Borrowings under the Credit
Facility used cash of $4,350 in 2007, provided cash of $1,886 in
2006, and used cash of $5,658 in 2005. Stock option holders
exercised stock options, which provided cash of $1,449, $613,
and $209 in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141
revised 2007, Business Combinations
SFAS141R. The purpose of issuing the statement is to
replace current guidance in SFAS141 to better represent
the economic value of a business combination transaction. The
changes to be effected with SFAS141R from the current
guidance include, but are not limited to: 1acquisition
costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition;
2known contractual contingencies at the time of the
acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired
measured at their fair value; all other contingencies will be
part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value
only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition
of a liability; 3contingent consideration based on the
outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the
time of the acquisition; 4business combinations achieved
in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the
identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as noncontrolling
interests, in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair
values; and 5a bargain purchase defined as a business
combination in which the total acquisition-date fair value of
the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of
the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest
in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a
gain attributable to the acquirer. The Company does anticipate
that the adoption of SFAS141R will have a future impact on
the way in which business combinations will be accounted for
compared to current practice. SFAS141R is effective for
the Company beginning January1, 2009. Early adoption is
not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
that SFAS141R will have on its financial statements and
disclosures.   
43 Table of Contents   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an amendment of ARB No51
SFAS160. SFAS160 was issued to improve the
relevance, comparability, and transparency of financial
information provided to investors by requiring all entities to
report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in
the same way, that is, as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Moreover, SFAS160 eliminates the diversity
that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an
entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated
as equity transactions. SFAS160 is effective for the
Company beginning January1, 2009. The adoption of
SFAS160 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
SFAS159. SFAS159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. It also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
between entities that choose different measurement attributes
for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS159 does
not: aaffect any existing accounting literature that
requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair
value; bestablish requirements for recognizing and
measuring dividend income, interest income, or interest expense;
or celiminate disclosure requirements included in other
accounting standards. SFAS159 is effective for the Company
beginning January1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS159 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157
SFAS157, Fair Value
Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes
guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. SFAS157 does not
require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS157 is effective for the Company
beginning January1, 2009. However, on December14,
2007, the FASB issued proposed FSP
FAS157-b
which would delay the effective date of SFAS157 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis at least annually. This
proposed FSP partially defers the effective date of Statement
157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and
interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the
scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, the Company will adopt
SFAS157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed FSP
FAS157-b.
The partial adoption of SFAS157 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.   
Item7A.
Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Interest
Rate Risk   We attempt to manage our borrowings under the our senior credit
facility Senior Facility and under our acquisition
facility Acquisition Facility with Castle Pines
Capital LLC to minimize interest expense. The interest rate of
the Senior Facility is the prime rate plus 05% and the interest
rate of the Acquisition Facility is the prime rate plus 20%
see Item7. Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources.
During the year ended December31, 2007, the interest rates
of borrowings under the Senior Facility ranged from 775% to
875% and the interest rates of borrowings under the Acquisition
Facility ranged from 925% to 1025%. A one percent change in
variable interest rates will not have a material impact on our
results of operations or cash flows.

45 Table of Contents   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Stockholders of INX Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
INX Inc. formerly
I-Sector
Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of INX Inc. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.   As discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective January1, 2006 the Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment. Also as
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment
as of January1, 2006, in connection with the adoption of
SEC Staff Accounting BulletinNo108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial
Statements.   /s/GRANT

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies   Basis of Presentation On November3,
2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to
sell the Stratasoft and Valerent subsidiaries as further
discussed in Note4. Therefore, the Stratasoft and Valerent
results of operations and cash flows are classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The remaining
assets and liabilities of Stratasoft and Valerent are classified
as current and noncurrent assets and liabilities of continuing
operations in the accompanying balance sheets for all periods
presented as further discussed in Note4. As a result of
the classification of Stratasoft and Valerent as discontinued
operations, the Company reports under only one segment.   Principles of Consolidation The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of INX
Inc. and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated.   Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents
are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with maturity
of three months or less when purchased. The Company maintains
its cash in bank deposit accounts, which at times, may exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts.   Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable
are recorded at the invoiced amount, are non-interest bearing
and are recorded net of reserves for sales returns and
allowances and an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company
extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business
and generally does not require collateral or other security. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and, in some instances,
requires letters of credit or additional guarantees in support
of contracted amounts. Earnings are charged with a provision for
doubtful accounts based on a current review of the
collectibility of the accounts and using a systematic approach
based on historical collections and age of the amounts due.
Accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against the allowance
for doubtful accounts. Accruals for estimated sales returns and
other allowances and deferrals are recorded as a reduction of
revenue at the time of revenue recognition. These provisions are
based on contract terms and prior claims experience and involve
significant estimates.   Inventory Inventory consists primarily of
Cisco network equipment, computer equipment and components and
is valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on
the first-in
first-out method. Substantially all inventory is finished goods.
Reserves to reduce inventory to market value are based on
current inventory levels, historical usage and product life
cycles.   Property and Equipment Property and equipment
are recorded at cost. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense when incurred, while expenditures for
betterments are capitalized. Disposals are removed at cost less
accumulated depreciation with the resulting gain or loss
reflected in operations in the year of disposal.   Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the
purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets
acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized,
but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more
frequently if facts and circumstances indicate   
52 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair
values. Goodwill is written down when impaired. Based on the
impairment tests performed, there was no impairment of goodwill
in 2007 or 2006.   Intangible Assets Intangible assets are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to ten years
see Note6.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Impairment
losses other than goodwill are recorded on long-lived assets
used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that
the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows
estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying amounts of those assets.   Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for
under the liability method, which requires, among other things,
recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for
the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in the consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. Under this method, deferred income tax liabilities and
assets are determined based on the temporary differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of
existing assets and liabilities and the recognition of available
tax carryforwards. The tax provision allocated to discontinued
operations is based on the incremental tax effect after
computing the tax provision on continuing operations. It is the
companys policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and
the related interest and penalties based upon managements
assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to
be sustained upon examination by tax authorities   Use of Estimates The preparation of the
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenue and expense during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.   Revenue Recognition INX recognizes revenue as
follows   Products revenue occurs when products manufactured or
otherwise provided by other parties are purchased and resold to
a customer and product payment is not contingent upon
performance of installation or service obligations. If product
acceptance and payment are contingent on installation or service
obligations as specified in the customer contract, revenue is
not recognized until installation occurs. Revenue is recognized
from the sales of hardware when the rights and risks of
ownership have passed to the customer and upon shipment or
receipt by the customer, depending on the terms of the sales
contract with the customer. The Company recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Amounts
billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as
revenue.   The Company sells hardware maintenance contracts that are
serviced and supported solely by a third party, who is the
primary obligor of these contracts. There are multiple factors
under Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No99-19,
Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an
Agent, or
EITF99-19,
but the primary obligor is a strong factor in determining
whether the Company acts as a principal or agent and whether
gross or net revenue presentation is appropriate. As the Company
has concluded that it is more of an agent in the sale of
hardware maintenance contract, revenue is reported by the
Company net of the cost of the hardware maintenance contract
from the third party.   For arrangements where the customer agrees to purchase products
but we retain possession until the customer requests shipment,
or bill and hold arrangements, revenue is not
recognized until delivery to the customer has occurred and all
other revenue recognition criteria have been met.   Software is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
Position No.
97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, and all related
interpretations. Revenue from the sales of software not
requiring significant modification or customization is
recognized upon delivery or installation. Installation services
for third   
53 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   party software do not include significant alterations to its
features or functionality. Third party software vendors provide
all post-contract support for software sold by the Company.
Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable,
and collectibility is reasonably assured.   Technical support services revenue, consisting of remote
monitoring and management of customers IP telephony and
network infrastructure equipment and applications, is recognized
ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract.
Commission costs paid in advance are deferred and recognized
ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract.   Revenue for fixed and flat fee services contracts related
to customized network and IP telephony solutions are recognized
under a proportional performance model utilizing an input based
approach labor hours. The Companys contracts function
similar to a time and materials type contract and generally do
not specify or quantify interim deliverables or milestones. Such
service contracts encompass the design and installation of IP
telephony and computer networks under which customers receive
the benefit of services provided over the period of contract
performance.   Other service revenue is earned from providing
stand-alone services such as billings for engineering and
technician time, installation and programming services, which
are provided on either an hourly basis or a flat-fee basis, and
the service component of maintenance and repair service ticket
transactions. These services are contracted for separately from
any product sale. Other service revenues are recognized when the
service is performed and when collection is reasonably assured.
Revenue arrangements generally do not include specific customer
acceptance criteria. In instances where final acceptance of the
system or solution is specified by the customer, revenue is
deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.   Arrangements with multiple deliverables are arrangements
under which a combination of products and services are provided
to customers. Such arrangements are evaluated under Emerging
Issues Task Force Issue No.
00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables,
EITF00-21,
which addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for
arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple
revenue generating activities. The application of the
appropriate accounting guidance requires judgment and is
dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale
includes hardware, software, services or a combination of these
items.   The Company enters into product and service contracts for
customers that are generally considered a single arrangement and
which include separate units of accounting for product and for
service. Product primarily consists of IP telephony and computer
network infrastructure components and third party software.
Service encompasses the design and installation of IP telephony
and computer networks and installation of third party software.
Installation services for third party software do not include
significant alterations to its features or functionality. All
products and services are regularly sold separately. For
products and services sold in a single arrangement, the product
is typically delivered first and the related services are
completed within four to six weeks. Product is shipped, billed,
and recognized as revenue independent of services because   
The customer is required to pay the product billing in its
entirety independent of any services performed.   
The product has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and
pricing is comparable whether sold with or without services.     
The product is standard equipment not significantly altered by
installation.   
Installation of the product can be performed by many other
companies.   
54 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Although there is a general right of return relative to
delivered product, delivery of the undelivered items is
considered probable and is substantially in the control of the
Company.   The Company recognizes revenue for multiple element arrangements
based on the relative fair value of the separate elements.
Comparable products and services are sold on a stand alone basis
and under multiple element arrangements at the same prices.
Stand alone pricing is vendor-specific objective evidence under
EITF00-21.
Customers are not required to and frequently do not select the
same vendor for product and service. The customers
decision does not impact the pricing of the portion of the bid
selected.   Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to
determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents
and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify
delivery. Determination that the fee is fixed or determinable is
based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and
whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.   The Company records taxes applicable under EITF
No06-3
How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to
Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income
Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation on a
net basis. Collectibility is assessed based primarily on the
creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks
and analysis, as well as the customers payment history.
Accruals for estimated sales returns and other allowances and
deferrals are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of
revenue recognition. These provisions are based on contract
terms and prior claims experience and involve significant
estimates. If these estimates are significantly different from
actual results, our revenue could be impacted.   Vendor Incentives INX participates in a
vendor incentive program under which incentives are principally
earned by sales volume, sales growth and customer satisfaction
levels. The amounts earned under these programs are accrued when
they are deemed probable and can be reasonably measured;
otherwise, they are recorded when they are declared by the
vendor or the cash is received, whichever is earlier. As a
result of these estimates, the amount of rebates declared by the
vendor, or the amount of rebates received in cash, the effect of
vendor incentives on cost of goods can vary significantly
between quarterly and annual reporting periods. The incentives
are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods and services.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are increased for
any associated commission expense and payroll tax related to the
incentives. The Company recognized vendor incentives of $7,200,
$6,303 and $2,876 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During
the fourth quarter of 2006, additional incentives of $691 were
recorded as a change in estimate increasing 2006 income from
continuing operations and net income by $691 or $011 per share
basic and $009 per share fully diluted. Accounts receivable
from vendors of $2,851 and $3,280 at December31, 2007 and
2006, respectively, are reported under Accounts
receivable trade in the consolidated balance
sheets.   Advertising Costs Advertising costs consist
of print advertising and trade show materials and are expensed
as incurred.   Research and Development Costs Research and
development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred
and consist primarily of compensation costs, outside services,
and expensed materials. The Company incurred research and
development expenditures of $0, $289 and $162 in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.   Share-Based Compensation On January1,
2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment, SFAS123R which requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on
estimated fair values for share-based payment awards.
SFAS123R supersedes the Companys previous accounting
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
25 for periods beginning in 2006. In March 2005, the
Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107 SAB107 relating
to SFAS123R. The Company has utilized the guidance of
SAB107 in its adoption of SFAS123R.   
55 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to be
recognized in the results of operations at their grant-date fair
values. The Company adopted SFAS123R using the modified
prospective transition method, which requires the application of
the accounting standard as of January1, 2006, the first
day of the Companys 2006 fiscal year. Under this
transition method, compensation cost recognized in 2006
includes: acompensation cost for all share-based
payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of
December31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value
estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS123,
and bcompensation cost for all share-based payments
granted subsequent to December31, 2005, based on the
grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS123R. In accordance with the modified
prospective method of adoption, the Companys results of
operations and financial position for prior periods have not
been restated.   Earnings Per Share Basic net income per share
is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted net income
per share is computed based upon the weighted- average number of
common shares plus the assumed issuance of common shares for all
potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method
See Note7.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments
INXs financial instruments consist of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable for which
the carrying values approximate fair values given the short-term
maturity of the instruments. The carrying value of the
Companys debt instruments approximate their fair value
based on estimates of rates offered to the Company for
instruments with the same maturity dates and security structures.   Audit and Tax Professional Fees Since
inception the Company recorded audit professional fees in the
year under audit and tax professional fees in the year for which
the tax returns were filed. Generally accepted accounting
principles require audit and tax professional fees to be
expensed as incurred, which are primarily in the year subsequent
to the year under audit or the year for which tax returns are
filed. Prior to 2006, the difference between the two methods was
immaterial to the Companys financial position and results
of operations. Applying the guidance of SAB108, the
Company corrected its accounting for audit and tax fees in 2006
by reducing January1, 2006 accrued expenses and retained
deficit in the amount of $125 for the cumulative effect of the
correction.   Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December
2007, the FASB issued SFASNo141 revised 2007,
Business Combinations SFAS141R. The purpose
of issuing the statement is to replace current guidance in
SFAS141 to better represent the economic value of a
business combination transaction. The changes to be effected
with SFAS141R from the current guidance include, but are
not limited to: 1acquisition costs will be recognized
separately from the acquisition; 2known contractual
contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered
part of the liabilities acquired measured at their fair value;
all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired
measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not
that they meet the definition of a liability;
3contingent consideration based on the outcome of future
events will be recognized and measured at the time of the
acquisition; 4business combinations achieved in stages
step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable
assets and liabilities, as well as noncontrolling interests, in
the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values; and
5a bargain purchase defined as a business combination
in which the total acquisition-date fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the
consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in
the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a
gain attributable to the acquirer. The Company does anticipate
that the adoption of SFAS141R will have a future impact on
the way in which business combinations will be accounted for
compared to current practice. SFAS141R is effective for
the Company beginning January1, 2009. Early adoption is
not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
that SFAS141R will have on its financial statements and
disclosures.   In December 2007, the FASB issued SFASNo160,
Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements an amendment of ARB No51
SFAS160. SFAS160 was issued to improve the
relevance, comparability, and transparency of financial
information provided to investors by requiring all entities to
report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in
the same way, that is, as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. Moreover, SFAS160 eliminates the diversity
that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an
entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated
as equity transactions. SFAS160 is   
56 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   effective for the Company beginning January1, 2009. The
adoption of SFAS160 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
SFAS159. SFAS159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. It also establishes presentation and
disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
between entities that choose different measurement attributes
for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS159 does
not: aaffect any existing accounting literature that
requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair
value; bestablish requirements for recognizing and
measuring dividend income, interest income, or interest expense;
or celiminate disclosure requirements included in other
accounting standards. SFAS159 is effective for the Company
beginning January1, 2008. The adoption of SFAS159 is
not expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial statements.   In September 2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157
SFAS157, Fair Value
Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes
guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. SFAS157 does not
require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates
inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting
pronouncements. SFAS157 is effective for the Company
beginning January1, 2009. However, on December14,
2007, the FASB issued proposed FSP
FAS157-b
which would delay the effective date of SFAS157 for all
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those
that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
statements on a recurring basis at least annually. This
proposed FSP partially defers the effective date of Statement
157 to fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and
interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the
scope of this FSP. Effective for 2008, the Company will adopt
SFAS157 except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in proposed FSP
FAS157-b.
The partial adoption of SFAS157 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.

Acquisitions   The Company completed one acquisition in 2007, one acquisition
in 2006, and two acquisitions in 2005. The acquisitions were
consummated to improve the Companys geographical presence
and enhance its technical capabilities.   Select,

outstanding capital stock of Select, Inc. Select.
Located in Boston, Massachusetts, Select is a Cisco-centric
solutions provider focused on delivering IP Telephony, IP
Storage and network infrastructure solutions throughout New
England with approximately $40,000 in annual revenues. The
Company completed the acquisition simultaneously with the
execution of the SPA. The SPA contains customary representations
and warranties and requires Selects shareholders
Shareholders to indemnify the Company for certain
liabilities arising under the SPA, subject to certain
limitations and conditions.   The consideration paid at closing pursuant to the SPA was

were incurred in the purchase, of which $339 was paid in cash,
$50 accrued, and $123 was paid through the issuance of
11,598shares of common stock.   Additional purchase consideration is payable based on the Select
branch office revenue and operating profit during the two years
subsequent to the date of the SPA. For the twelve-month period
ending August31, 2008, if revenue is greater than $44,000
and operating profit contribution is greater than or equal to
$1,760, then the Company shall pay the Shareholders additional
purchase consideration of $600 and will pay the Shareholders an
additional $50 for each $145 of operating profit contribution in
excess of $1,760 of operating profit contribution up to a
maximum of $600 with aggregate maximum of $1,200 in additional
purchase consideration. For the twelve-month period ending
August31, 2009, if revenue is greater than $53,000 and
operating profit contribution is greater than or equal to
$3,710, then INX shall pay the Shareholders additional purchase
consideration of $600 and will pay an additional $50 for each
$150 of operating profit contribution in excess of $3,710 up to
a maximum of $600 with an aggregate maximum of $1,200 in
additional purchase consideration. At the Companys option,
50% of such additional purchase price may be paid in the form of
Common Stock. Additional purchase price consideration, if any,
will be recorded as goodwill.   Pro

recorded as goodwill was paid to DNS in June 2007 for
achievement of certain operating profit milestones during the
twelve-month period ending February28, 2007. The
consideration consisted of a cash payment of $250 and issuance
of 25,253shares of the Companys common stock with a
value of $250. The calculation of the number of shares of
Companys common stock was determined by dividing $250 by
$990, the average closing price per share for the common stock
as reported by NASDAQ for the five consecutive trading days
prior to March1, 2007. Additionally, cash of $36 was paid
to the broker of the transaction.   Network
Architects, Corp.   Effective May26, 2005, the Company acquired the operations
and certain assets of Network Architects, Corp. Network
Architects, a data network and IP telephony systems
design, installation and support business with branches in
Albuquerque, New Mexico, and ElPaso, Texas. The
consideration paid at closing consisted of cash in the amount of
$2,000, common stock valued at $2,000, and payment of a note
payable to a bank in the amount of $300. Legal and other costs
of $65 were paid in cash in connection with the transaction. The
calculation of the 308,166shares of Companys common
stock issued was determined by dividing $2,000 by the average
closing price per share for the Common Stock as reported by AMEX
for the five consecutive trading days ending May20, 2005.   Additional purchase price consideration valued at $965 was paid
to Network Architects in June 2006 for achievement of certain
operating profit milestones during the twelve-month period ended
May31, 2006. The consideration was comprised of $394 paid
in cash and 97,413shares of the Companys common
stock valued at the average closing price per share as reported
by NASDAQ for the five consecutive trading days ending
June28, 2006. Additional purchase price consideration
consisting of 75,000shares of the Companys common
stock, were issued to Network Architects in June 2007 for
achievement of certain operating profit milestones during the
twelve-month period ending May31, 2007. The additional
purchase price consideration was valued at $677, determined by
multiplying the shares issued by the closing price per share for
the common stock as reported by NASDAQ on June29, 2007.
The additional purchase price consideration was recorded as
goodwill.   Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company
will issue Network Architects a maximum of 75,000shares of
common stock as additional purchase price consideration
following the twelve-month period ending May31, 2008 if
operating profit during such period exceeds $726. If operating
profit is less than the applicable milestone for any of the two
years, the number of shares of common stock issuable by the
Company will be equal to 75,000 multiplied by the percentage of
actual operating profit during the period as compared to the
applicable milestone. Additional purchase price consideration,
if any, will be recorded as goodwill.   InfoGroup
Northwest, Inc.   Effective June29, 2005, the Company acquired the
operations and certain assets of the InfoGroup Northwest, Inc.
InfoGroup network solutions business with branches

Discontinued
Operations   Telecom
and Computer Products Divisions   Prior to 2004, INX sold a computer products reselling business,
PBX telephone systems dealer business, and the Telecom Systems
division. During 2005, the Company resolved the collectibility
of certain accounts receivable of these operations. In 2006, the
Company settled a lawsuit for $100 filed in August 2002, by
Inacom Corp. claiming INX owed the sum of approximately $570.
The excess accrual of $469 was reflected in the gain on disposal
of discontinued operations detailed below.   Stratasoft
and Valerent Subsidiaries   On November3, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a plan to sell its Stratasoft and Valerent
subsidiaries. This action was taken due to continuing losses at
Stratasoft and the decision to build value with a focused
strategy in the operations at INX. Under a Stock Purchase
Agreement Agreement dated January26

AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   2006, INX sold all outstanding shares of Stratasofts
common stock for a pretax gain on disposal of $302. Key terms of
the sale are summarized as follows   
All outstanding Stratasoft common stock was sold for a purchase
price of $3,000, which has been or is subject to reduction as
follows   
$800 placed in escrow, which is available to satisfy indemnified
losses, if any, as defined in the Agreement. Funds placed in
escrow are excluded from the estimated gain stated above.
Approximately $604 in indemnified losses, net of interest
earned, have been paid or presented for payment as of
December31, 2007.   
$221 representing a preliminary net working capital adjustment,
as defined. The final working capital adjustment recorded during
June 2006 resulted in the further reduction of the sale proceeds
of $40.   
The Company indemnified the buyer for potential losses as
defined in the Agreement to a maximum of $1,400, inclusive of
amounts placed in escrow. Excess funds held in escrow were
scheduled to be released on January26, 2008. However,
certain potential third-party claims remain outstanding,
including the Schneider Rucinski lawsuit discussed further in
Note15. As provided in the Agreement, funds of $196 held
in escrow at December31, 2007 will not be released until
such claims are resolved.   
The Agreement provided for additional consideration to the
Company if either of the following conditions were met:
1Stratasoft revenue exceeds $10,000 for any consecutive
twelve month period within two years of closing or
2Stratasoft is sold by the buyer to another party prior
to January26, 2008, for an amount in excess of $15,000.
Neither condition was met; therefore, no consideration is due
the Company.   Transaction costs of $815 were incurred by the Company in
connection with the transaction, including the $128 value of
warrants issued to the investment banker for the transaction for
40,000shares of common stock with an exercise price of $6
per share. The warrants expire on January26, 2011.
Additional transaction costs of up to $120 are payable based on
the final sale price. Additional costs of $134 were recorded as
a reduction of the gain on sale for space leased by INX that
will not be subleased to Stratasoft in the future.   The sale of Valerent operations involved two separate
transactions which were closed in October 2006. The managed
services business and related inventory, property and equipment
were sold to OuterNet Management, L.P. for a cash sales price of
$185. The consulting business and related property and equipment
were sold to Vicano Acquisition Corp., a company owned by
Valerents former president and
brother-in-law
of our CEO and largest shareholder. The consulting business was
sold for cash paid at closing of $50 and a $70 promissory note
to be received in twenty-four monthly installments of $3 plus
interest of 10%. Additional consideration of $26 was earned for
the first earnout period ended October12, 2007 and
additional consideration is due to the Company if certain
revenue thresholds and conditions are met during the second
earnout period ended October12, 2008. The Company recorded
a gain of $25 on the cash component of the transactions and will
record a gain on proceeds under the $70 promissory note as
received, of which a cumulative total of $41 was received
through December31, 2007.

revenue under the percentage of completion method based on the
relationship of total cost incurred to total estimated cost over
the duration of the project. Effective January1, 2005, the
Stratasoft segment changed its method of applying the percentage
of completion accounting method to the relationship of labor
cost incurred to total estimated labor cost over the duration of
the project. Management believes the newly adopted method of
applying the accounting principle is preferable in
Stratasofts circumstances because using labor cost as the
input measure more accurately reflects the labor intensive
customization and modification that now occurs to the Stratasoft
hardware and software more evenly over the duration of
Stratasofts projects. Accordingly, the labor cost input
method more appropriately measures the progress towards
completion over the duration of Stratasofts projects.

STATEMENTSContinued   On April30, 2007, the Company entered into a new $50,000
senior credit facility agreement Agreement with
Castle Pines Capital LLC CPC to provide inventory
financing and to fund working capital requirements. The new
facility with CPC replaced the $40,000 senior credit facility
with CPC. Key terms of the Agreement are summarized as follows   
The Agreement provides a discretionary line of credit up to a
maximum aggregate amount of $50,000 to purchase inventory from
CPC approved vendors.   
The Agreement provides a working capital revolving line of
credit under the above line of credit with an aggregate
outstanding sublimit of $10million.   
The working capital revolving line of credit incurs interest
payable monthly at the rate of prime plus 05%.   
The Agreement contains customary covenants regarding maintenance
of insurance coverage, maintenance of and reporting collateral,
and submission of financial statements. The Agreement also
contains covenants measured as of the end of each calendar
quarter covering required maintenance of minimum current ratio,
tangible net worth, working capital, and total liabilities to
tangible net worth ratio all as defined in the Agreement, as
amended.   
The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all
assets of the Company.   
The term of the Agreement is for one year, with automatic
renewals for one year periods, except as otherwise provided
under the Agreement.   On August1, 2007, the Company entered into an amendment
Amendment to the above Agreement to provide an
additional $10million credit facility specifically for
acquisitions Acquisition Facility. Key terms of
the Amendment are summarized as follows   
$10,000 maximum aggregate commitment for acquisitions.   
Advances under the Acquisition Facility are not to exceed 80% of
purchase price or six times adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the
Amendment, for the twelve months immediately preceding the
acquisition closing date.   
Interest is payable at the rate of prime plus 2%.   
An acquisition commitment fee of 1% of the advance amount is
payable with one-eighth paid at closing and seven-eighths paid
with each loan funding.   
Repayment of each advance under the Acquisition Facility is
interest only for first year then amortizing for 36 to
48months, to be determined for each advance, with no
penalty to prepay any principal balance. The loan will also be
reduced annually by an amount equal to 25% of excess cash flow,
as defined in the Amendment, beginning December31, 2008.   
CPC may negotiate with the Company to revise existing financial
covenants in conjunction with each advance as required.   
Termination date of the senior credit facility was extended to
August1, 2009, subject to automatic renewal as defined in
the Amendment.   Inventory floor plan borrowings are reflected in accounts
payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, except
for $0 and $4,350 that is interest bearing and is reflected in
notes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at
December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, respectively.
Borrowings accrue interest at the prime rate 725% at
December31, 2007plus 05% on outstanding balances
that extend beyond the vendor approved free interest period. At
December31, 2007, INX was in compliance with the loan
covenants effective at that date and anticipates that it will be
able to comply with its loan covenants for the next twelve
months. In the event INX does not maintain compliance, it would
be required to seek waivers from CPC for those events, which, if
not obtained

of finance. At December31, 2007, INX had $32,519
outstanding on inventory floor plan finance borrowings, and the
unused availability was $3,005.   The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under all
credit line arrangements in effect during, 2007, 2006 and 2005
was 94%, 85% and 86%, respectively. The average amount of
borrowings under all credit line arrangements in effect during

management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which temporary differences, as determined pursuant to
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, become deductible. Management considers the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable
income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.
Managements evaluation of the realizability of deferred
tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence.
The weight given to the potential effects of positive and
negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be
objectively verified. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the
Company reversed the valuation allowance related to the net
operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items as the
Company determined it was now more likely than not that it would
be able to use the assets to reduce future tax liabilities. The
reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of
$535 in 2007 and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax
asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.   At December31, 2007, INX has a net operating loss NOL
carryforward for federal income tax return purposes of
approximately $5,650. Since United States tax laws limit the
time during which an NOL may be applied against future taxable
income and tax liabilities, INX may not be able to take full
advantage of its NOL carryforward for federal income tax
purposes. The carryforward will expire during the period 2023
through 2026 if not otherwise used. A change in ownership, as
defined by federal income tax regulations, could significantly
limit the companys ability to utilize its carryforward.   As a result of the adoption of SFAS123R, the Company
recognizes tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock
options directly to stockholders equity only when
realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized
for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax
benefits. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax
benefit realized upon an employees disposition of a
share-based award exceeds the cumulative book compensation
charge associated with the award. At December31, 2007,
windfall tax benefits included in NOL carryforward but not
reflected in deferred tax assets are $56million.

Adoption
of FASB Interpretation No48   Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No109 FIN48. FIN48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in an enterprises financial statements and
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This
Interpretation also provides related guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, and accounting in
interim periods and disclosure. The adoption of FIN48 did
not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December31, 2007.   The Company and its subsidiary file income tax returns in the
U.S.federal jurisdiction and several states. With few
exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to
U.S.federal or state and local income tax examinations by
tax authorities for years before 2003. The Company is currently
not undergoing an income tax examination in any jurisdiction.
The Company has not recorded a FIN48 liability as of
January1, 2007, the date of adoption.   There were no interest or penalties recorded for unrecognized
tax benefits for the year ended December31, 2007. There
were no interest or penalties accrued in the consolidated
balance sheets for the years ended December31, 2007 or

period IP communications solutions was the primary line of
business of the Company. Beginning in 2006, the Company used the
simplified method outlined in SAB107 to estimate expected
lives for options granted during the period. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the yield on zero-coupon
U.S.Treasury securities for a period that is commensurate
with the expected term assumption. The Company has not
historically issued any dividends and does not expect to in the
future.   Share-Based
Compensation Expense   The Company uses the straight-line attribution method to
recognize expense for unvested options. The amount of
share-based compensation recognized during a period is based on
the value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest.
SFAS123R requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time
of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Company will
re-evaluate the forfeiture rate annually and adjust it as
necessary, and the adjustments could be material.   Share-based compensation expense for stock options recognized
under SFAS123R for the years ended December31, 2007
and 2006 was as follows

to an employee at an exercise price of $001. The difference
between the exercise price and fair market value at date of
grant of $57 was charged to earnings during the year ended
December31, 2005, with a corresponding increase in
additional
paid-in-capital,
resulting in no impact on total stockholders equity. The
year ended December31, 2005 also included share-based
compensation expense of $5,729 resulting from the remeasurement
of stock options exchanged as part of the elimination of the
InterNetwork Experts, Inc. minority interest as discussed
further in Note12. Prior to January1, 2006, the
Company accounted for its share-based compensation under the
recognition and measurement principles of Accounting

arrangements granted under the Plan, which is expected to be
recognized over the weighted-average period of 39years.   On November10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3
Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects
of Share-Based Payment Awards. The Company has elected to
adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB
Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based
compensation pursuant to SFAS123R. The alternative
transition method includes simplified methods to establish the
beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool
APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee
stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact
on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of
the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that
are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS123R. SFAS123R
also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of
recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing
cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed
under the prior accounting rules. This requirement reduces net
operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in
periods after adoption. Total cash flow remains unchanged from
what would have been reported under prior accounting rules.
Since no tax benefit was recorded for share-based payment awards
in the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the
aforementioned provisions of SFAS123R and the related FASB
Staff Position
No.FAS123R-3
had no impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   Upon re-election to the Board of Directors in May 2007, INX
issued 9,072shares to its non-employee directors. The
issued shares were valued at $90 determined by multiplying the
shares issued by the closing price per share for the common
stock as reported by NASDAQ on May15, 2007.   Capital Stock Holders of INXs common
stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be
voted on by shareholders and are entitled to receive dividends,
if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of
Directors of INX the Board. Upon any liquidation
or dissolution of INX, the holders of common stock are entitled,
subject to any preferential rights of the holders of preferred
stock, to receive a pro rata share of all of the assets
remaining available for distribution to shareholders after
payment of all liabilities. There are no shares of preferred
stock issued or outstanding.   Common Stock Repurchase Plan Effective
December4, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
repurchase of up to $2,000 of the Companys common stock on
or before March31, 2008. These repurchases were required
to be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions
in compliance with
Rule10b-18
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject
to market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements
and other factors. The plan also requires the repurchased shares
to be retired as soon as practicable following the repurchase.
The plan did not obligate the Company to purchase any particular
amount of common stock and could be suspended at any time at the
Companys discretion. As of December31, 2007,
1,800shares were repurchased and settled for $18,
representing an average purchase price of $1008. Shares
repurchased at December31, 2007 and settled and recorded
in 2008 totaled 3,800 in the amount of $38, representing an
average purchase price of $1005.   
71 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   Warrants Included in the units issued by INX
on May7, 2004 were 575,000 warrants to purchase common
stock at an exercise price of $1245 per share. These warrants
are exercisable through May7, 2009 and are subject to
redemption by INX at a price of $025 per warrant upon
30days notice to the holders; however, INX may only redeem
the warrants if the closing price for INX common stock, as
reported on Nasdaq, for any five consecutive days has equaled or
exceeded $1660.   On May7, 2004 INX issued warrants to the underwriters to
purchase up to 50,000units at an exercise price equal to
$1992 per unit. These warrants are exercisable during the
four-year period beginning May7, 2005 which is one year
from the date of the prospectus. Pursuant to NASD
Rule2710g, these warrants cannot be sold, transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated by any person for a period of
one year following the effective date of the offering, except to
any NASD member participating in the offering, to bona fide
officers, by operation of law or if we are reorganized, so long
as the securities so transferred remain subject to the same
transfer restriction for the remainder of the one-year period.
The holder of the representatives warrant will have, in
that capacity, no voting, dividend or other stockholder rights.   In January 2007, INX issued warrants to an investor relations
firm under a personal services agreement to purchase up to
50,000shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to
$800 per share expiring January1, 2009. The warrants are
exercisable and resulted in a charge to 2007 earnings of $86,
which was reflected as an increase in selling, general, and
administrative expenses with a corresponding increase in
additional
paid-in-capital.
There was no impact on total stockholders equity.

Elimination
of Minority Interest in InterNetwork Experts, Inc.   On March18, 2005, the Company acquired all of the
InterNetwork Experts, Inc. shares held by a minority shareholder
group in exchange for 244,890shares of INX common stock.
The transaction was recorded using the purchase method of
accounting, resulting in recognition of goodwill of $1,408
including transaction costs of $180, elimination of $302 in
minority interests, and an increase in common stock and
additional
paid-in-capital
of $1,530. In connection with the transaction, InterNetwork
Experts, Inc. stock options were exchanged for INX stock
options, requiring remeasurement of the stock options as of the
date of exchange. The resulting $5,729 charge to 2005 earnings
was reflected as an increase in selling, general, and
administrative expenses with a corresponding increase in
additional
paid-in-capital
and therefore had no impact on total stockholders equity.

Major
Customers and Geographic Concentrations   International sales were approximately 37%, 49% and 35% of
consolidated revenues for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
based on the country in which the products were delivered or
services provided. No single customer represented more than 10%
of 2007 or 2006 consolidated revenues. The Company had one
customer, Micro System Enterprise, Inc./Acclaim Professional
Services MSE, an agent related to the Dallas
Independent School District
E-Rate
funded program that represented 128% of 2005 consolidated
revenue.

Related
Party Transactions   Under an agreement that expired on January31, 2007 the
Old Lease, the Company leased approximately
48,000square feet of office space from Allstar Equities,
Inc., Allstar, wholly-owned by Mr.James H.
Long, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and largest
shareholder. The office space was leased under the Old Lease at
the rate of $37 per month triple net. Due to the sale of the
Companys former Stratasoft and Valerent subsidiaries,
substantially less space was required by the Company at this
location. Accordingly, on October11, 2006, the Company
executed a new lease agreement New Lease with
Allstar effective February1, 2007, reducing the leased
space to 16,488square feet under the following terms   
A lease term of eighty-four months ending January31, 2014.   
72 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Base rent of $20 per month, gross. Under the Old Lease,
occupancy expenses such as electricity, gas, water, janitorial,
and security averaging approximately $280 per year are paid by
the Company. Under the New Lease these services are included in
the base rent with the costs born by the landlord.   
A buildout allowance of $31 to be used by the Company to
partially offset the costs of remodeling the leased premises and
first floor common areas. The buildout allowance was provided by
reducing the monthly lease payment from $21 to $20.   
A security deposit of $20 is required, which is a reduction from
the $38 currently held by Allstar.   
The Company has the option to terminate the lease at the end of
the sixtieth or seventy-second month of the lease term. In order
to exercise its option, the Company is required to provide
Allstar with a minimum of 180days advance written notice
of its intent to terminate the lease. If 360days of
advance written notice is given by the Company, a termination
fee of one months base rent is immediately payable, and if
180days of advance written notice is given by the Company,
a termination fee of two months base rent is immediately
payable.   
At any time during the term of the lease, Allstar has the right
to pay the Company in cash the amount of unamortized buildout
allowance, after which the monthly basic rent payable under the
lease increases from $20 to $21 for the remaining term of the
lease.   
The Company has the option to renew the lease for two additional
terms of five years each at the lesser of the then prevailing
fair market rental rate or 105% of the base rent under the New
Lease.   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors engaged the
services of an independent real estate consultant to evaluate
the fair market rental and related lease terms for comparable
facilities in Houston. Based on the recommendations of the
independent consultant the Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the transactions contemplated by the New
Lease.   On January25, 2008, Allstar sold the building and rights
under the Lease to the General Consulate of Equatorial Guinea
Consulate, an unrelated third party. In connection
with the sale of the building, INX, Allstar and Consulate
executed a First Amendment to INX Inc. Lease Agreement
Amendment on January22, 2008, which included
the following terms   
INX has the sole option to terminate its lease with
120days notice for reasons specified in the Amendment. INX
is not required to pay rent during the 120day notice
period.   
INX has the right of first refusal on additional space on the
second floor of the building.   The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and
approved the related party transaction contemplated by the
Amendment.   Rental expense under the lease agreements with Allstar for the
years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled
approximately $257, $446, and $446, respectively. The Company
paid for remodeling, parking lot repaving, and other
improvements of the building leased from Allstar totaling $106,
$267, and $8 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The Audit Committee of the Board of
Directors approved the 2006 expenditures. Under the transition
to the new lease, sublease income earned by Allstar prior to
expiration of the current lease is payable to the Company. At
December31, 2006, a $26 sublease income receivable from
Allstar was recorded in the accompanying balance sheet, which
was paid to the Company in 2007.   
15.
Commitments
and Contingencies   Litigation The Company served as a
subcontractor to Complete Communications Services, Inc.
CoCom, a subcontractor on certain school district
contracts during 2007. On August24, 2007, CoCom filed a
Chapter11 Petition in U.S.Bankruptcy Court. As of
December31, 2007, the Company has accounts receivable from
CoCom of   
73 Table of Contents   INX INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   $325, less an allowance for doubtful accounts of $250. The
remaining net accounts receivable of $75 is covered by a
subcontractor bond, under which the Company has filed a lawsuit
against the surety for payment. The Company received payments of
$102 during the ninety day period preceding the bankruptcy
filing which could potentially be deemed preferential. Further
developments with regard to the Companys claims against
the sureties on bonds other than the subcontractor bond and
continuing developments in the Bankruptcy Court proceedings
resulted in the Companys decision to increase the
allowance for doubtful accounts, recording a charge to earnings
of $154 during the fourth quarter of 2007. While the results of
litigation with the surety and potential preference claims
cannot be predicted with certainty, INX believes the final
outcome of such matters will not have a materially adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position.   On January24, 2008, Schneider Rucinski Enterprises filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court Southern District of
California styled Schneider Rucinski Enterprisesv.
Touch Asia Outsourcing Solutions, Stratasoft, Inc., INX Inc.,
etal claiming damages of $555 and other relief. On
February19, 2008, INX filed its motion to dismiss
complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or, in the
alternative, to dismiss for failure to state a claim; memorandum
of points and authorities in support thereof. INX cannot predict
the final outcome of this matter, including whether it could
have a materially adverse effect on its results of operations or
financial position.   INX is also party to other litigation and claims which
management believes are normal in the course of its operations.
While the results of such litigation and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, INX believes the final outcome of such
matters will not have a materially adverse effect on its results
of operations or financial position.   Leases Rent expense for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled approximately
$1,404, $1,111, and $1,101, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments on noncancellable operating leases with remaining
terms in excess of one year amount to approximately $1,282 in
2008, $1,274 in 2009, $869 in 2010, $517 in 2011, $449 in 2012,
and $551 thereafter.   Obligation under Software License Agreement
Base payments of $612 in 2008 are required under a three year
software license agreement expiring December14, 2009.
Supplemental fees may be payable under the software license
agreement based on actual network devices utilizing the
software. Supplemental fees will be expensed as incurred.   401k Plan INX maintains a 401k savings
plan wherein it matches a portion of the employee contribution.
In addition, there is a discretionary matching fund based on the
net profitability of INX. All full-time employees who have
completed 90days of service with INX are eligible to
participate in the plan. Declaration of the discretionary
portion of the matching fund is the decision of the Board. INX
has made no additional contributions to the plan for the three
years ended December31, 2007. Under the standard plan
matching program, INXs expense was $80, $86 and $54 for
the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.

Controls
and Procedures   Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   Under the supervision and with the participation of certain
members of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we completed an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e
and
15d-15e to
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, we and our
management have concluded that, our disclosure controls and
procedures at December31, 2007 were effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in these
reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.   We will consider further actions and continue to evaluate the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls
and procedures on an ongoing basis, taking corrective action as
appropriate. Management does not expect that disclosure controls
and procedures or internal controls can prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and
operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. While management believes
that its disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that fraud can be detected and prevented, because of
the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.   Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   During the fourth quarter of 2007, there has been no change in
our internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.   Managements
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in
Rule13a-15f
of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In conducting
its evaluation, our management used the criteria set forth by
the framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management
believes our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2007.   The certifications of INXs Principal Executive Officer and
Principal Financial Officer attached as Exhibits311 and
312 to this Annual Report on
Form10-K
include, in paragraph4 of such certifications, information
concerning INXs disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls over financial reporting. Such certifications
should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
this Item9AT for a more complete understanding of the
matters covered by such certifications.   This annual report does not include an attestation report of the
Companys registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting. Managements
report was not subject to attestation by the Companys
registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company
to provide only managements report in this annual report.
