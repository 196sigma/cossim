Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Business Brightpoint, Inc. the Company is a global leader in the distribution of wireless devices and
accessories and provision of customized logistic services to the wireless industry including
wireless network operators also referred to as mobile operators, Mobile Virtual Network
Operators MVNOs and manufacturers with operations centers and/or sales offices in various
countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia,
Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.
The Company provides integrated logistic services including procurement, inventory management,
software loading, kitting and customized packaging, fulfillment, credit services and receivables
management, call center and activation services, website hosting, e-fulfillment solutions and other
services within the global wireless industry. The Companys customers include mobile operators,
MVNOs, resellers, retailers and wireless equipment manufacturers. The Company distributes wireless
communication devices and provides value-added distribution and logistic services for wireless
products manufactured by companies such as High Tech Computer Corp., Kyocera, LG Electronics,
Motorola, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens, Sony Ericsson and UTStarcom. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana in August1989 under the name
Wholesale Cellular USA, Inc. and reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in March
1994. In September1995, the Company changed its name to Brightpoint, Inc. In June2004, the
Company reincorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana under the name of Brightpoint, Inc. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all
of which are wholly-owned with the exception of the Moobi Norway A/S subsidiary that is 76% owned
by the Company. On July31, 2007 the Company completed its acquisition of Dangaard Telecom. Results
of operations related to this acquisition are included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations beginning on August1, 2007. See Note 3 for further
details regarding this acquisition. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial
statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an
on-going basis, the Company reviews its estimates and assumptions. The Companys estimates were
based on its historical experience and various other assumptions that the Company believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates under
different assumptions or conditions, but management does not believe such differences will
materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB104, Revenue
Recognition. Revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer,
there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. The
amount of revenue is determined based on either the gross method or the net method. The amount
under the gross method includes the value of the product sold while the amount under the net method
does not include the value of the product sold. For distribution revenue, which is recorded using the gross method, the criteria of SAB 104 are
generally met upon shipment to customers, including title transfer; and therefore, revenue is
recognized at the time of shipment. In some circumstances, the customer may take legal title and
assume risk of loss upon delivery; and therefore, revenue is recognized on the delivery date. In
certain countries, title is retained by the Company for collection purposes only, which does not
impact the timing of 54 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements revenue recognition in accordance with the provisions of SAB 104. Sales are
recorded net of discounts, rebates, returns and
allowances. The Company does not have any material post-shipment obligations e.g. customer
acceptance or other arrangements. A portion of the Companys sales involves shipments of products directly from its suppliers to its
customers. In such circumstances, the Company negotiates the price with the supplier and the
customer, assumes responsibility for the delivery of the product and, at times, takes the ownership
risk while the product is in transit, pays the supplier directly for the product shipped,
establishes payment terms and bears credit risk of collecting payment from its customers. In
addition, the Company bears responsibility for accepting returns of products from the customer in
these arrangements. Under these arrangements, the Company serves as the principal with the
customer, as defined by Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross
as a Principal versus Net as an Agent, and therefore recognizes the sale and cost of sale of the
product upon receiving notification from the supplier that the product has shipped or in cases of
FOB destination, CIP destination, or similar terms, the Company recognizes the sales upon
confirmation of delivery to the customer at the named destination. For logistic services revenue, the criteria of SAB 104 are met when the Companys logistic services
have been performed and, therefore, revenue is recognized at that time. In general, logistic
services are fee-based services. The Company has certain arrangements for which it records
receivables, inventory and payables based on the gross amount of the transactions; however, the
Company records revenue for these logistic services at the amount of net margin because it is
acting as an agent for mobile operators as defined by EITF 99-19. The Company also records revenue
from the sale of prepaid airtime within logistic services. In certain circumstances, the Company
recognizes revenue for the sales of prepaid airtime using the gross method based on the full sales
price of the airtime to its customers because the Company has general inventory risk, latitude in
setting price and other gross reporting indicators as defined by EITF 99-19. If all of the
Companys prepaid airtime transactions that are currently recorded using the gross method were
accounted for using the net method, logistic services revenue would have been lower by $902
million, $1217million and $1367million for 2007, 2006 and 2005. In other logistic services arrangements, the Company receives activation commissions for acquiring
subscribers on behalf of mobile operators through its independent dealer/agents. In the event
activation occurs through an independent dealer/agent, a portion of the commission is passed on to
the dealer/agent. These arrangements may contain provisions for additional residual commissions
based on subscriber usage. These agreements may also provide for the reduction or elimination of
activation commissions if subscribers deactivate service within stipulated periods. The Company
recognizes revenue for activation commissions upon activation of the subscribers service and
residual commissions when earned. An allowance is established for estimated wireless service
deactivations as a reduction of accounts receivable and revenues. In circumstances where the
Company is acting as an agent for mobile operators as defined by EITF 99-19, the Company recognizes
the revenue using the net method. Performance penalty clauses may be included in certain contracts
whereby the Company provides logistic services. In general, these penalties are in the form of
reduced per unit fees or a specific dollar amount. In the event the Company has incurred
performance penalties, revenues are reduced accordingly within each calendar month. Gross Profit The Company determines its gross profit as the difference between revenue and cost of revenue. Cost
of revenue includes the direct product costs and other costs such as freight, labor and rent
expense. Vendor Programs The Company has three major types of incentive arrangements with various suppliers: price
protection, volume incentive rebates, and marketing, training and promotional funds. The Company
follows EITF 02-16, Accounting by a Customer Including a Reseller for Certain Consideration
Received from a Vendor and EITF 03-10, Application of Issue No02-16 by Resellers to Sales
Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers, in accounting for vendor programs. To the extent
that the Company receives excess funds from suppliers for reimbursement of its costs, the Company
recognizes the excess as a liability due to the supplier, which is applied to future costs incurred
on behalf of the supplier.   
Price protection: consideration is received from certain, but not all, suppliers in the
form of a credit memo based on market conditions as determined by the supplier. The amount is
determined based on the difference between original purchase price from the supplier and
revised list price from the supplier. The terms of the price protection varies by supplier and
product, but is typically less than one month from original date of purchase. This amount is
accrued as a reduction of trade accounts payable until a credit memo is received and applied
as a debit to the outstanding accounts 55 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements payable. This same amount is either a reduction of inventory cost or is a reduction of cost of
sales for those wireless devices already sold.   
Volume incentive rebates: consideration is received from certain suppliers when purchase or
sell-through targets are attained or exceeded within a specified time period. The amount of
rebate earned in any financial reporting period is accrued as a vendor receivable, which is
classified as a reduction of trade accounts payable. This same amount is either a reduction of
inventory cost or is a reduction of cost of sales for those devices already sold. In certain
markets, the amount of the rebate is determined based on actual volumes purchased for the
incentive period to date at the established rebate percentage without minimum volume purchase
requirements. In other markets, where the arrangement has a tiered rate structure for
increasing volumes, the rate of the rebate accrual is determined based on the actual volumes
purchased plus reasonable, predictable estimates of future volumes within the incentive
period. In the event the future volumes are not reasonably estimable, the Company records the
incentive at the conclusion of the rebate period or at the point in time when the volumes are
reasonably estimable. Upon expiration of the rebate period an adjustment is recognized through
inventory or cost of sales for devices already sold if there is any variance between estimated
rebate receivable and actual rebate earned. To the extent that the Company passes-through
rebates to its customers, the amount is recognized as a liability in the period that it is
probable and reasonably estimable.   
Marketing, training and promotional funds: consideration is received from certain suppliers
for cooperative arrangements related to market development, training and special promotions
agreed upon in advance. The amount received is generally in the form of a credit memo, which
is applied to trade accounts payable. The same amount is recorded as a current liability.
Expenditures made pursuant to the agreed upon activity reduce this liability. To the extent
that the Company incurs costs in excess of the established supplier fund, the Company
recognizes the amount as a selling expense. Cash and Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased are
considered to be cash equivalents. Pledged cash represents cash reserved as collateral for letters
of credit issued by financial institutions on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries and as
collateral for vendor credit. Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of trade accounts receivable. These receivables are generated from product sales and
services provided to mobile operators, agents, resellers, dealers and retailers in the global
wireless industry and are dispersed throughout the world, including North America, Latin America,
Asia, the Pacific Rim and Europe. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers
and provides credit in the normal course of business to a large number of its customers. However,
consistent with industry practice, the Company does not generally require collateral from its
customers to secure trade accounts receivable. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, Generation Next Group formerly Computech, a customer of the Companys
Singapore operations 2007and the Companys Brightpoint Asia Limited operations 2006 and 2005,
accounted for approximately 10%, 13% and 12% of the Companys total revenue and 29%, 29% and 23% of
the Asia-Pacific divisions revenue. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there were no amounts owed to
the Company from Generation Next Group. The loss or a significant reduction in business activities
by the Companys customers could have a material adverse affect on the Companys revenue and
results of operations. The Company is primarily dependent upon wireless equipment manufacturers for its supply of wireless
voice and data equipment. Revenue from the sale of Nokia products represented approximately 38 47% and 52% of total revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005. The Company is dependent on the ability of its
suppliers to provide an adequate supply of products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing
terms. The loss of certain principal suppliers or a significant reduction in product availability
from principal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company also
relies on its suppliers to provide trade credit facilities and favorable payment terms to
adequately fund its on-going operations and product purchases. In certain circumstances, the
Company has issued cash-secured letters of credit on behalf of certain of its subsidiaries in
support of their vendor credit facilities. The payment terms received from the Companys suppliers
is dependent on several factors, including, but not limited to, the Companys payment history with
the supplier, the suppliers credit granting policies, contractual provisions, the Companys
overall credit rating as determined by various credit rating agencies, the Companys recent
operating results, financial position and cash flows and the suppliers ability to obtain credit
insurance on amounts that the Company owes them. Adverse changes in any of these factors, certain
of which may not be wholly in the Companys control, could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys operations. The Company believes 56 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements that its relationships with its suppliers are
satisfactory; however, it has periodically experienced inadequate supply of certain models from
certain wireless device manufacturers. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable on an on-going basis. In
circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial
obligations, the Company records a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net
recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. For all
other customers, the Company recognizes allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of
time the receivables are past due, the current business environment and the Companys historical
experience. In certain circumstances, the Company has obtained credit insurance to mitigate its
credit risk. Inventories Inventories primarily consist of wireless devices and accessories and are stated at the lower of
cost first-in, first-out method or market. Freight expense is capitalized for inventory held in
stock and expensed at the time the inventory is sold. At each balance sheet date, the Company
evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence, considering any stock
balancing or rights of return that it may have with certain suppliers. This evaluation includes
analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand. The Company writes off
inventories that are considered obsolete. Remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate
the lower of cost or market. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no
individually significant inventory valuation adjustments. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts at December31, 2007 and 2006, of cash and cash equivalents, pledged cash,
accounts receivable, contract financing receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued
expenses and contract financing payables approximate their fair values because of the short
maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount at December31, 2007 and 2006 of the Companys
borrowings approximate their fair value because these borrowings bear interest at a variable
marketrate. The Company has $85million of marketable securities classified as available-for-sale as of
December31, 2007. During 2007, the Company acquired 470,000 shares representing 91% of the total
outstanding shares of common stock of Tessco Technologies Incorporated Tessco. The shares were
purchased because the Company believed that the shares were currently undervalued in the
marketplace and represent an attractive investment opportunity. The shares have a fair value of
approximately $85million as of December31, 2007 and are included in Other current assets in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has approximately $12million of unrealized gains
included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity. The Company enters into derivative instruments through purchase of forward contracts to reduce, not
eliminate, unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency
exchange rates. The Company also enters into derivative instruments through purchase of forward
contracts to pay vendors who invoice the Company in a non-functional currency. The fair value of
these instruments is reported as a current asset or current liability in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities; and
therefore, changes in fair value of these instruments are included as a component of Other
incomeexpenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its borrowing arrangements. The
Companys risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market
volatility may have on interest expense. The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage interest
rate exposure. At December31, 2007, swaps with a total notional amount of $650million were
outstanding. These swaps have maturity dates ranging from 2009-2012. These derivative instruments
are designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133. Changes in market value, when effective, are
recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Amounts are recorded to interest expense as settled. A 10% increase in short-term borrowing rates
during the quarter would have resulted in an immaterial increase in interest expense. The fair
value liability associated with those swaps was $16million at December31, 2007 and is included
as a component of Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has
approximately $16 57 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements million of unrealized losses included as a component of Accumulated other
comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of
Shareholders Equity. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are stated at cost and depreciated ratably
over the shorter of the lease term of the associated property or the estimated life of the
leasehold improvement. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company follows the principles of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. The Company periodically considers whether indicators of impairment of
long-lived tangible and finite-lived intangible assets are present. If such indicators are present,
the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the
assets in question is less than their carrying value. If less, the Company recognizes an impairment
loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values.
Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods. If the
assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used, the Company recognizes an impairment
charge to the extent the assets carrying value is greater than the present value of anticipated
future cash flows attributable to the asset. The fair value of the asset then becomes the assets
new carrying value, which, if applicable, the Company depreciates or amortizes over the remaining
estimated useful life of the asset. At December31, 2007 and 2006, the finite-lived intangible
assets total $1354million and $12million, net of accumulated amortization of $122million and
$15million and are currently being amortized over three to fifteen years. See Note 3 for further
discussion regarding the finite-lived intangible assets acquired during 2007. For the years ended
December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred no impairment charges for these long-lived
tangible and finite-lived intangible assets. The following sets forth amortization expense for
finite-lived intangible assets the Company expects to recognize over the next five years in

As discussed in Note 3, the Company decided to cease Dangaard Telecoms implementation of SAP
enterprise resource planning and related software. As part of that decision, the Company determined
that costs capitalized related to the project in the period after the acquisition of Dangaard
Telecom were impaired under SFAS 144. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $71million was
recorded in the Companys Europe division and is included within Restructuring charges in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December31, 2007. For the year ended December31, 2005, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately
$23million to write-down certain intangible assets in connection with the Companys decision to
sell its operations in France. This impairment charge is included as a component of Loss from
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Goodwill The Company follows the principles of SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is
not amortized but rather tested annually for impairment. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of approximately $115million as a result of its decision to sell
its operations in France. This impairment charge is included as a component of Loss from
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In the fourth quarter of
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company performed the required annual impairment test on its goodwill and
incurred no additional impairment charges. The Companys reporting units are contained within
three geographic segments, the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific as defined under SFAS 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Based on the fact that each
reporting unit constitutes a business, has discrete financial information with similar economic
characteristics, and the operating results of the component are regularly reviewed by management,
the Company applies the provisions of SFAS 142 and performs the necessary goodwill impairment tests
at the reporting unit level. As
permitted under SFAS 142, the Companys determination of the fair value of Dangaard Telecom
for use in its annual impairment analysis was carried forward from
the fair value used to determine the purchase price of Dangaard
Telecom, as discussed in Note 3. 58 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.

Foreign Currency Translation The functional currency for most of the Companys foreign subsidiaries is the respective local
currency. Revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar
at average exchange rates in effect during the period, and assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at the exchange rate in effect at the end of
the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as a component of Other incomeexpenses. Currency translation of
assets and liabilities foreign investments from the functional currency to the U.S. dollar are
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the Consolidated Statement of Shareholders Equity. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of
events that have been recognized in the Companys financial statements or income tax returns.
Income taxes are recognized during the year in which the underlying transactions are reflected in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences
between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and amounts
recorded for tax purposes. After determining the total amount of deferred tax assets, the Company
determines whether it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not
be realized. If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized, a
valuation allowance will be established against that asset to record it at its expected realizable
value. The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is
greater than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period, and diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during each period. Per share
amounts for all periods presented in this report have been adjusted to reflect the 6 for 5 common
stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on May31, 2006 and the 3 for 2 common
stock splits effected in the form of stock dividends paid on September30, 2005 and December30,
2005. The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted
earnings per share computations in thousands, except per share data 59 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.

At December31, 2007, approximately 02million stock options and restricted stock units were
excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share because the effect of including these
shares would have been anti-dilutive to diluted earnings per share. The Company excluded 3,000,000 shares held in escrow issued in connection with the purchase of
Dangaard Telecom from the weighted average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share until
the end of the escrow period as required under the treasury stock method. The weighted average
impact of the 3,000,000 shares held in escrow is included reconciliation to the calculation of
weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141R. This statement amends SFAS 141, Business
Combinations, and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and
goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. It also
provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature
and financial effects of the business combination. The provisions of SFAS 141R are effective for
the Company on January1, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141R to have a
material impact on its financial statements. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements An Amendment of ARB No51. This Statement amends ARB 51 to establish accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. It clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest
in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial
statements. The provisions of SFAS 160 are effective for the Company on January1, 2009. Based on
the conditions that existed as of December31, 2007, the Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 160 to have a material impact on its financial statements. In February2007, FASB issued SFAS 159, the Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting, but does not affect existing
standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value. Under SFAS 159, a
company may elect to use fair value to measure financial instruments and certain other items, which
may reduce the need to apply complex hedge accounting provisions in order to mitigate volatility in
reported earnings. The fair value election is irrevocable and is generally made on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to
measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses on existing items
for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained
earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.
The provisions of SFAS 60 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 159 are effective for the Company on January1, 2008. Based on the
conditions that existed as of December31, 2007, the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS
159 to have a material impact on its financial statements. In September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASBissued SFAS 157, Fair Value
Measurements. This Statement defines fair value and provides guidance for how to measure fair
value. SFAS 157 applies to assets and liabilities required or permitted to be measured at fair
value under other accounting pronouncements; however, this Statement does not provide guidance
whether assets and liabilities are required or permitted to be measured at fair value. The
provisions of SFAS 157 are effective for the Company on January1, 2008 for financial assets and
liabilities and January1, 2009 for non-financial assets and liabilities. Based on the conditions
that existed as of December31, 2007, the Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have
a material impact on its financial statements. In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109, which clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation requires the recognition of a tax position when
it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by relevant
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company adopted the
provisions of FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. The adoption of this statement did not have a
material impact on its financial statements. Operating Segments The Company has operations centers and/or sales offices in various countries including Australia,
Austria, Belgium, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United States. All
of the Companys operating entities generate revenue from the distribution of wireless devices and
accessories and/or the provision of logistic services. The Company identifies its reportable
segments based on management responsibility of its three geographic divisions: the Americas,
Asia-Pacific and Europe. The Companys operating segments have been aggregated into these three
geographic reporting segments. The Company evaluates the performance of and allocates resources to these segments based on
operating income from continuing operations excluding corporate selling, general and
administrative expenses and other unallocated expenses. Previously, the Companys measurement of
segment profit included allocated corporate selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment
information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. A
summary of the Companys operations by segment is presented below in thousands for 2007, 2006 and

The Company has equity compensation plans, which reserve shares of common stock for issuance to
executives, key employees, directors and others. Amended 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan During 2004, the Companys shareholders approved the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTI Plan
whereby officers, other key employees of the Company and others are eligible to be granted
non-qualified incentive stock options, performance units, restricted stock, other stock-based
awards, and/or cash awards. No participant may be granted under the LTI Plan, during any year,
options or any other awards relating to more than 20million shares of common stock in the
aggregate. During 2007, the Companys shareholders approved an amendment to the LTI Plan which
removed a limitation on the number of shares that are subject to non-option awards. Previously, the
LTI Plan limited the number of shares that can be the subject of non-option based awards under the
plan to 20million shares. There are 41million common shares reserved for issuance under 63 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the LTI
Plan, of which approximately 26million and 30million were authorized but unissued at December
31, 2007 and 2006. Under this LTI Plan, 15million shares remain available for grant as of
December31, 2007. For the above plans, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors
determines the times at which the grants will be awarded, selects the officers or other
recipients of awards and determines the number of shares covered by each grant, as well as, the
purchase price, time of exercise of options not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant
and other terms and conditions. The Board of Directors has delegated authority to the Companys
Chief Executive Officer to grant up to approximately 06million of awards to non-officer employees
per calendar year. Amended and Restated Independent Director Stock Compensation Plan During 2004, the Companys shareholders approved an Amended and Restated Independent Director Stock
Compensation Plan the Director Stock Compensation Plan, pursuant to which 24million shares of
common stock are reserved for issuance to non-employee directors, of which approximately 22 were
authorized but unissued at December31, 2007 and 2006. The Director Stock Compensation Plan
provides for Initial Awards, consisting of restricted shares of the Companys common stock granted
to an Independent Director when he or she joins the Board; Annual Awards, consisting of up to an
aggregate of 5,400 restricted shares of the Companys common stock granted to all Independent
Directors on an annual basis; and Elective Awards, consisting of an award of restricted shares of
the Companys common stock equal to a percentage of the Independent Directors board compensation,
which are paid in June and December of each year. Effective January1, 2008, the Companys Corporate Governance Principles were amended by unanimous
written consent of the Board of Directors of the Company to eliminate the previous requirement that
50% of each Independent Directors annual compensation be paid in common stock unless a threshold
amount of share holdings equal to 200% of annual Board compensation
has already been attained.
Accordingly, the directors fees will be paid entirely in the form of an annual cash retainer
beginning in 2008. Stock Options The exercise price of stock options granted under the LTI Plan may not be less than the fair market
value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options generally become exercisable in
periods ranging from one to three years after the date of the grant. For the year ended December
31, 2007, the Company granted 73,745 stock options with a weighted average fair value of $475

The weighted average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2006 and 2005 was $1994
and $829 per share. The weighted average fair value of restricted stock awards granted during 2006 and 2005 was $2106
and $752 per share. The Company typically grants performance based equity awards during the first quarter of the fiscal
year. A portion of the restricted stock units granted are subject to forfeiture if certain
performance goals are not achieved. Those restricted stock 65 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements units no longer subject to forfeiture
typically vest in three equal annual installments beginning with the first anniversary of the
grant. The total intrinsic value of options exercised and restricted stock released vestedduring 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $75million, $250million and $204million. As of December31, 2007, total
compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized was $143million of which
approximately one-third will be recognized in each of the next three fiscal years. In addition, the
Company will recognize compensation expense for any new awards granted subsequent to December31,
2007. 3. Acquisitions On March30, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of
certain liabilities related to the U.S. operations and the Miami-based Latin America business of
CellStar Corporation for $675million including direct acquisition costs. Results of operations
related to this acquisition have been included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations beginning in the second quarter of 2007. On July31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Dangaard Telecom, a Danish company from Dangaard Holding A/S Dangaard Holding, a
Danish company for a purchase price of i $100,000 in cash and ii30,000,000 shares of the
Companys unregistered common stock including 3,000,000 shares held in escrow. In addition, the
Company assumed approximately $3487million of Dangaard Telecoms indebtedness. The acquisition of
Dangaard Telecom expanded the Companys existing European operations as Dangaard Telecom was the
leading distributor of wireless devices and accessories in Europe. The purchase price for the Dangaard Telecom acquisition was $3111million including direct
acquisition costs. The fair value of the Companys common stock was measured in accordance with
EITF99-12, Determination of the Measurement Date for the Market Price of Acquirer Securities
Issued in a Purchase Business Combination. Total equity consideration was estimated using a stock
price of $1125 per share, which represents the average closing stock price beginning two trading
days before and ending two trading days after February20, 2007, the date of the public
announcement of the definitive purchase agreement. The allocation of the purchase price is based
upon preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Results of
operations related to this acquisition are included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations beginning on August1, 2007. The Company is in the process of finalizing its valuation of certain assets and liabilities of
Dangaard Telecom primarily related to the determination of amounts that will be paid in connection
with consolidating certain facilities. Prior to the completion of the acquisition of Dangaard
Telecom, Company management began formulating a plan to exit certain activities of the combined
company. Components of this preliminary plan included terminating Dangaard Telecoms implementation
of SAP enterprise resource planning ERPand related software and consolidating certain
facilities. As Company management finalizes the plan, additional liabilities may result primarily
related to involuntary employee termination costs and costs to exit certain facilities in our
Europe operations. These additional liabilities will be recognized as liabilities assumed in the
business combination and included in the allocation of the acquisition costs in accordance with
EITF 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchased Business Combination. A plan
is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2008. Adjustments to the purchase price
allocation under the preliminary plan resulted in reductions of assets acquired of $167million
and additional liabilities assumed of $27million. In the process of finalizing its valuation, the
Company excluded the fair value of the 3,000,000 shares held in escrow from the total purchase
price as the Company believes there is a more than remote possibility that some or all of the
shares will be returned. The Dangaard Telecom assets acquired included $1231million of finite-lived intangible assets
assigned to the customer relationships. The preparation of the valuation of finite-lived intangible
assets required the use of significant assumptions and estimates. Critical estimates included, but
were not limited to future expected cash flows and the applicable discount rates as of the date of
the acquisition. These estimates were based on assumptions that the Company believed to be
reasonable as of the date of acquisition; however, actual results may differ from these estimates.
The acquired finite-lived intangible assets have a useful life of approximately fifteen years and
are being amortized over the period that the assets are expected to contribute to the future cash
flows of the Company. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated
method based on the projected cash flows used for valuation purposes. As a result of applying this
accelerated method of amortization, approximately 53% of the original value assigned to these
assets will be amortized within the first five years after the acquisition date. The Company
believes that these cash flows are most reflective of the pattern in which the economic benefit of
the finite-lived intangible assets will be consumed. For the year ended December31, 2007 66 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements approximately $83million of amortization expense related to the acquired finite-lived intangible
assets was included in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. The following balance sheets set forth the major assets acquired and liabilities assumed in

Various factors contributed to the goodwill recorded in connection with the CellStar and Dangaard
Telecom acquisitions, including the value of assembled workforces of the respective business at the
acquisition dates; the future revenue growth from increased market penetration and new customers;
and expected synergies. The goodwill recorded in connection with the Dangaard Telecom acquisition
is generally not deductible for tax purposes. However, the goodwill acquired in connection with the
CellStar transaction is deductible for tax purposes. The CellStar goodwill has been assigned to the
Americas reportable segment. The goodwill related to the Dangaard Telecom acquisition has been
assigned primarily to the Companys Europe reportable segment. The following sets forth unaudited pro forma financial information in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States assuming each of the acquisitions discussed
above took place at the beginning of each period presented. The unaudited pro forma results include

The effective tax rate decreased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a $141million benefit related
to the reversal of valuation allowances on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards as well as a
$21million benefit resulting from a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Germany. Based on
taxable income and utilization of prior net operating loss carryforwards, it became more likely
than not during the second quarter of 2007 that the Company will be able to utilize these foreign
tax credits prior to their expiration. Significant components of the provision for income tax expense benefitfrom continuing operations

Income tax payments for continuing operations were $ 147million, $46million and $66million in
2007, 2006 and 2005. At December31, 2007, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$734million of which $12million expire between 2008 and 2011 and $722million have no
expiration date. The Company also has U.S. foreign tax credits of $141million of which $127
million expire during 2012 and $14million expire between 2013 and 2015. The Company determined
that a portion of the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards is not likely
to be realized, and a valuation allowance has been established against that asset to record it at
its expected realizable value. Undistributed earnings of the Companys foreign operations were
approximately $680million at December31, 2007. Those earnings are generally considered to be
indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes or
foreign withholding taxes has been made. Upon distribution of those earnings, the Company would be
subject to U.S. income taxes subject to a reduction for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes
payable to the various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S.
income tax liability is not practical. In July2006, the FASB issued FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation
of FASB Statement No109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. The
provisions of FIN 48 became effective for the Company on January1, 2007. This Interpretation
requires the recognition of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of
the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater
than 50percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The adoption of FIN 48 did not
have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. As of the date of adoption, the
Companys unrecognized tax benefits totaled $22million $01 in interest and $21million of tax
positions, which if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Interest costs and penalties
related to income taxes are classified as tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest and
penalties at December31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $01million and $01million
respectively. Interest recognized as part of the Companys provision for income taxes was not
material in 2007. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits

all the equity securities of Brightpoint France SARL Brightpoint France to an entity formed by
the former managing director of Brightpoint France. Consideration for the sale consisted of a
loan receivable from the purchaser of which the Company received approximately $05million during
2006 and $07million during 2007 including interest. The remaining face value of the loan
receivable from the purchaser at December31, 2007 was approximately $06million and is due in
December2008. The Company recorded a loss from the sale of approximately $22million,
representing the difference between the carrying value of Brightpoint France and the fair value of
consideration received. During the third quarter of 2005, the Company recorded impairment charges
in connection with its plan to sell Brightpoint France, including a $138million non-cash
impairment charge to the value of goodwill and other intangible assets, which is included in Loss
from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Brightpoint France was

located in Denmark for which the initial lease term expires in 2018. The minimum lease
payments increase every three years on the Plainfield lease agreement. The Company recognizes
rent expense on a straight-line basis, which results in deferred rent during the portion of
the lease term in which payments are less than the expense recognized. As a result, the
Company has a deferred rent liability for the Plainfield lease of $57million and $56

foreign guarantors, and vincreased commitments, in certain cases, from existing members of the
bank group, and new commitments from other lenders who became new members of the bank group upon
the closing of the First Amendment. The Global Credit Facility and the Global Term Loans bear interest at a base rate plus an
adjustment based on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. The base rate for borrowings
denominated in US Dollars under the Global Credit Facility is the higher of athe Federal Funds
Rate plus 050% or bthe rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time
to time by Bank of America as its prime rate. The base rate for borrowings denominated in Euros
under the Global Credit Facility is LIBOR. The weighted average interest rate at December31, 2007
was approximately 68%. At December31, 2007, the Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with the covenants in
each of its credit agreements. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, interest
expense, which approximates cash payments of interest, was $201million, $23million and $12
million. Interest expense includes interest on outstanding debt, fees paid for unused capacity on
credit lines and amortization of deferred financing fees. Principal payments on the debt discussed above, excluding the effects of permitted prepayments
which may be made under the Credit Agreement, for the next five years are expected to be as follows

9. Guarantees In accordance with FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, guarantees are recorded at fair value and
disclosed, even when the likelihood of making any payments under such guarantees is remote. In some circumstances, the Company purchases inventory with payment terms requiring letters of
credit. As of December31, 2007, the Company has issued $233million in standby letters of credit.
These standby letters of credit are generally issued for a one-year term and are supported by
availability under the Companys credit facilities. The underlying obligations for which these
letters of credit have been issued are recorded in the financial statements at their full value.
Should the Company fail to pay its obligation to one or all of these suppliers, the suppliers may
draw on the standby letter of credit issued for them. As of December31, 2007, the maximum future
payments under these letters of credit are $233million. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, to the
extent permitted by law, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to reimburse its officers and
directors for legal expenses in the event of litigation and regulatory matters. The terms of these
indemnification agreements provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments. The
Company has a directors and officers insurance policy that may, in certain instances, mitigate the
potential liability and payments. Late in 2004, the Company entered into a non-exclusive agreement to distribute wireless devices in
Europe for a certain supplier. Subject to this agreement, the Company provides warranty repair
services on certain devices it distributes for this supplier. The warranty period for these devices
ranges from 12 to 24months, and the Company is liable for providing warranty repair services
unless failure rates exceed a certain threshold. The Company records estimated expenses related to
future warranty repair at the time the devices are sold. Estimates for warranty costs are
calculated primarily based on managements assumptions related to cost of repairs and anticipated
failure rates. During 2006, this supplier re-branded its devices and provides aftermarket support
services including warranty repairs. The Company does not provide warranty repair services on the
re-branded devices on behalf of the supplier; however the Company does provide aftermarket support
services including warranty repairs for wireless devices sold by one of the Companys European
operations to one customer. Sales of 73 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements devices for which the Company provides warranty repair
services have decreased significantly since this supplier re-branded its devices. Warranty accruals
are adjusted from time to time when the Companys actual warranty claim experience differs from its
estimates and are recorded in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The change in
estimate for the year ended December31, 2007 was a result of higher failure rates and higher cost
of repairs than previously experienced. The obligation assumed through the acquisition of Dangaard
Telecom is related to a similar program. A summary of the changes in the product warranty accrual
is as follows in thousands

10. Shareholders Equity In May2006, the Board of Directors approved a 6 for 5 stock split paid in the form of a 20% stock
dividend. In 2005, the Board of Directors approved two 3 for 2 stock splits paid in the form of 50%
stock dividends. These stock splits were effected primarily to increase the liquidity of the stock,
increase the number of shares in the market and to improve the affordability of the stock for
investors. All references in the financial statements related to share amounts, per share amounts,
average shares outstanding and information concerning stock option plans have been adjusted
retroactively to reflect stock splits, including the Companys 6 for 5 stock split effected on May
31, 2006 and the 3 for 2 common stock splits effected on December30, 2005 and September15, 2005. The Company has authorized 10million shares of preferred stock, which remain unissued. The Board
of Directors has not yet determined the preferences, qualifications, relative voting or other
rights of the authorized shares of preferred stock. Treasury Stock As of December31, 2007, the Company has repurchased a total of 6,929,716 shares of its own common
stock at a weighted average price of $847 totaling $587million. Preferred Share Purchase Rights The Company has a Shareholders Rights Agreement, as amended, commonly known as a poison pill,
which provides that in the event an individual or entity becomes a beneficial holder of 15% or more
of the shares of the Companys capital stock an Acquiring Event, other shareholders of the
Company shall have the right to purchase shares of the Companys or in some cases, the acquirers
common stock at 50% of its then market value. Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, a dividend of
Preferred Share Purchase Rights was paid to holders of record of common stock on the record date as
of the close of business on February20, 1997. Each of these Rights entitles the registered holder
to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of the Companys SeriesA Junior Participating Preferred
Stock, par value $01 per share. Holders of the Companys common stock will, upon the occurrence of
an Acquiring Event, be entitled to purchase these Preferred Shares from the Company at a price of
$135 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent. Preferred Shares will not be
redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend
payment of $100 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the
dividend declared per share of common stock. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the
Preferred Shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share
but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of common
stock. Each Preferred Share will have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock. 11. Employee Benefit Plans The Company maintains an employee savings plan, which permits employees based in the United States
with at least thirty days of service to make contributions by salary reduction pursuant to section
401k of the Internal Revenue Code. After 90 74 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements days of service, the Company matches 50% of employee
contributions, up to 6% of each employees salary in cash. In connection with the required match,
the Companys contributions to the Plan were approximately $07million, $04million and $03
million in 2007, 2006 and 2005. During 2005, the Company entered into Supplemental Retirement Benefit Agreements Retirement
Agreements with certain executive officers. Under the Retirement Agreements, the Company will
implement a supplemental retirement benefit providing these executives with a 10-year annuity. The
Company has accounted for these Retirement Agreements as a pension plan the Plan in accordance
with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions as amended by SFAS 158. The Plan is
noncontributory and unfunded, and the Company does not expect to make any contributions to the Plan
in 2008. The amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements are as follows in

disputes German value-added tax authorities
There are two disputes pending with Finanzamt Flensburg, the German value-added tax, or VAT,
authorities the Finanzamt   
1.
Dangaard Telecoms subsidiary, Dangaard Telecom Denmark A/S, received an assessment
from the Finanzamt claiming that local German VAT should be applied on sales made by
Dangaard Telecom Denmark A/S to two specific German customers in 1997 and 1998. Finanzamt
claimed approximately $29million. The case is currently in abeyance waiting for a
principal decision or settlement involving similar cases pending in Germany. Dangaard
Telecom Denmark A/S continues to dispute this claim and intends to defend this matter
vigorously. The former shareholders of Dangaard Telecom agreed to indemnify Dangaard
Holding with respect to this dispute when Dangaard Holding acquired Dangaard Telecom, and
Dangaard Holding has agreed in the purchase agreement to transfer and assign these
indemnification rights to us or enforce them on our behalf if such transfer or assignment
is not permitted.   
2.
Dangaard Telecoms subsidiary, Dangaard Telecom Denmark A/S, received a notice from the
Finanzamt claiming that local German VAT should be applied on all sales made by Dangaard
Telecom Denmark A/S to German customers during the years 1999 to 2004. Finanzamt claimed
approximately $81million. The case is currently in abeyance waiting for a principal
decision or settlement involving similar cases pending in Germany. Dangaard Telecom Denmark
A/S continues to dispute this claim and intends to defend this matter vigorously. The
former shareholders of Dangaard Telecom agreed to indemnify Dangaard Holding with respect
to 80% of this claim when Dangaard Holding acquired Dangaard Telecom, and Dangaard Holding
has agreed in the purchase agreement to transfer and assign these indemnification rights to
us or enforce them on our behalf if such transfer or assignment is not permitted. Fleggaard group of companies The former headquarters of Dangaard Telecom was in premises rented from a member of the Fleggaard
group of companies, which was a former shareholder of Dangaard Telecom. A fire in March2006 caused
by another tenant in the building destroyed the headquarters and Dangaard Telecom had to leave the
building while awaiting renovation of its space. Because of Fleggards failure to renovate the
space, Dangaard Telecom terminated the lease. Fleggaard has disputed the lease termination and has
claimed $14million in damages. Dangaard Telecom continues to dispute this claim and intends to
defend this matter vigorously. Norwegian tax authorities Dangaard Telecoms subsidiary, Dangaard Telecom Norway AS Group, received notice from the Norwegian
tax authorities regarding tax claims in connection with certain capital gains. The Norwegian tax
authorities have claimed $27million. 75 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Dangaard Telecom Norway AS Group continues to dispute this claim and intends to defend this matter
vigorously. The former shareholders of Dangaard Telecom agreed to indemnify Dangaard Holding with
respect to 80% of this claim when Dangaard Holding acquired Dangaard Telecom, and Dangaard Holding
agreed in the purchase agreement with the Company Brightpoint to transfer and assign these
indemnification rights to the Company or enforce them on our behalf if such transfer or assignment
is not permitted. German tax authorities Dangaard Telecoms subsidiary, Dangaard Telecom Germany Holding GmbH, received notice from the
German tax authorities regarding tax claims in connection with the deductibility of certain stock
adjustments and various fees during the period 1998 to 2002. Dangaard Telecom Germany Holding GmbH
agreed to pay part of the claim, and the current amount in dispute is $18million. Dangaard
Telecom Germany Holding GmbH continues to dispute this claim and intends to defend this matter
vigorously. The former shareholders of Dangaard Telecom are obliged to indemnify Dangaard Holding
with respect to any such tax claims. Due to the claims limited size, however, it will be below an
agreed upon threshold, therefore the indemnification would not be activated by this claim if no
other claims for indemnification have been or are asserted. 13. Quarterly Results of Operations Unaudited

Note: Information in any one quarterly period should not be considered indicative of annual results
due to the effects of seasonality on the Companys business in certain markets. The information
presented above reflects   
the effects of the 6 for 5 common stock split effected on May31, 2006   
the effects of acquisitions as more fully described in Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements   
the effects of a $141million benefit related to the reversal of valuation
allowances on certain foreign tax credit carryforwards in the second quarter of
2007   
the effects of a $21million benefit resulting from a reduction in the statutory

and the effects of an $85million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of
2007. 76 Table of Contents Brightpoint, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14. Accounts Receivable Factoring Through the Spain and Germany operations acquired in the purchase of Dangaard Telecom, the Company
has agreements with unrelated third-parties for the factoring of specific accounts receivable of
these subsidiaries in order to reduce the amount of working capital required to fund such
receivables. The factoring of accounts receivable under these agreements are accounted for as sales
in accordance with SFAS 140, Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities, and accordingly, are accounted for as off-balance sheet arrangements. Proceeds on the
transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount. The discount is recorded as a
charge in Interest, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period of the sale. Net funds received reduced accounts receivable outstanding while increasing cash. The Company is
the collection agent on behalf of the third parties for these arrangements and has no significant
retained interests or servicing liabilities related to the accounts receivable that it has sold. At December31, 2007, the Company had sold $730million of accounts receivable pursuant to these
agreements, which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date. Fees
paid pursuant to these agreements were $09million for the year ended December31, 2007. 15. Restructuring Prior to the completion of the acquisition of Dangaard Telecom, Company management began
formulating a plan to exit certain activities of the combined company. Components of this
preliminary plan included terminating Dangaard Telecoms implementation of SAP and related software
and consolidating certain facilities. As part of that decision, the Company determined that costs
capitalized related to the implementation of SAP in the period after the acquisition of Dangaard
Telecom were impaired under SFAS 144. Accordingly, an impairment charge of $71million was
recorded in the Companys Europe division. In addition, the Company recorded $16million in
severance and other costs to consolidate the Brightpoint and Dangaard Telecom operations in
Germany. The Company anticipates taking an additional restructuring charge during the first half of
2008 of approximately $32million to $38million associated with the final exit of our redundant
warehouse and office facility in Germany. As Company management finalizes the plan, additional liabilities may result primarily related to
involuntary employee termination costs and costs to exit certain facilities in our Europe
operations. These additional liabilities will be recognized as liabilities assumed in the business
combination and included in the allocation of the acquisition costs in accordance with EITF 95-3,
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchased Business Combination. A plan is expected
to be completed by the first quarter of 2008. Adjustments to the purchase price allocation under
the preliminary plan resulted in reductions of assets acquired of $167million and additional
liabilities assumed of $27million. Reserve activity for the restructuring as of December31, 2007 is as follows in thousands

78 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Brightpoint, Inc. We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Brightpoint, Inc. as of December
31, 2007 and 2006, and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders Equity and
Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. Our audits also
include the financial statement schedule listed in a 2. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Brightpoint, Inc. as of December31, 2007 and 2006
and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the financial information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R Share Based Payments on January1, 2006. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, Brightpoint, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February

/s/ Ernst Young LLP Indianapolis, Indiana
February22, 2008 79 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
Brightpoint, Inc. We have audited Brightpoint, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Brightpoint,
Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material misstatement exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. As indicated in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,
managements assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting did not include the internal controls of Dangaard Telecom A/S and subsidiaries and
certain assets and liabilities of CellStar Latin America, which are included in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of Brightpoint, Inc. and constituted 63% and 84% of total and net assets,
respectively as of December31, 2007 and 25% and 14% of revenues and net income respectively for
the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Brightpoint, Inc.
also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Dangaard
Telecom A/S and subsidiaries and certain assets and liabilities of CellStar Latin America. In our opinion, Brightpoint, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Brightpoint, Inc. as of December31, 2007
and 2006 and the related Consolidated Statements of Operations, Shareholders Equity, and Cash
Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and the financial statement
schedule listed in a2 of Brightpoint, Inc. and our report dated February22, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 80 Table of Contents

Item5. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its
Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of its
disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on that
evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer also conducted an evaluation of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f
Internal Control to determine whether any changes in Internal Control occurred during the
quarter ended December31, 2007 that have materially affected or which are reasonably likely to
materially affect Internal Control. Based on that evaluation, there has been no change in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal
control over financial reporting, except that we are still in the process of integrating the
CellStar and Dangaard operations and will be incorporating these operations as part of our internal
controls. For purposes of this evaluation, the impact of the acquisition of certain assets and
assumption of certain liabilities from CellStar, which closed on the last day of the fiscal quarter
ended March31, 2007, and the impact of the acquisition of Dangaard Telecom A/S, which closed on
July31, 2007, on our internal controls over financial reporting has been excluded. See Note 3 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item8 for a discussion of the above
acquisitions. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2007 using the criteria set forth in Internal Control Integrated Framework
founded by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Managements
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did
not include the internal controls of Dangaard Telecom A/S and subsidiaries and certain assets and
liabilities of CellStar Latin America, which were acquired by the Company in July2007 and March
2007, respectively, which are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brightpoint,
Inc. and constituted 63% of total assets as of December31, 2007 and 25% of revenues for the year
then ended. Companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control
over financial reporting during the first year of the acquisition under guidelines established by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on this evaluation, management of Brightpoint, Inc.
has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2007. The management of Brightpoint, Inc. is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the
Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting for the Company and all related information appearing in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems which are
intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized
use or disposition, transactions are executed in accordance with managements authorization and
accounting records are reliable for preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. A staff of internal auditors regularly monitors, on a
worldwide basis, the adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls. The Vice-President
of Internal Audit reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors. 82 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over
financial reporting in future periods is subject to risk that
those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The financial statements for each of the years covered in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been
audited by independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst Young LLP. Additionally, Ernst 
Young LLP has provided an independent assessment as to the fairness of the financial statements and
