December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders
GSE Systems, Inc. We have audited GSE Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Item 9Ab. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. F-1 In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensiveloss, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated March 14, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Baltimore, Maryland

F-8  1.Business and basis of presentation GSE Systems, Inc. GSE Systems, GSE or the Company provides training simulators and educational solutions to the energy, process, manufacturing and government sectors. The Companys operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, rapid technological changes, success of the Companys product development, marketing and distribution strategies, the need to manage growth, the need to retain key personnel and protect intellectual property, and the availability of additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company. At December 31, 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $266 million.Although the Company was in default on two of its financial covenants under its line of credit agreement, the Company has received a written waiver from its bank.At December 31, 2010, the Company had two separate revolving credit agreements for revolving lines of credit with BOA which were to expire on May 31, 2012.The credit facilities enabled the Company to borrow funds to support working capital needs and standby letters of credit.The first line of credit which was in the principal amount of up to $50 million. This line of credit was 90% guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.The second line of credit was in the principal amount of up to $25 million.Both credit agreements contained financial covenants with respect to the Companys minimum tangible net worth, debt service coverage ratio, and funded debt to EBITDA ratio. The Company was in default on its the funded debt to EBITDA ratio as of December 31, 2010.Due to the Companys financial covenant default, Bank of America BOA has made the following amendments to the Companys revolving credit agreements effective March 14, 2011 A written waiver has been granted for the funded debt to EBITDA ratio default. The $50 million principal line of credit has been terminated. The financial covenants for the $25 million principal line of credit have been deleted. The Company is required to cash collateralize all outstanding standby letters of credit, which totals $34 million. All future letters of credit issued by BOA must be cash collateralized.  Borrowings under the line of credit must be cash collateralized.Currently the Company has in place a $600,000 certificate of deposit as collateral for the line of credit. Despite these changes to its lines of credit, the Company anticipates that its cash on hand and its normal operations will provide all of the funds necessary to fund its consolidated operations during the next twelve months.The Company believes that it will have sufficient liquidity and working capital without additional financing. 2.Summary of significant accounting policies Principles of consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. F-9 Accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets, valuation of intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration issued in business acquisitions, and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Revenue recognition The majority of the Companys revenue is derived through the sale of uniquely designed systems containing hardware, software and other materials under fixed-price contracts.In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the revenue under these fixed-price contracts is accounted for on the percentage-of-completion method. This methodology recognizes revenue and earnings as work progresses on the contract and is based on an estimate of the revenue and earnings earned to date, less amounts recognized in prior periods.The Company bases its estimate of the degree of completion of the contract by reviewing the relationship of costs incurred to date to the expected total costs that will be incurred on the project. Estimated contract earnings are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses, and the cumulative effect of any change in estimate is recognized in the period in which the change is identified. Estimated losses are charged against earnings in the period such losses are identified.The Company recognizes revenue arising from contract claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and realization is probable and there is a legal basis of the claim. As the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion method, it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical and projected claims experience.The Companys long-term contracts generally provide for a one-year warranty on parts, labor and any bug fixes as it relates to software embedded in the systems. The Companys system design contracts do not normally provide for post customer support service PCS in terms of software upgrades, software enhancements or telephone support.In order to obtain PCS, the customers must normally purchase a separate contract.Such PCS arrangements are generally for a one-year period renewable annually and include customer support, unspecified software upgrades, and maintenance releases.The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts ratably over the life of the agreements. Revenue from the sale of software licenses which do not require significant modifications or customization for the Companys modeling tools are recognized when the license agreement is signed, the license fee is fixed and determinable, delivery has occurred, and collection is considered probable. F-10 Revenue for contracts with multiple elements is recognized in accordance with ASC 605-25 Revenue Recognition- Multiple Element Arrangements. Revenues from certain consulting or training contracts are recognized on a time-and-material basis.For time-and-material type contracts, revenue is recognized based on hours incurred at a contracted labor rate plus expenses. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. The Company had $170 million and $150,000 deposited in a money market account with BOA on December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.There were no other cash equivalents. Contract receivables Contract receivables include recoverable costs and accrued profit not billed which represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed.The liability Billings in excess of revenue earned represents billings in excess of revenue recognized. Billed receivables are recorded at invoiced amounts.The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical trends of past due accounts, write-offs, and specific identification and review of past due accounts.The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows in thousands As of and for the  Years ended December 31  2010 2009 2008  Beginning balance 1,746 2 2  Current year provision 294 1,744  Current year write-offs  Ending balance 2,040 1,746 2  At a meeting of ESAs three shareholders held at ESA on February 17, 2010, in response to ESA deteriorating financial condition,the shareholders reached agreement to significantly reduce costs and begin to explore options up to and including the selling of ESA.Accordingly, the Company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by $16 million for the outstanding trade receivable from ESA as of December 31, 2009. Equipment and leasehold improvements, net Equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method with estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years.Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method.Upon sale or retirement, the cost and related amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. F-11 Software development costs Certain computer software development costs are capitalized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.Capitalization of computer software development costs begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility. Capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is commercially available for general release to customers.Amortization of capitalized computer software development costs is included in cost of revenue and is determined using the straight-line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, not to exceed three years. Development expenditures Development expenditures incurred to meet customer specifications under contracts are charged to contract costs.Company sponsored development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The amounts incurred for Company sponsored development activities relating to the development of new products and services or the improvement of existing products and services, were approximately $16 million, $13 million, and $907,000, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.Certain of these expenditures were capitalized as software development costs.See Note 7, Software development costs. Impairment of long-lived assets Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment, capitalized computer software costs subject to amortization, and intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Companys intangible assets include amounts recognized in connection with acquisitions, including customer relationships, contract backlog and software. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the intangible assets, except for contract backlog which is recognized in proportion to the projected revenue streams of the related backlog. Intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Except for goodwill, the Company does not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. F-12 Goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired.The Company reviews its goodwill annually, on November 30, for impairment, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value.For goodwill, the impairment determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps.First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount.Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.No impairment losses were recognized in 2010, 2009 or 2008. Foreign currency translation Balance sheet accounts for foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, and income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensiveloss.Transaction gains and losses, resulting from changes in exchange rates, are recorded in operating income in the period in which they occur.For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, foreign currency transaction gains/losses were approximately $297,000, $130,000, and $41,000, respectively. Warranty As the Company recognizes revenue under the percentage-of-completion method, it provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience and projected claims.The activity in the warranty accounts is as follows in thousands As of and for the

Income taxes Income taxes are provided under the asset and liability method.Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Provision is made for the Company current liability for federal, state and foreign income taxes and the change in the Company deferred income tax assets and liabilities. F-13 Stock-based compensation Compensation expense related to share based awards is recognized on a pro rata straight-line basis based on the value of share awards that are scheduled to vest during the requisite service period.During the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, 2009and 2008, the Company recognized $807,000,$906,000 and $650,000, respectively, of pre-tax stock-based compensation expense under the fair value method.As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $26 million of unrecognized compensation related to the unvested portion of outstanding stock option awards expected to be recognized through April 2016. Loss per share Basic loss per share is based on the weighted average number of outstanding common shares for the period.Diluted loss per share adjusts the weighted average shares outstanding for the potential dilution that could occur if stock options, warrants or convertible preferred stock were exercised or converted into common stock.The number of common shares and common share equivalents used in the determination of basic and diluted loss per share was as follows F-14  in thousands, except for share and per share amounts  Years ended December 31  2010 2009 2008 Numerator Net loss attributed to common stockholders 2,249 797 690   Denominator Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share 18,975,007 16,938,392 15,746,616  Effect of dilutive securities Employee stock options, warrants and convertible preferred stock  Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per share 18,975,007 16,938,392 15,746,616  Shares related to dilutive securities excluded because inclusion would be anti-dilutive 1,679,907 1,791,757 1,196,746 Conversion of outstanding stock options and warrants was not assumed for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 because the impact was anti-dilutive. Included in theshares related to dilutive securities excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were in the money options and warrants totaling 518,546 shares, 641,631 shares and 910,480 shares, respectively. Concentration of credit risk The Company is subject to concentration of credit risk with respect to contract receivables. Credit risk on contract receivables is mitigated by the nature of the Company worldwide customer base and its credit policies.The Company customers are not concentrated in any specific geographic region, but are concentrated in the energy industry. The following customers have provided more than 10% of the Companys revenue for the indicated period

105 F-15 Fair values of financial instruments The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value due to their short term duration. Deferred financing fees The Company amortizes the cost incurred to obtain debt financing using the straight-line method over the term of the underlying obligations.The amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense. Deferred financing costs are classified within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments The Company adopted ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, on January 1, 2009.ASC 815 enhances the disclosure requirements about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company utilizes forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage market risks associated with the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. It is the Company policy to use such derivative financial instruments to protect against market risk arising in the normal course of business in order to reduce the impact of these exposures. The Company minimizes credit exposure by limiting counterparties to nationally recognized financial institutions. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding of approximately 16 million Pounds Sterling, 106 million Euro, and 8652 million Japanese Yen at fixed rates.At December 31, 2009, the Company had foreign exchange contracts outstanding of approximately 2 million Pounds Sterling, 3 million Euro, and 759 million Japanese Yen at fixed rates. The contracts expire on various dates through February 2014.The Company had not designated the foreign exchange contracts as hedges and had recorded the estimated fair value of the contracts in the consolidated balance sheet as follows  December 31 in thousands 2010 2009  Asset derivatives Prepaid expenses and other current assets 208 515 Other assets 117 396  325 911  Liability derivatives Other current liabilities 204 34 Other liabilities 40 65  244 99  Net fair value 81 812 The changes in the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts are included in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations.

Of the $23 million gross purchase price, the Company accrued $740,000 of contingent consideration based on its estimate of the fair value of the potential contingent consideration payable to the TAS Shareholders on the first and second anniversaries of the closing date. The Company will estimate the fair value of the recorded amount of contingent consideration on a quarterly basis and any subsequent adjustments based on actual payments or revised estimates will be recognized in the selling, general, and administrative expenses of the consolidated statement of operations during the period of adjustment.

F-21 In January 2006, GSE received a $151 million contract from ESA the ESA Contract to supply five simulators and an integrated training program. The Company received change orders totaling $18 million from ESA which increased the total order value to $169 million. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recognized $12 million, of contract revenue on this project using the percentage-of-completion method, which accounted for 42% of the Companys consolidated revenue.In accordance with the equity method of accounting, the Company eliminated 10% of the profit from the ESA Contract as the training simulators were assets that had been recorded on the books of ESA, and the Company was thus required to eliminate its proportionate share of the profit included in the asset value.The profit elimination totaled $28,000 for the year ended December 31, 2008, and was recorded as another liability on the balance sheet.ESA assigned a four year life to the simulators and began to amortize the training simulators on their books effective January 1, 2009.Accordingly, on January 1, 2009, GSE began to amortize the deferred profit to other income over a four year period, recognizing income of $181,000 in the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company has provided a partial guarantee of 10% of ESAs credit facility with Union National Bank UNB; $12 million was deposited into a restricted interest-bearing account with UNB in 2006.The interest earned on the restricted cash is part of the pledged deposit. At December 31, 2009, ESA had borrowed a total of AED 364 million $99 million from its credit facility with UNB, including accrued interest payable.ESA was delinquent in paying both principal and interest a total of AED 53 million or $15 million and in January 2010, UNB drew upon the guarantees of the three partners to pay off the delinquency, withdrawing $145,000 from GSEs restricted cash account.In February 2010, GSE was notified that ESA had missed another loan payment and that 10% of the amount due $24,000 would be withdrawn from the Companys restricted cash account. At a meeting of ESAs three shareholders held at ESA on February 17, 2010, the shareholders reached agreement to significantly reduce costs and begin to explore options up to and including the selling of ESA. Accordingly, based upon these events, the Company determined that its remaining investment in ESA at December 31, 2009 was impaired and established reserves for the $16 million trade receivable due from ESA at December 31, 2009 and for the cash that GSE has on deposit with UNB as a partial guarantee for ESAs credit facility.Partially offsetting these charges was the reversal of the remaining deferred profit related to the Companys sale of five simulators to ESA in prior years and the remaining agent fee that was due upon payment of the final outstanding receivable.The charges recorded and the presentation in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 are as follows F-22  Year ended in thousands December 31, 2009  Trade receivable 1,604 Accrued agent fee 96 Operating expense 1,508  Restricted cash- bank guarantee and accrued interest income 1,291 Investment in ESA 117 Deferred profit 543 Other expense, net 865  Total 2,373 In 2010, Union National Bank withdrew a total of $294,000 from the cash GSE had on deposit with them as a partial guarantee against ESAs line of credit.Any interest income earned from this account in 2010 was not recorded in interest income but was credited to thereserve balance.At December 31, 2010 the Company had $10 million remaining in the UNB account which was fully reserved. 9.Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, and such adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statement disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principle or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820 are Level 1:inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2:inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3:inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. F-23 The Company considers the recorded value of certain of its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 based upon the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The Company had $170 million and $150,000 deposited in a money market account with BOA on December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, the Company was contingently liable for five standby letters of credit and three surety bonds totaling $47 million which represent performance bonds on eight contracts.The Company has deposited the full value of one standby letters of credit in certificates of deposit $179,000 which have been restricted in that the Company does not have access to these funds until the related letters of credit have expired.The cash has been recorded on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2010 as restricted cash and long-term restricted cash depending on the expiration date of the certificate of deposit. On May 5, 2009, one of the Companys two credit agreements with Bank of America was amended to include a $600,000 certificate of deposit issued by Bank of America in the borrowing base calculation to determine the maximum amount of available funds that the Company could borrow from the line.The cash deposited in this certificate of deposit has been recorded on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2010 and 2009 as restricted cash. The following table presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2010  Quoted Prices Significant  in Active Other Significant  Markets for Observable Unobservable  Identical Assets Inputs Inputs in thousands Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total   Money market fund 17,017 17,017 Certificates of deposit 779 779 Foreign exchange contracts 325 325  Total assets 17,796 325 18,121  Foreign exchange contracts 244 244  Total liabilities 244 244 F-24 10.Long-term debt At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no long-term debt. Line of Credit At December 31, 2010, the Company had two separate revolving credit agreements for revolving lines of credit with BOA which were to expire on May 31, 2012.The Company and its subsidiary, GSE Power Systems, Inc., were jointly and severally liable as co-borrowers.The credit facilities enabled the Company to borrow funds to support working capital needs and standby letters of credit.The first line of credit which was in the principal amount of up to $35 million was amended on March 29, 2010 to increase the principal amount to $50 million.This revolving line of credit enabled the Company to borrow funds up to 90% of eligible foreign accounts receivable, plus 75% of eligible unbilled foreign receivables and 100% of cash collateral pledged to BOA on outstanding warranty standby letters of credit. This line of credit was 90% guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States.The interest rate on this line of credit is based on the daily LIBOR rate plus 150 basis points, with interest only payments due monthly.The second line of credit was in the principal amount of up to $25 million. This line of credit enabled the Company to borrow funds up to 80% of domestic accounts receivable, 30% of domestic unbilled receivables and 100% of the principal balance of a $600,000 certificate of deposit issued by BOA.The interest rate on this line of credit was based on the daily LIBOR rate plus 225 basis points, with interest only payments due monthly. The credit agreements contained certain restrictive covenants regarding future acquisitions, incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends.In addition, both credit agreements contained financial covenants with respect to the Companys minimum tangible net worth, debt service coverage ratio, and funded debt to EBITDA ratio.At December 31, 2010 and throughout all of 2010, the Company had not paid any interest or principal payments related to any borrowings for over one year.As such the debt service coverage ratio is not applicable at December 31, 2010.The financial covenant calculations at December 31, 2010 are shown below 
As of

Not to Exceed 250 : 100
3090 : 100 For the funded debt to EBITDA ratio calculation, the amount of outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds that are not cash collateralized are included as funded debt.At December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds that were not cash collateralized of $44 million.Due to the Companys net loss of $22 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company was in default on its funded debt to EBITDA ratio at December 31, 2010. Due to the Companys financial covenant default, BOA has made the following amendments to the Companys revolving credit agreements effective March 14, 2011 A written waiver has been granted for the funded debt to EBITDA ratio default. The $50 million principal line of credit has been terminated. The financial covenants for the $25 million principal line of credit have been deleted. The Company is required to cash collateralize all outstanding standby letters of credit, which totals $34 million. All future letters of credit issued by BOA must be cash collateralized. 
Borrowings under the line of credit must be cash collateralized.Currently the Company has in place a $600,000 certificate of deposit as collateral for the line of credit.

F-26 The effective income tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate due to the following  Effective Tax Rate Percentage  Years ended December 31  2010 2009 2008 Statutory federal income tax rate 340 340 340

7642 230  Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements.A summary of the tax effect of the significant components of the deferred income tax assets liabilities is as follows in thousands December 31  2010 2009 2008 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 5,893 5,650 6,691 Capital loss carryforwards 2,472 2,443 1,675 Accruals and reserves 126 251 61 Expenses not currently deductible for tax purposes 1,358 1,153 412 Alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 166 166 162 Other 1,163 660 654 Total deferred tax asset 11,178 10,323 9,655 Valuation allowance 8,662 8,375 8,259 Total deferred tax asset less valuation allowance 2,516 1,948 1,396  Deferred tax liabilities Tax in excess of book depreciation 8 Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiary 1,790 1,313 683 Software development costs 677 724 579 Other 421 87 Total deferred tax liability 2,888 2,124 1,270  Net deferred tax asset liability 372 176 126 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future income in making this assessment. Management believes that the Company will achieve profitable operations in future years that will enable the Company to recover the benefit of its deferred tax assets. However, other than for a portion of the deferred tax assets that are related to the Companys Swedish and English subsidiaries, the Company presently does not have sufficient objective evidence to substantiate the recovery of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company has established a full $87 million valuation allowance on its U.S. and Scottish deferred tax assets at December 31, 2010.The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets increased by $287,000 in 2010, increased by $116,000 in 2009 and decreased by $609,000 in 2008. F-27 At December 31, 2010, the Companys largest deferred tax asset related to a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of $56 million which expires in various amounts between 2017 and 2030.The amount of U.S. loss carryforward which can be used by the Company each year is limited due to changes in the Companys ownership which occurred in 2003.Thus, a portion of the Companys loss carryforward may expire unutilized. The Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits would significantly decrease or increase within the next twelve months. The Companys policy for recording interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions is to record such items as a component of income tax expense.As of December 31, 2010, the Company has no accrued interest or penalties. 12.Capital stock The Companys Board of Directors has authorized 32,000,000 total shares of capital stock, of which 30,000,000 are designated as common stock and 2,000,000 are designated as preferred stock. The Board of Directors has the authority to establish one or more classes of preferred stock and to determine, within any class of preferred stock, the preferences, rights and other terms of such class.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.Based upon our evaluation, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, whose report appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  55  cChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company has made no changes in its internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. dLimitation of Effectiveness of Controls Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations.Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate this risk. Item 1. Business 4 Item 1A. Risk Factors 21 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments 26 Item 2.
