Item 5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act
as of December 31, 2005. Based on that evaluation, its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2005, in that the Company did
not issue current reports on Form 8-K in connection with two press releases
which announced quarterly revenues and income. The Company has taken steps to
correct this from happening in the future.
Except as noted, there has been no change in the Company internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act during the Company fourth fiscal quarter ended December 31,
2005, that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect
the Company internal control over financial reporting.                    25
