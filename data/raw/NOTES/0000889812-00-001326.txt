Henry Schein, Inc.
Melville, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Henry
Schein, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998, and
the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 25, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Henry
Schein, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998, and
the results of their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 25, 1999 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In thousands, except share data Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Henry
Schein, Inc. and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries the
Company. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which are greater than 20%
and less than or equal to 50% owned, are accounted for under the equity method.
All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in
consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fiscal Year
The Company reports its operations on a 52-53 week basis ending on the
last Saturday of December. Fiscal years ended December 25, 1999, December 26,
1998 and December 27, 1997 all consisted of 52 weeks.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered
except for revenues derived from post contract customer support for practice
management software which is deferred and recognized ratably over the period in
which the support is to be provided.
Inventories
Inventories consist substantially of finished goods and are valued at the
lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO
method.
Property and Equipment and Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed
primarily under the straight-line method over the following estimated useful
lives                               Years
Buildings and improvements..      40
Machinery and warehouse equipment..     5-10

Taxes on Income
The Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in
the Company financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax
consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other
than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates will be recognized as income or
expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company files a
consolidated Federal income tax return with its 80% or greater owned
subsidiaries.
Statement of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has
determined that the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows were
not material for the years ended December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the accumulated comprehensive loss account in stockholders' equity.
Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in
earnings, except for certain hedging transactions see below.
Financial Instruments
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm
commitments denominated in foreign currencies. Gains and losses on these
positions are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction when it is
completed.
In order to manage interest rate exposure, the Company has entered into
interest rate swap agreements to exchange variable rate debt into fixed rate
debt without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Net payments or
receipts under the agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense.
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amount reported for
long-term debt approximates fair value because certain of the underlying
instruments are at variable rates, which are repriced frequently. The remaining
portion of long-term debt approximates fair value because the interest
approximates current market rates for financial instruments with similar
maturities and terms.                    35            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
In thousands, except share data Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies--Continued Acquisitions
The net assets of businesses purchased are recorded at their fair value at
the acquisition date and the consolidated financial statements include their
operations from that date. Any excess of acquisition costs over the fair value
of identifiable net assets acquired is included in goodwill and is amortized on
a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 30 years. Certain acquisitions
provide for contingent consideration, primarily cash, to be paid in the event
certain financial performance targets are satisfied over periods typically not
exceeding three years from the date of acquisition. The Company policy is to
record a liability for such amounts when it becomes probable that targets will
be met.
Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as goodwill and property and equipment, are
evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets. When any such
impairment exists, the related assets will be written down to fair value. In
connection with certain acquisitions, the Company has determined that certain
long-lived assets have been impaired see Note 6.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Under the intrinsic value based
method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of
the stock at grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro forma disclosures of net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value based method of accounting
had been applied as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in periods in which they have a
dilutive effect, the effect of common shares issuable upon exercise of stock
options.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that
under generally accepted accounting principles are excluded from net income as
these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to stockholders' equity.
The Company comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation
adjustments.                    36            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. In May 1999, the FASB voted to
delay the effective date of FAS 133 by one year. The Company will be required to
adopt FAS 133 for transactions entered into for quarters in the fiscal year
beginning after December 30, 2000. FAS 133 requires that all derivative
instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of
the hedge transaction and the type of hedge transaction. The ineffective portion
of all hedges will be recognized in earnings. The Company is in the process of
determining the impact that the adoption of FAS 133 will have on its results of
operations and financial position.

goodwill was primarily due to eight acquisitions, including the purchase of six
companies which totaled approximately $149,166 which included $38,972 of
acquired goodwill, the minority interests of two subsidiaries, which totaled
approximately $1,272 and additional purchase price consideration of
approximately $7,939 for one current year and five prior year acquisitions.
Other intangibles include covenants not to compete, computer programming costs,

The Company has completed the acquisition of 38 healthcare distribution
and technology businesses between 1997 and 1999, the most significant of which
were; i in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
during 1999; General Injectables and Vaccines, Inc. GIV through the purchase
of all of the outstanding common stock of Biological Popular Culture, Inc., a
leading independent direct marketer of vaccines and other injectables to office
based practitioners throughout the United States; and the Heiland Group GmbH
Heiland, the largest direct marketer of healthcare supplies to the medical,
dental, and veterinarian office-based practitioners, in Germany; and ii in
transactions accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting
during 1998 and 1997, respectively; the H. Meer Dental Supply Co., Inc, Meer
a distributor of consumable dental supplies and equipment with sales and service
centers located throughout the United States; Sullivan Dental Products, Inc.
Sullivan, distributor of consumable dental supplies and dental equipment
with 52 sales and service centers located throughout the United States; Micro
Bio-Medics, Inc. MBMI, a distributor of medical supplies to physicians and
hospitals as well as to other healthcare professionals nationwide; and Dentrix
Dental Systems, Inc. Dentrix, a leading provider of clinically-based dental
practice management systems.
GIV and Heiland had 1998 net sales of approximately $120,000 and $130,000,
respectively. The purchase price and resultant goodwill, which is being
amortized over 20 years, for these acquisitions was approximately $65,000 and
$47,400, and $60,400 and $55,800, respectively see Note 8a. The acquisition
agreements for GIV and Heiland provide for additional consideration of up to
$20,000 per year through 2004, not to exceed $75,000 in total, and $3,900 per
year through 2001, respectively, to be paid if certain sales and profitability
targets are met. The GIV acquisition agreement also provides for additional
consideration of $5,400 based upon sales of new products, as defined.
Pursuant to the respective merger agreements for Meer, Sullivan, MBM and
Dentrix, which were completed on August 14, 1998, November 12, 1997, August 1,
1997 and February 28, 1997, the Company issued approximately 2,974,000,
7,594,900, 3,231,400 and 1,070,000 shares of its Common Stock with aggregate
market values on their respective closing dates of approximately $132,700 266,800, $122,800 and $29,400, respectively, and assumed and exchanged all
options to purchase Sullivan and MBMI stock for options to purchase 1,192,000
and 1,117,000, respectively, of the Company Common Stock. Prior to its
acquisition by the Company, Meer elected to be taxed as an S Corporation under
the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the current taxable income or loss of
Meer was attributable to its shareholders. Since its acquisition, Meer has been
taxed as a regular corporation. For the years ended December 26, 1998 and
December 27, 1997, pro forma adjustments have been made to the restated
statements of operations to reflect the income tax provisions and recoveries
that would have been provided for had Meer been subject to income taxes in prior
years.                    40            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Additionally, during 1999, the Company acquired six other companies, which
had total sales in 1998 of approximately $74,000, that were accounted for under
the purchase method of accounting. The total purchase price of the six companies
acquired was approximately, $11,800 and the resulting goodwill of $8,266 is
being amortized over 30 years. The Company also acquired one company which is
being accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting which
was not material. In connection with this acquisition, the Company issued
189,833 shares of its Common Stock with an aggregate market value of $64
million.
During 1998, the Company acquired four other businesses, with aggregate
net sales for 1997 of approximately $85,000, three of which were accounted for
under the pooling of interests method of accounting, with the remaining
acquisition of a 501% ownership interest being accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. The total amount of cash paid for the purchased
businesses and the value of the Company Common Stock issued in connection
with three of these acquisitions was approximately $6,800 and approximately
$18,400, respectively. In connection with one of the acquisitions, the Company
issued shares of a subsidiary, with rights equivalent to those of the Company
Common Stock, which are exchangeable into 603,500 shares of the Company Common
Stock, at each shareholders' option, and had an aggregate value of approximately
$24,000.
During 1997, the Company acquired 21 other businesses, three of which were
accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting, with the
remainder being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 15 for
100% ownership interests and three for majority ownership interests. The total
amount of cash paid and promissory notes issued, and the value of the Company
Common Stock issued in connection with these acquisitions was $40,798 and
$34,000, respectively.
The financial statements have been restated to give retroactive effect to
the Meer, Sullivan, MBMI and Dentrix transactions only, as the remaining
pooling transactions were not material and have been included in the
consolidated financial statements from the beginning of the quarter in which the
acquisitions occurred. Results of operations of the business acquisitions
accounted for under the purchase method of accounting had been included in the
consolidated financial statements commencing with their respective acquisition
dates.
During 1997, pursuant to a shareholders' agreement, certain minority
shareholders of a subsidiary of the Company exercised their option to sell their
shares in the subsidiary to the Company. The value of the shares put to the
Company was approximately $11,800, of which approximately $3,200 was paid for in
cash, with the remainder payable over two years in equal annual installments.
The Company has incurred certain direct costs in connection with the
aforementioned acquisitions accounted for under the pooling of interests method
of accounting and the integration of these and certain other acquired businesses

b Revolving Credit Agreement
On August 15, 1997, the Company entered into an amended revolving credit
agreement which, among other things, increased the maximum available borrowings
to $150,000 from $100,000 and extended the term of the agreement to August 15,
2002. The interest rate on any borrowings under the agreement is based on prime
or LIBOR as defined in the agreement, which were 850%, and 619%, respectively,
at December 25, 1999. The borrowings outstanding at December 25, 1999 were at
interest rates ranging from 425% to 694%. The agreement provides for a sliding
scale fee ranging from 01% to 03%, based upon certain financial ratios, on any
unused portion of the commitment. The agreement also provides, among other
things, that the Company will maintain, on a consolidated basis, as defined, a
minimum tangible net worth; current, cash flow, and interest coverage ratios; a
maximum leverage ratio; and contains restrictions relating to annual dividends
in excess of $500, guarantees of subsidiary debt, investments in subsidiaries,
mergers and acquisitions, liens, capital expenditures, certain changes in
ownership and employee and shareholder loans.
c Notes Payable for Business Acquisitions
In May 1997, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a term loan for
$8,299 to acquire the remaining minority interests of a foreign subsidiary. The
loan is denominated in British Pounds, and interest is payable quarterly at
55%. In 1998 the Company paid $4,478 and the remaining amount due was paid
during 1999.
In October 1997, the Company entered into a Netherlands Guilder NLG loan
in the amount of 65 million NLG. The loan serves to hedge the repayment of an
intercompany loan in the same amount, denominated in NLG, due from a Dutch
subsidiary. The NLG loan calls for periodic payments and a balloon payment of
41 million NLG in January 2002. Interest is payable quarterly at a rate of
528% per annum, plus a margin. The agreement also provides for the same
financial covenants and restrictions as the revolving credit agreement.
As of December 25, 1999, the aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturing
in each of the next five years are as follows: 2000 - $3,879; 2001 - $5,648;
2002 - $65,923; 2003 - $2,524; 2004 - $2,020.

At December 25, 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal income tax purposes of $718, which are available to offset future
Federal taxable income through 2010. Foreign net operating losses totaled

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on

will continue to be reinvested. These earnings could become subject to
additional tax if they were remitted as dividends, if foreign earnings were
loaned to the Company or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Company should sell its
stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount
of additional tax, if any, that might be payable on the foreign earnings;
however, the Company believes that foreign tax credits would substantially
offset any U.S. tax. At December 25, 1999, the cumulative amount of reinvested
earnings was approximately $9,790.
Note 10--Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations
a Financial Instruments
To reduce its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest
rates, the Company is party to foreign currency forward contracts and interest
rate swaps with major financial institutions.
While the Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the counter parties of these contracts, the Company does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counter parties. The Company does not require collateral
or other security to support these financial instruments.                    47            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued
In thousands, except share data Note 10-Financial Instruments and Credit Risk Concentrations--Continued
As of December 25, 1999, the Company had outstanding foreign currency
forward contracts aggregating $10,800 related to debt and the purchase and sale
of merchandise. The contracts hedge against currency fluctuations of Deutsche
Mark $800, British Pounds $8,200, Swiss Francs $500 and Australian dollars
$1,300. At December 25, 1999, the Company had net deferred losses from foreign
currency forward contracts of $322. The contracts expire at various dates
through February 2001.
As of December 25, 1999, the Company had $13,000 outstanding in interest
rate swaps. These swaps are used to convert floating rate debt relating to the
Company revolving credit agreement, to fixed rate debt to reduce the Company
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The net result was to substitute a
weighted average fixed interest rate of 72% for the variable LIBOR rate on
$13,000 of the Company debt. The swaps expire in December 2003 and December
2004. Under the interest rate environment during the year ended December 25,
1999, the net fair value of the Company interest rate swap agreements resulted
in a recognized loss of $263.
b Concentrations of Credit Risk
Certain financial instruments potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk. These financial instruments consist primarily of
trade receivables and short-term cash investments. The Company places its
short-term cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions and,
by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
limited due to a large customer base and its dispersion across different types
of healthcare professionals and geographic areas. The Company maintains an
allowance for losses based on the expected collectability of all receivables.
Included in Accounts receivable at December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998 is
$3,998 and $10,791, respectively, related to Easy DentalR Plus software sales
with non-interest bearing extended payment terms. Total unamortized discounts at
December 25, 1999 and December 26, 1998 amounted to $348 and $293 based on an
imputed interest rate of 850% and 775%, respectively. Included in interest
income for the years ended December 25, 1999, December 26, 1998 and December 27,
1997 was approximately $45, $737 and $1,216, respectively, of imputed interest
relating to these non-interest bearing extended payment term receivables.
Note 11-Segment and Geographic Data
The Company has two reportable segments: healthcare distribution and
technology. The healthcare distribution segment which is comprised of the
Company dental, medical, veterinary and international business groups,
distributes healthcare products primarily consumable and services to office
based healthcare practitioners and professionals in the combined North American,
European and the Pacific Rim markets. The technology segment consists primarily
of the Company practice management software business and certain other
value-added products and services which are distributed primarily to healthcare
professionals in the North American market.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates segment
performance based on operating income.
The Company reportable segments are strategic business units that offer
different products and services, albeit to the same customer base. Most of the
technology business was acquired as a unit, and the management at the time of
acquisition was retained. The following table presents information about the

Note 12-Employee Benefit Plans
a Stock Compensation Plan
The Company established the 1994 Stock Option Plan for the benefit of certain
employees. As amended in May 1999, pursuant to this plan the Company may issue
up to approximately 5,180,000 shares of its Common Stock. The Plan provides for
two classes of options: Class A options and Class B options. A maximum of
237,897 shares of Common Stock may be covered by Class A options. Both incentive
and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the Plan.                    51            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

In 1995, Class A options to acquire 237,897 common shares were issued to
certain executive management at an exercise price of $421 per share,
substantially all of which became exercisable upon the closing of the Company
initial public offering which was on November 3, 1995. The exercise price of
all Class B options issued has been equal to the market price on the date of
grant and accordingly no compensation cost has been recognized. Substantially
all Class B options become exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of the date
of issuance, subject to acceleration upon termination of employment.
On May 8, 1996, the Company stockholders approved the 1996 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan, under which the Company may grant options to each
director who is not also an officer or employee of the Company, for up to 50,000
shares of the Company Common Stock. The exercise price and term, not to exceed
10 years, of each option is determined by the plan committee at the time of the
grant. During 1999, 1998 and 1997, 13,000, 3,000 and 2,000 options, respectively
were granted to certain non-employee directors at exercise prices which were
equal to the market price on the date of grant.
Additionally, in 1997 as a result of the Company acquisition of Sullivan
and MBMI, the Company assumed their respective stock option plans the Assumed
Plans. Options granted under the Assumed Plans are exercisable for up to ten
years from the date of grant at prices not less than the fair market value of
the respective acquirees' common stock at the date of grant, on a converted
basis.

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 and related interpretations
in accounting for its employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the market price of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company and its acquired
subsidiaries had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value
method of FAS 123. The weighted average fair value of options granted during
1999, 1998 and 1997 was $985, $1717 and $1768, respectively. The fair value
for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 1999,
1998 and 1997, risk-free interest rates of 56% for 1999 and 55% for 1998 and
1997; volatility factor of the expected market price of the Company Common
Stock of 458% for 1999 and 30% for 1998 and 1997, and a weighted-average
expected life of the option of 10 years.
Under the accounting provisions of FAS 123, the Company net income
loss and earnings loss per share for the years ended December 25, 1999,
December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997 would have been adjusted to the pro
forma amounts indicated below                                          1999     1998     1997

b Profit Sharing Plans
Prior to April 1, 1998, the Company had qualified contributory and
noncontributory 401k and profit sharing plans, respectively, for eligible
employees. As of April 1, 1998, the Company profit sharing plan was merged
into its 401k plan. Assets of the profit sharing plan are now held in
self-directed accounts within the 401k plan. Contributions to the plans were
determined by the Board of Directors and charged to operations during 1999, 1998
and 1997 amounted to $6,517, $6,033 and $5,300, respectively.
c Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP
In 1994, the Company established an ESOP and a related trust as a benefit
for substantially all of its domestic employees. This plan supplemented the
Company Profit Sharing Plan. Charges to operations related to this plan were
$2,283, $1,400 and $1,226 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Under this
plan, the Company issued 101,233 and 34,720 shares of the Company Common Stock
to the trust in 1999 and 1998 to satisfy the 1998 and 1997 contribution. The
Company expects to fund the 1999 contribution in 2000 with shares of the
Company Common Stock. As of April 1, 1998 the Company ESOP was merged into
its 401k plan. Shares of the Company Common Stock are held in trust by the
401k plan.
d Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
In 1994, the Company instituted an unfunded non-qualified supplemental
executive retirement plan for eligible employees. The increase in value which
was charged to operations, were $617, $283 and $112 for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively.

c  Litigation
The manufacture or distribution of certain products by the Company
involves a risk of product liability claims, and from time to time the Company
is named as a defendant in products liability cases as a result of its
distribution of pharmaceutical and other healthcare products. As of December 25,
1999, the Company was named a defendant in approximately fifty such cases. Of
these product liability claims, thirty-eight involve claims made by healthcare
workers who claim allergic reaction relating to exposure to latex gloves. In
each of these cases, the Company acted as a distributor of both brand name and
Henry Schein private brand latex gloves, which were manufactured by third
parties. To date, discovery in these cases has generally been limited to product
identification issues. The manufacturers in these cases have withheld
indemnification of the Company pending product identification; however, the
Company is taking steps to implead those manufacturers into each case in which
the Company is a defendant. The Company is also a named defendant in nine
lawsuits involving the sale of phentermine and fenfluramin. Plaintiffs in the
cases allege injuries from the combined use of the drugs known as Phen/fen.
The Company expects to obtain indemnification from the manufacturers of these
products, although this is dependent upon the financial viability of the
manufacturer and insurer.
In addition, the Company is subject to other claims, suits and complaints,
which arise in the course of the Company business. In Texas District Court,
Travis County, the Company, and one of its subsidiaries, are defendants in a
matter entitled Shelly E. Stromboe & Jeanne N. Taylor, on Behalf of Themselves
and All Other Similarly Situated vs. Henry Schein, Inc., Easy Dental Systems,
Inc. and Dentisoft, Inc. Case No. 98-00886. This complaint alleges among other
things, negligence, breach of contract, fraud and violations of certain Texas
Commercial Statutes involving the sale of certain practice management software
products sold prior to 1998 under the Easy Dental name. In October 1999, the
Court, on motion, certified both a Windows Sub-Class and a DOS Sub-Class to
proceed as a class action pursuant to Tex. R.Civ. P42. It is estimated that
5,000 Windows customers and 15,000 DOS customers could be covered by the judge
ruling. The Company has filed an appeal of the Court determination, during
which time a trial on the merits is stayed. The Company intends to vigorously
defend itself against this claim, as well as all other claims, suits and
complaints.                    55            HENRY SCHEIN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Company has various insurance policies, including product liability
insurance covering risks and in amounts it considers adequate. In many cases the
Company is provided by indemnification by the manufacturer of the product. There
can be no assurance that the coverage maintained by the Company is sufficient to
cover all future claims or will be available in adequate amounts or at a
reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide adequate
protection for the Company. The Company intends to vigorously defend all such
claims, suits and complaints. In the opinion of the Company, all such pending
matters are covered by insurance or are of such kind, or involve such amounts,
as would not have a material adverse effect on the financial statements of the
Company if disposed of unfavorably.
d  Employment, Consulting and Noncompete Agreements
The Company has employment, consulting and noncompete agreements expiring
through 2004 except for a lifetime consulting agreement with a principal
stockholder which provides for initial compensation of $283 per year, increasing
$25 every fifth year beginning in 2002. The agreements provide for varying base
aggregate annual payments of approximately $4,337 per year which decrease
periodically to approximately $424 per year. In addition, some agreements have
provisions for incentive and additional compensation.

Diluted      $ 015     $ 019        $ 006        $ 000    The Company business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly
influences. Net sales and operating profits are generally higher in the fourth
quarter due to timing of sales of software and equipment, year-end promotions
and purchasing patterns of office-based healthcare practitioners and are
generally lower in the first quarter due primarily to the increased purchases in
the prior quarter. Quarterly results also may be materially affected by a
variety of other factors, including the timing of acquisitions and related
costs, the release of software enhancements, timing of purchases, special
promotional campaigns, fluctuations in exchange rates associated with
international operations and adverse weather conditions. Diluted earnings per
share calculations for each quarter include the effect of stock options, when
dilutive to the quarter average number of shares outstanding for each period,
and therefore the sum of the quarters may not necessarily be equal to the full
year earnings per share amount.
During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company incurred incremental costs
totaling approximately $400 and reduced earnings from an affiliate totaling
approximately $1,300 net of taxes due to a voluntary recall of anesthetic
products produced by an affiliated company which is accounted for under the
equity method.                    57 Item 1.  Business    1
