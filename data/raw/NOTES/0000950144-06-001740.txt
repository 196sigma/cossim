Controls and Procedures   
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required financial disclosure. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation,
as required by Rule13a-15b under the Exchange Act, of
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act
Rule13a-15e as of December31, 2005. Based on this evaluation by management, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
December31, 2005, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.   
Managements Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term
is defined in Exchange Rule13a-15f. Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the framework and criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2005. Our independent registered public accounting firm,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, audited managements assessment
of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005 as stated in its report
which appears herein.   
Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting As discussed in previous 10-Q filings, we made numerous
personnel changes including hiring a new Chief Financial Officer
and additional managerial level finance and accounting resources
to perform supervisory review and monitoring activities. In
addition, we have improved the efficiency and effectiveness of
our financial closing process through automation, better
coordination with external parties, and better organization
within the finance and accounting function. As a result, we have
implemented additional managerial level finance and accounting
supervisory activities during the period-end financial reporting
process. As a result of these efforts, we have concluded that
the material weakness that existed at December31, 2004 was
fully remediated as of December31, 2005. Except as discussed above, there have been no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarter ended December31, 2005, that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 78 Table of Contents PARTIII The information called for by PartIII of

Inc.s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and
of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our
opinions, based on our audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1 present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of King
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31,
2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under a2 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in
Managements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting as of December31, 2005 appearing under
