NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. A, through its subsidiaries collectively,
A and its subsidiaries are referred to as Abercrombie & Fitch or the
Company, is a specialty retailer of high quality, casual apparel for
men, women and kids with an active, youthful lifestyle. The business was
established in 1892 and subsequently acquired by The Limited, Inc. The
Limited in 1988.
A was established as an independent Company through an initial public
offering the Offering which was consummated on October 1, 1996. As a
result of the Offering, 842% of the outstanding common stock of A was
owned by The Limited, until the completion of a tax-free exchange offer
the Exchange Offer on May 19, 1998.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the historical
financial statements of, and transactions applicable to, A and its
subsidiaries and reflect the assets, liabilities, results of operations
and cash flows on a historical cost basis.
2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A and all
significant subsidiaries that are more than 50% owned and controlled. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31.
Fiscal years are designated in the financial statements and notes by the
calendar year in which the fiscal year commences. The results for fiscal
years 2001 and 1999 represent the fifty-two week periods ended February
2, 2002 and January 29, 2000. The results for fiscal year 2000 represent
the fifty-three week period ended February 3, 2001.
CASH AND EQUIVALENTS
Cash and equivalents include amounts on deposit with financial
institutions and investments with original maturities of less than 90
days.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
All investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days are
accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities. The Company determines the appropriate
classification at the time of purchase. At February 2, 2002, the Company
held investments in marketable securities which were classified as held
to maturity based on the Company positive intent and ability to hold
the securities to maturity. All securities held by the Company at
February 2, 2002 were corporate debt securities which mature within one
year and are stated at amortized cost which approximates market value.
24    INVENTORIES
Inventories are principally valued at the lower of average cost or
market, on a first-in first-out basis, utilizing the retail method.
STORE SUPPLIES
The initial inventory of supplies for new stores including, but not
limited to, hangers, signage, security tags and point-of-sale supplies
are capitalized at the store opening date. Subsequent shipments are
expensed except for new merchandise presentation programs which are
capitalized.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are computed for
financial reporting purposes on a straight-line basis, using service
lives ranging principally from 10-15 years for leasehold improvements and
3-10 years for other property and equipment. Beneficial leaseholds
represent the present value of the excess of fair market rent over
contractual rent of existing stores at the 1988 purchase of the
Abercrombie & Fitch business by The Limited and are being amortized over
the lives of the related leases. The cost of assets sold or retired and
the related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the
accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Major
renewals and betterments that extend service lives are capitalized.
Long-lived assets are reviewed at the store level at least annually for
impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
full recoverability is questionable. Factors used in the evaluation
include, but are not limited to, management plans for future
operations, recent operating results and projected cash flows.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, which requires the use of the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the
difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to reverse. Under SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
Prior to the Exchange Offer, the Company was included in The Limited
consolidated federal and certain state income tax groups for income tax
reporting purposes and was responsible for its proportionate share of
income taxes calculated upon its federal taxable income at a current
estimate of the Company annual effective tax rate. Subsequent to the
Exchange Offer, the Company began filing its tax returns on a separate
basis.
SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The Board of Directors declared a two-for-one stock split on A Class
A Common Stock, distributed on June 15, 1999 to shareholders of record at
the close of business on May 25, 1999. All share and per share amounts in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have
been restated to reflect the stock split.
25    At February 2, 2002, there were 150 million shares of $01 par value
Class A Common Stock authorized, of which 989 million and 988 million
shares were outstanding at February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001,
respectively, and 1064 million shares of $01 par value Class B Common
Stock authorized, none of which were outstanding at February 2, 2002 or
February 3, 2001. In addition, 15 million shares of $01 par value
Preferred Stock were authorized, none of which have been issued. See Note
13 for information about Preferred Stock Purchase Rights.
Holders of Class A Common Stock generally have identical rights to
holders of Class B Common Stock, except that holders of Class A Common
Stock are entitled to one vote per share while holders of Class B Common
Stock are entitled to three votes per share on all matters submitted to a
vote of shareholders.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes retail sales at the time the customer takes
possession of the merchandise and purchases are paid for, primarily with
either cash or credit card. Catalogue and e-commerce sales are recorded
upon shipment of merchandise. Amounts relating to shipping and handling
billed to customers in a sale transaction are classified as revenue and
the related costs are classified as cost of goods sold. Employee
discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue. The Company reserves
for sales returns through estimates based on historical experience and
various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable.
CATALOGUE AND ADVERTISING COSTS
Costs related to the A Quarterly, a catalogue/magazine, primarily
consist of catalogue production and mailing costs and are expensed as
incurred. Advertising costs consist of in-store photographs and
advertising in selected national publications and are expensed when the
photographs or publications first appear. Catalogue and advertising costs
amounted to $307 million in 2001, $304 million in 2000 and $303
million in 1999.
STORE PREOPENING EXPENSES
Preopening expenses related to new store openings are charged to
operations as incurred.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The recorded values of current assets and current liabilities, including
receivables, marketable securities and accounts payable, approximate fair
value due to the short maturity and because the average interest rate
approximates current market origination rates.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Net income per share is computed in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings Per Share. Net income per basic share is computed based on the
weighted average number of outstanding shares of common stock. Net income
per diluted share includes the weighted average effect of dilutive stock
options and restricted shares.
26     Weighted Average Shares Outstanding thousands                                      2001      2000     1999

Diluted shares                          102,524    102,156    107,641
Options to purchase 5,630,000, 9,100,000 and 5,600,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock were outstanding at year-end 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively, but were not included in the computation of net income per
diluted share because the options' exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the underlying shares.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Since actual results
may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and
assumptions as new information becomes available.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation. The amounts reclassified did not have an effect on the
Company results of operations or shareholders' equity.
3.   ISSUANCES OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The standard is
effective starting with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001
February 3, 2002 for the Company. SFAS No. 142 addresses how intangible
assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition.
It also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be
accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial
statements. Management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 142 will
not have an impact on the Company results of operations or its
financial position.
SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 February 2,
2003 for the Company. The standard requires entities to record the fair
value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in
which it is a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related
long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the
useful life of the related obligation for its recorded amount or the
entity incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. Because costs associated
with exiting leased properties at the end of lease terms are minimal,
management anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 143 will not have a
significant effect on the Company results of operations or its
financial position.
SFAS No144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2001 February 3, 2002 for the Company, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The standard addresses financial accounting and
27    reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Management
anticipates that the adoption of SFAS No. 144 will not have an impact on
the Company results of operations or its financial position.

million and $126 million at February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001,
respectively.
Subsequent to the Exchange Offer, the Company began filing its tax
returns on a separate basis and made tax payments directly to taxing
authorities. Prior to the Exchange Offer, the Company was included in the
consolidated federal and certain state income tax groups of The Limited
for income tax purposes. Under this arrangement, the Company was
responsible for and paid The Limited its proportionate share of income
taxes, calculated upon its separate taxable income at the estimated
annual effective tax rate. Amounts paid to The Limited totaled $20
thousand, $829 thousand and
29    $91 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Amounts paid directly
to taxing authorities were $943 million, $1117 million and $811
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Net deferred income tax assets          $ 3,736       $19,490
No valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets because
management believes that it is more likely than not that the full amount
of the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
8.   LONG-TERM DEBT
The Company entered into a $150 million syndicated unsecured credit
agreement the Agreement on April 30, 1998. Borrowings outstanding
under the Agreement are due April 30, 2003. The Agreement has several
borrowing options, including interest rates that are based on the bank
agent Alternate Base Rate, a LIBO Rate or a rate submitted under a
bidding process. Facility fees payable under the Agreement are based on
the Company ratio the leverage ratio of the sum of total debt plus
800% of forward minimum rent commitments to trailing four-quarters
EBITDAR and currently accrues at 225% of the committed amount per annum.
The Agreement contains limitations on debt, liens, restricted payments
including dividends, mergers and acquisitions, sale-leaseback
transactions, investments, acquisitions, hedging transactions, and
transactions with affiliates. It also contains financial covenants
requiring a minimum ratio of EBITDAR to interest expense and minimum rent
and a maximum leverage ratio. No amounts were outstanding under the
Agreement at February 2, 2002 or February 3, 2001.
9.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Subsequent to the Exchange Offer, A and The Limited entered into
various service agreements for terms ranging from one to three years. A
hired associates with the appropriate expertise or contracted with
outside parties to replace those services which expired in May 1999.
Service agreements were also entered into for the continued use by the
Company of its distribution and home office space and transportation and
logistic services. The agreement for use of distribution space terminated
in April 2001. The agreements for home office space and transportation
and logistics services expired in May 2001. The cost of these services
generally was equal to The Limited cost in providing the relevant
services plus 5% of such costs.
30    Costs incurred to replace the services provided by The Limited did not
have a material adverse impact on the Company financial condition.
Shahid & Company, Inc. has provided advertising and design services for
the Company since 1995. Sam N. Shahid Jr., who serves on A Board of
Directors, has been President and Creative Director of Shahid & Company,
Inc. since 1993. Fees paid to Shahid & Company, Inc. for services
provided during fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999 were approximately $18
million, $17 million and $14 million, respectively.
On January 1, 2002, A loaned the amount of $4,953,833 to its Chairman
of the Board, a major shareholder of A, pursuant to the terms of a
replacement promissory note, which provides that such amount is due and
payable on December 31, 2002. If A records net sales of at least
$1,156,100,000 during the period from February 3, 2002 through November
30, 2002, the outstanding principal under the note will not bear
interest. If A does not record net sales exceeding that threshold, the
outstanding principal under the note will bear interest from January 1,
2002 at the rate of 45% per annum. This note constitutes a replacement
of, and substitute for, the replacement promissory note dated as of May
18, 2001 in the amount of $4,817,146, which has been cancelled. The
replacement promissory note dated May 18, 2001 constituted a replacement
of, and substitute for, the replacement promissory note dated as of
August 28, 2000 in the amount of $45 million. The replacement promissory
note dated August 28, 2000 constituted a replacement of, and substitute
for, the promissory note dated March 1, 2000 and the replacement
promissory note dated May 19, 2000 in the amounts of $15 million and
$30 million, respectively. The replacement promissory note dated May 19,
2000 constituted a replacement of, and substitute for, the promissory
note dated as of November 17, 1999 in the amount of $15 million.
10.  STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED SHARES
Under A stock plans, associates and non-associate directors may be
granted up to a total of 213 million restricted shares and options to
purchase A common stock at the market price on the date of grant. In
2001, associates of the Company were granted approximately 600 thousand
options, with vesting periods from four to five years. A total of 84,000
options were granted to non-associate directors in 2001, all of which
vest over four years. All options have a maximum term of ten years.
The Company adopted the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, in 1996, but elected to
continue to measure compensation expense in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Accordingly, no compensation expense for stock options has
been recognized. If compensation expense had been determined based on the
estimated fair value of options granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
consistent with the methodology in SFAS No. 123, the pro forma effect
on net income and net income per diluted share would have been a
reduction of approximately $206 million or $20 per share in 2001,
$200 million or $20 per share in 2000 and $185 million or $17 per
share in 1999. The weighted-average fair value of all options granted
during fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $1496, $890 and $2334,
respectively. The fair value of each option was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999: no expected dividends; price
volatility of 54% in 2001, 50% in 2000 and 45% in 1999; risk-free
interest rates of 47%, 62% and 60% in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively; assumed forfeiture rates of 15% in 2001 and 10% in 2000 and
1999; and expected lives of 5 years in 2001 and 2000 and 65 years in
1999.
The pro forma effect on net income for 2001, 2000 and 1999 is not
representative of the pro forma effect on net income in future years
because it takes into consideration pro forma compensation expense
related only to those grants made subsequent to the Offering.

A total of 19,000, 102,000 and 140,000 restricted shares were granted in
2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, with a total market value at grant
date of $6 million, $23 million and $54 million, respectively. The
restricted share grants generally vest either on a graduated scale over
four years or 100% at the end of a fixed vesting period, principally five
years. The market value of restricted shares is being amortized as
compensation expense over the vesting period, generally four to five
years. Compensation expenses related to restricted share awards amounted
to $39 million, $43 million and $52 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
11.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company participates in a qualified defined contribution retirement
plan and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan. Participation in
the qualified plan is available to all associates who have completed
1,000 or more hours of service with the Company during certain 12-month
periods and attained the age of 21. Participation in the nonqualified
plan is subject to service and compensation requirements. The Company
contributions to these plans are based on a percentage of associates'
eligible annual compensation. The cost of these plans was $39 million in
2001, $30 million in 2000 and $26 million in 1999.
32 12.  CONTINGENCIES
The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings. Although it is
not possible to predict with any certainty the eventual outcome of any
legal proceedings, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate
resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on the
Company results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
13.  PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS
On July 16, 1998, A Board of Directors declared a dividend of 50 of
a Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock Purchase Right
