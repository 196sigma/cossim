All other financial statement schedules are omitted because they

LanVision Systems, Inc. as of January31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended January31, 2005. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule of
LanVision Systems, Inc. listed in a. These
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of LanVision Systems, Inc. at
January31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January31, 2005, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth herein. Cincinnati, Ohio

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies LanVision Systems, Inc. the Company operates in one segment as
a provider of Healthcare Information Technology through the
licensing of its Electronic Medical Record, Patient Financial
Services and other Workflow software applications and the use of
such applications through its application-hosting services as an
Application Service Provider. LanVisions products enable
hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery systems in the
United States to capture, store, manage, route, retrieve, and
process vast amounts of patient clinical, financial and other
healthcare provider information. Fiscal Year All references to a fiscal year refer to the fiscal year
commencing February 1 in that calendar year and ending on
January 31 of the following year. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
LanVision Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary, LanVision, Inc. All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004, LanVision
recorded a $300,000 favorable change in the estimate for the
allowance for doubtful accounts and miscellaneous reserves. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003, LanVision recorded a
$290,000 favorable change in the estimate for certain franchise
tax liabilities as a result of the tax authority audit of
certain prior years tax returns. Revenue Recognition Revenue is derived from: the licensing and sale of systems,
either directly to end-users or through third-party resellers,
comprising internally developed software, third-party software
and hardware components; product support, maintenance and
professional services; and application-hosting services that
provide high quality, transaction or subscription based document
imaging/management services from a central data center.
LanVisions revenue recognition policies conform to
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.
Generally, revenue from software license fees and hardware sales
to end-users is recognized when a master agreement is signed and
products are made available to end-users. Revenues from
agreements that contain multiple-element arrangements are
allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the
elements. Revenues related to routine installation and
integration and project management are deferred until the work
is performed. If a contract requires LanVision to perform
services and modifications that are deemed significant to system
acceptance, revenues are recorded either on the
percentage-of-completion method or revenues related to the
delivered hardware and software components are deferred until
such obligations are deemed insignificant, depending on the
contractual terms. LanVision follows this method since
reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs
applicable to various stages of a contract can be made.
Recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the
contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates
are charged or credited to income in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known. Revenues from
consulting, education, and application-hosting services are
recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from
short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized
ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings to customers
recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as
deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to progress
billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables. 37 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with IDX Information
Systems Corporation, royalties are remitted by IDX to LanVision
based upon IDX sublicensing LanVisions software to
IDXs customers. Thirty percent of the royalty is due
45days following the end of the month in which IDX
executes an end-user license agreement with its customer.
LanVision recognizes this revenue upon receipt of the royalty
report. The remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due from
IDX, in varying amounts based on implementation milestones,
45days following the end of the month in which a milestone
occurs. LanVision records this revenue when the seventy percent
payment due from IDX is fixed and determinable, which is
generally when the products are made available to end-users. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits, overnight
deposits, and short-term commercial paper. The long-term debt
agreement See Note3 requires LanVision to maintain a
minimum cash balance of $2,000,000 through the earlier of the
repayment or maturity of the loan in July, 2007. Receivables Accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed
LanVision for licensed software, professional services,
including maintenance services and application-hosting
activities and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$200,000 at January31, 2005 and $400,000 at
January31, 2004. Contracts with individual customers and
resellers determine when receivables are due. In determining the
allowance for doubtful accounts, each unpaid receivable is
reviewed quarterly with the appropriate LanVision Client Manager
to determine the payment status based upon the most currently
available information as to the status of the receivables, the
customer comments, if any, and the status of any open or
unresolved issues with the customer preventing the payment
thereof. Corrective action, if necessary, is taken by LanVision
to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables. During
these quarterly reviews, LanVision determines the required
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting
from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or
resellers to make required payments. Concentrations Financial instruments, which potentially expose LanVision to
concentrations of credit risk, as defined by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No105, Disclosure of
Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit
Risk, consist primarily of accounts receivable.
LanVisions accounts receivable are concentrated in the
healthcare industry. However, LanVisions customers
typically have been well-established hospitals, medical
facilities, or major Health Information Systems companies that
resell LanVisions products that have good credit histories
and payments have been received within normal time frames for
the industry. However, some hospitals and medical facilities
have experienced significant operating losses as a result of
limits on third-party reimbursements from insurance companies
and governmental entities and extended payment of receivables
from these entities is not uncommon. To date, LanVision has relied on a limited number of customers
and remarketing partners for a substantial portion of its total
revenues. LanVision expects that a significant portion of its
future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited
number of customers and its remarketing partners. The failure to
obtain new customers or expand sales through remarketing
partners, the loss of existing customers or reduction in
revenues from existing customers could materially and adversely
affect LanVisions operating results See Note6. LanVision currently buys all of its hardware and some major
software components of its Healthcare Information Systems from
third-party vendors. Although there are a limited number of
vendors capable of supplying these components, management
believes that other suppliers could provide similar components on 38 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however, could cause a
delay in system implementations and a possible loss of revenues,
which could adversely affect operating results. Other Current Assets Other current assets are primarily: prepaid insurance,
commissions, maintenance, deposits, deferred Federal income tax
assets relating to the net operating loss carryforward and
prepaid expenses related to future revenues. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
computed using the straight-line depreciation, over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful
lives are as follows   
Computer equipment and software
2-4years
Office equipment
5years
Office furniture and fixtures
7years
Leasehold improvements
Life of lease
Depreciation expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $514,149 534,499 and $383,806, respectively. Leased computer equipment and software meeting certain criteria
are capitalized and the present value of the related lease
payments is recorded as a liability. Depreciation of the
capitalized lease assets is computed on the straight-line method
over the term of the lease. Normal repair and maintenance is expensed as incurred.
Replacements are capitalized and the property and equipment
accounts are relieved of the items being replaced or disposed
of, or if no longer of value. The related cost and accumulated
deprecation of the disposed assets are eliminated and any gain
or loss on disposition is included in the results of operations
in the year of disposal. Capitalized Software Development Costs Software development costs are accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No86,
Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased or
Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the planning and
designing phase of software development, including coding and
testing activities necessary to establish technological
feasibility are classified as product research and development
and are expensed as incurred. Once technological feasibility has
been determined, a portion of the costs incurred in development,
including coding, testing, and product quality assurance, are
capitalized and subsequently reported at the lower of
unamortized cost or net realizable value. LanVision capitalized
$999,996, $800,000 and $600,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Research and development expense, net of capitalized amounts,
was $2,061,207, $2,053,901 and $2,195,315 in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product basis over the
estimated economic life of the software, not to exceed three
years, using the straight-line method. Amortization commences
when a product is available for general release to customers.
Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the
net realizable value of a product are expensed at the date of
such determination. Amortization expense was $633,000, $500,000
and $400,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Other non-current assets Other non-current assets at January31, 2005 consist
primarily of deferred tax assets relating to the net operating
loss carry forwards See Note4. 39 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Accrued Other Expenses Accrued other expenses at January31, 2005 and 2004 include
warranty reserves, accrued franchise and property taxes,
professional fees and other similar liabilities. Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes are accounted for in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of Statement109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Stock Options Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, establishes a
fair value method of financial accounting and reporting for
stock-based compensation plans. LanVision elected to continue to
account for stock options under the intrinsic value method
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and,
accordingly, has adopted the disclosure only provisions of
Statement123. At January31, 2005 LanVision had three
stock-based compensation plans, which are more fully disclosed
in Note7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. No stock-based compensation cost is reflected in the
net earnings, as all options granted under the plans had
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. The table below illustrates
the effect on net earnings and earnings per share as if
LanVision had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, to
stock-based employee compensation. The company is requires to adopt the revised standards of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, effective the
third quarter of fiscal year 2005. At the present time the
company has not determined the impact on future earnings. Pro forma information regarding the net earnings and net
earnings per common share is required by the current
Statement123, and has been determined as if LanVision had
accounted for its stock options under the fair value method of
that Statement. The fair value of these options was estimated at
the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal year
2004 risk-free interest rate of 425%, and 2003 risk-free
interest rate of 250%; a dividend yield of zero percent; a
volatility factor of the expected market price of
LanVisions Common Stock of 864 in 2004 and 916 in 2003,
and a weighted average expected life of the options of five
years. No options were granted in 2002. 40 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because LanVisions stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can
materially affect the fair value estimate, in LanVisions
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options.

The pro forma disclosures are not likely to be representative of

with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128,
Earnings per Share. The basic net earnings per common
share are computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each period. The diluted net
earnings per common share reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if Stock Options, Stock Purchase Plan commitments
and Warrants were exercised into Common Stock, under certain

through fiscal year 2006. Future minimum lease payments under
noncancelable operating leases for the next five fiscal years
are as follows: 2005, $259,380; 2006, $320,589; 2007, $323,268;
2008, $315,486; 2009, $337,209 each year. Rent expense was
$252,664, $229,275 and $178,189 for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.   
3.
Long-term Debt and Capitalized Leases In July 2004, the LanVision entered into a new three year
working capital term loan agreement. The long-term debt of
$2,000,000 is secured by all of the assets of LanVision and the
loan agreement restricts LanVision from incurring additional
indebtedness for borrowed money, including capitalized leases,
etc. without lender consent. The loan is repayable in two
remaining annual installments, which are due and payable of not
less than $833,333 by July30, 2006 and $1,166,667 by
July30, 2007 and interest is payable quarterly, at the
bank prime rate plus 2% at year end 75%. In addition,
LanVision is required to meet certain financial covenants,
including; minimum level of tangible net worth, fixed charge
coverage ratio and funded indebtedness to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Also, LanVision
has agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $2,000,000
through the earlier of the repayment or maturity of the loan on
July31, 2007. LanVision complied with all of the
provisions of its loan agreements during the period except for
the Funded Indebtedness to EBITDA ratio of not greater than
150. At October31, 2004 the ratio was 158 and the lender
has granted a waiver of the requirement through the fiscal year
end. In 1998, LanVision issued a $6,000,000 note. In connection with
the issuance of the note, LanVision issued Warrants to
purchase750,000shares of Common Stock of LanVision
at $387per share at any time through July16, 2008.
The Warrants are subject to customary antidilution and
registration rights provisions. 42 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued LanVision believes the fair market value of the long-term debt
approximates the carrying value based on the term, interest rate
and maturity that LanVision believes is currently available to
it. During fiscal year 2002, LanVision acquired computer equipment
and related software for a new application-hosting services data
center, which are accounted for as capitalized leases. The
amount of the leased assets by category is: computer equipment
$372,705; computer software $196,799; and prepaid maintenance
and expenses $84,626, for a total of $654,130 in new assets. The
leases are payable monthly in installments of $19,991, through
August 2005 and an additional amount of $8,323, through December
2005. The present value of the future lease payments upon lease
inception was $654,130 using the interest rates implicit in the
lease agreements at the inception of the leases. The following is an analysis of the assets under capital lease
at the fiscal year end

in 2005. The total obligations of the minimum lease payments,
less the amount representing interest of $5,112 is reflected in
the balance sheet as a current obligation of $168,121.

Income Taxes In 2004, 2003 and 2002, LanVision was subject to Alternative
Minimum Taxes. The income tax benefit provisionfor income taxes differs

During fiscal year 2003, LanVision determined that a portion of
the Federal net operating loss carry forward would not be
recognized totaling $2,058,394 $888,822 tax-benefit. An
adjustment of $888,822 was required to record the net operating
loss carry forward deferred tax asset to the appropriate amount.
As the net operating loss carry forward had a full valuation
allowance recorded in the prior year, there was no impact on the
Consolidated Statement of Income in 2003 resulting from this
adjustment; however, the adjustment is a component of the 2003
effective tax rate reconciliation. 43 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued LanVision provides deferred income taxes for temporary
differences between assets and liabilities recognized for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. The income tax
effects of these temporary differences are as follows

In all fiscal years prior to 2003, LanVision established a full
valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets. As
of January31, 2005, LanVision reduced the valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets primarily related to the
carry forward by $978,000 based upon reasonable future earnings
before income tax projections. A valuation allowance of
$9,735,034 is still required to reduce the deferred tax assets,
primarily relating to loss carry forwards, to a level currently
believed will be utilized to offset future earnings before
income taxes based upon the current backlog and forecasts over
the next two years. The valuation allowance is required due to
the inability to predict on a longer term basis that LanVision
will more likely than not attain levels of
profitability required to utilize additional loss carry forwards. At January31, 2005, LanVision had a net operating loss
carry forward of approximately $29,000,000, which begins to
expire in 2010. LanVision also has an Alternative Minimum Tax
credit carry forward of approximately $48,000, which has an
unlimited carry forward period. Certain changes in stock
ownership can result in a limitation on the amount of net
operating loss carry forward that can be utilized each year.   
5.
Retirement Plan LanVision has established a 401k retirement plan that covers
substantially all employees. Company contributions to the plan
may be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors. To
date, no Company contributions have been made to the plan.   
6.
Major Customers During fiscal year 2004, three customers, exclusive of our
remarketing partners, accounted for 13%, 13%, and 7% of total

our remarketing partners, accounted for 12%, 6%, and 5% of total
revenues. During fiscal year 2002, three customers, exclusive of

revenues. At January31, 2005 and 2004, 40% and 38 respectively, of LanVisions accounts receivable were due
from three customers excluding remarketing partners. At
January31, 2005 and 2004 approximately, 30% and 34 respectively, of LanVisions accounts receivables were due
from remarketing partners. 44 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

representing 20% or more of the total of all of LanVisions
then outstanding voting securities, unless through a transaction
arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval of the Board

Commitments and Contingencies Maintenance Agreements, Warranties, and Indemnities LanVision warrants to customers that its software will meet
certain performance requirements for an initial limited warranty
period. LanVision has maintenance agreements to provide services
in future periods after the expiration of the initial limited
warranty period. LanVision invoices customers in accordance with
the agreements and records the invoicing as deferred revenues
and recognizes the revenues ratably over the term of the
maintenance agreements. LanVisions standard agreements
with its customers usually include intellectual property
infringement indemnification provisions to indemnify them from
and against third-party claims, and for liabilities, damages,
and expenses arising out of LanVisions operation of its
business or any negligent act or omission of LanVision. Application-hosting Services LanVision enters into long-term agreements to provide document
imaging/management and workflow services to its healthcare
customers on an outsourced basis from a central data center.
LanVision guarantees specific up-time and
response time performance standards, which, if not
met may result in reduced revenues, as a penalty, for the month
in which the standards are not met. Employment Agreements LanVision has entered into employment agreements with its
officers and employees that generally provide annual salary, a
minimum bonus, discretionary bonus, stock incentive provisions,
and severance arrangements. Reserved Common Stock LanVision has reserved 1,181,525shares of the Common Stock
authorized for issuance in connection with various Stock Option
and Employee Stock Purchase Plans, and 750,000shares for
the Warrants issued in connection with the 1998 long-term debt. Litigation There are, from time to time, claims pending against LanVision
and its subsidiary. Based on a review of such litigation with
legal counsel, LanVision believes any resulting liability would
not have a material affect on LanVisions consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 46 Table of Contents NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
