or not required or because the information required to
be shown is included in the Consolidated Financial
Statements or the accompanying Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. 32 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO SIGCORP, Inc.   We have audited the consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated statements of capitalization of SIGCORP, Inc.
an Indiana corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of
income, common shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999.
These financial statements and the supplemental schedule
referred to below are the responsibility of SIGCORP, Inc.
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and supplemental schedule based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of SIGCORP, Inc. as of December 31,
1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The supplemental schedule listed under Item 8 3 is
presented for the purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This supplemental schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.                  ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

TO SOUTHERN INDIANA GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY   We have audited the balance sheets and statements of
capitalization of SOUTHERN INDIANA GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY
an Indiana corporation as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the related statements of income, retained earnings and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999. These financial statements and the
supplemental schedule referred to below are the
responsibility of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and supplemental
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric
Company as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an
opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
The supplemental schedule listed under Item 8 3 is
presented for the purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of the basic
financial statements. This supplemental schedule has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits
of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.                ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SIGCORP AND SIGECO
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION SIGCORP, Inc. SIGCORP, an
Indiana holding company, has 11 wholly-owned subsidiaries:
Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company SIGECO, a gas
and electric utility which accounts for over 80% of
SIGCORP net income for the twelve months ended December
31, 1999, and ten nonregulated subsidiaries.
On June 14, 1999, SIGCORP announced an agreement to merge
with Indiana Energy, Inc. IEI in an all-stock pooling
transaction through which a new holding company, Vectren
Corporation, would be formed. In a tax-free exchange,
SIGCORP shareholders would receive one and one-third shares
of Vectren stock for each share of SIGCORP stock, while IEI
shares would be exchanged on a one-for-one basis. SIGCORP
and IEI are proceeding to obtain the necessary regulatory
approvals and completion of the merger is expected by the
end of the first quarter of 2000. Transaction and related
costs incurred by SIGCORP through December 31, 1999 were
$5,506,000 and have been deferred.
SIGECO, which has no subsidiaries, is a regulated gas and
electric utility is engaged principally in the production,
purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity
and the delivery of natural gas. SIGECO serves 126,605
electric customers in the city of Evansville and 74 other
communities and serves 109,388 gas customers in the city of
Evansville and 64 other communities.
Energy Systems Group, Inc. ESGI has a one-third ownership
in Energy Systems Group, LLC, an energy-related performance
contracting firm serving industrial and commercial
customers. Southern Indiana Minerals, Inc. SIMI processes
and markets coal combustion by-products. Southern Indiana
Properties, Inc. SIPI invests in leveraged leases of real
estate and equipment, real estate partnerships and joint
ventures, and private placement subordinated debt
instruments. Cash balances are invested in marketable
securities. SIGCORP Energy Services, Inc. Energy was
established to market energy and related services and is
currently providing natural gas, pipeline management,
storage service and other natural gas-related services to
SIGECO, other utilities and endusers. SIGCORP Capital, Inc.
Capital is the primary financing vehicle for SIGCORP
nonregulated subsidiaries. SIGCORP Fuels, Inc. Fuels was
formed to provide coal and related services to SIGECO and
other customers. SIGCORP Power Marketing, Inc. Power, not
yet active, was formed to procure electric power supplies
for SIGECO and other customers, and will market SIGECO
excess electric generation capacity. SIGCORP Communications
Services Communications was formed to undertake
telecommunications-related strategic initiatives. SIGCORP
Environmental Services, Inc. Environmental Services holds
SIGCORP investment in Air Quality Services, a joint
venture created to provide air quality monitoring and
testing services to industry and utilities. SIGECO Advanced
Communications, Inc. Advanced Communications holds
SIGCORP investment in SIGECOM, LLC and Utilicom Networks,
Inc. Utilicom. SIGECOM, LLC, is a joint venture between
Advanced Communications and Utilicom to provide and market
enhanced communications services over a high capacity fiber
optic network in a multi-state area encompassing SIGECO
service territory. Effective June 30, 1998, ComSource,
Inc., a former subsidiary of SIGCORP, was merged into
Advanced Communications. All significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
REGULATION The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission IURC
has jurisdiction over all investor-owned gas and electric
utilities in Indiana. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission FERC has jurisdiction over those investor-owned
utilities that make wholesale energy sales. These agencies
regulate SIGECO utility business operations, rates,
accounts, depreciation allowances, services, security issues
and the sale and acquisition of properties. The financial
statements of SIGCORP and SIGECO are based on generally
accepted accounting principles, which give recognition to
the ratemaking and accounting practices of these agencies.
49
REGULATORY ASSETS SIGECO is subject to the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.
Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to
SIGECO associated with certain incurred costs which will be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process.
Generally accepted accounting principles for rate regulated
companies also require that regulatory assets which are no
longer probable of recovery through future revenues, at the
balance sheet date, be charged to earnings. The following
regulatory assets are reflected in the financial statements At December 31 in thousands           1999    1998
Regulatory Assets:
Demand side management program costs     $ 25,900  $ 25,648
Postretirement benefits other than
pensions                   1,234    3,263
Unamortized premium on reacquired debt      4,416    4,705
Regulatory study costs               21     107

Less current amounts               7,921    9,527
Total long-term regulatory assets      $ 29,235  $ 30,127
Refer to the individual paragraphs in this Note for discussion of
specific regulatory assets. See Income Taxes for regulatory assets and
liabilities related to income taxes. As of December 31, 1999, the recovery of $15,762,000 of
SIGECO total regulatory assets is reflected in rates
charged to customers. The remaining $21,373,000 of
regulatory assets, which are not yet included in rates,
represent SIGECO demand side management DSM costs
incurred after 1993. When SIGECO files its next electric
rate case, these costs will be included in rate base and
earn a return; amortization of these costs over a period
anticipated to be 15 years will be recovered through rates
as a cost of operations. Of the $15,762,000 of regulatory
assets currently reflected in rates, a total of $8,943,000
is earning a return: $4,527,000 of pre-1994 DSM costs and
$4,416,000 of unamortized premium on reacquired debt. The
remaining recovery periods for the DSM costs and premium on
reacquired debt are 105 years and 19 years, respectively.
The remaining $6,819,000 of regulatory assets included in
rates but not earning a return are being recovered over
varying periods: $1,234,000 of deferred postretirement
benefit costs, over 1 year; $3,869,000 of fuel costs, over 3
months; and $1,716,000 of gas costs, over 12 months.
If all or a separable portion of SIGECO operations becomes
no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS No. 71, a write
off of related regulatory assets would be required, unless
some form of transition cost recovery continues through
rates established and collected for SIGECO remaining
regulated operations that would meet the requirements under
generally accepted accounting principles for continued
accounting as regulatory assets during such recovery period.
In addition, SIGECO would be required to determine any
impairment to the carrying costs of deregulated plant and
inventory assets.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  SIGECO customer receivables
from gas and electric sales and gas transportation services
are primarily derived from a diversified base of
residential, commercial and industrial customers located in
a southwestern region of Indiana. SIGECO continually
reviews customers' creditworthiness and requests deposits or
refunds deposits based on that review. SIGECO also sells
electricity to wholesale marketers which increases its
exposure to potential credit losses. Energy customer
receivables from gas sales and transportation services are
primarily derived from a diversified base of commercial and
industrial customers located in the midwestern region of the
United States. Energy investigates the creditworthiness of
its potential customers. See Note 2 for a discussion of
receivables related to SIPI leveraged lease investments.
UTILITY PLANT Utility plant is stated at the historical
original cost of construction. The cost of repairs and
minor renewals is charged to maintenance expense as
incurred. Property unit replacements are capitalized and
the depreciation reserve is charged with the cost, less net
salvage, of units retired.
50
DEPRECIATION Depreciation of utility property is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated service
lives of the depreciable plant. Provisions for
depreciation, expressed as an annual percentage of the cost
of average depreciable plant in service, were as follows                       1999   1998  1997

method of accounting for income taxes, providing deferred
taxes on temporary differences. Investment tax credits have
been deferred and are amortized through credits to income

defined benefit plans which cover eligible full-time regular
employees. The plans provide retirement benefits based on
years of service and the employee highest 60 consecutive
months' compensation during the last 120 months of
employment. The funding policy of SIGECO is to contribute
amounts to the plans equal to at least the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 ERISA but not in excess of the maximum deductible
for federal income tax purposes. The plans' assets as of
December 31, 1999 consist of investments in interest-bearing
obligations and common stocks.

Net periodic benefit cost             $ 1,729  $  1,387 The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1999 and
1998 was determined using an assumed discount rate of 75%
and 70%, respectively. For both periods, the long-term
rate of compensation increases was assumed to be 50%, and
the long-term rate of return on plan assets was assumed to
be 80%. The transitional asset is being amortized over
approximately 15, 18 and 14 years for the Salaried, Hourly
and Hoosier plans, respectively.
On January 1, 1999 SIGECO amended its pension plans by
increasing the monthly earnings multiplier applied to all
credited years of service in the plans' benefit formulas.
These amendments increased unrecognized prior service costs.
In addition to the trusteed pension plans discussed above,
SIGECO provides supplemental pension benefits to certain
current and former officers under nonqualified and nonfunded
plans. The accrued pension liability for these plans at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 was $4,648,000 and $3,820,000,
respectively. Service cost related to these benefits for
the year ended December 31, 1999 was approximately
$1,000,000.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS SIGECO provides
certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees and their dependents through
a combination of self-insured and fully-insured plans. In
1998, SIGECO amended these benefits for salaried employees
aged 49 years and younger to require retiree contributions
towards the related health care insurance costs. SFAS No.
106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions, requires the expected cost of these
benefits be recognized during the
52
employees' years of service. As authorized by the IURC,
SIGECO deferred as a regulatory asset the additional SFAS
No. 106 costs accrued over the costs of benefits actually
paid after date of adoption, but prior to inclusion in
rates. Subsequently, the IURC authorized SIGECO to include
in rates SFAS No. 106 costs and to recover the amounts
previously deferred over a 60-month period.

postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1999 and
1998 included discount rates of 75% and 70%, respectively.
As of December 31, 1999 the health care cost trend rate is
80% declining to 45% in 2006. The accrued health care cost
trend rate for 2000 is 70%. The estimated cost of these
future benefits could be significantly affected by future
changes in health care costs, work force demographics,
interest rates or plan changes. A 10% increase in the
assumed health care cost trend rate each year would increase
the aggregate service and interest costs for 1999 by
$382,000 and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $3,606,000. A 10% decrease in the assumed
health care cost trend rate each year would decrease the
aggregate service and interest costs for 1999 by $307,000
and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$2,952,000.
54
On July 1, 1998, SIGECO amended its postretirement benefit
plans to change benefits for existing employees under fifty
years of age and new employees to a graduated benefit rate.
SIGECO has adopted Voluntary Employee Beneficiary
Association VEBA Trust Agreements for the funding of
postretirement health benefits for retirees and their
eligible dependents and beneficiaries. Annual funding is
discretionary and is based on the projected cost over time
of benefits to be provided to covered persons consistent
with acceptable actuarial methods. To the extent these
postretirement benefits are funded, the benefits will not be
shown as a liability on SIGECO financial statements.
CASH FLOW INFORMATION For balance sheet and cash flow
purposes, SIGCORP and SIGECO consider all highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
During 1999, 1998 and 1997, SIGCORP paid interest net of
amounts capitalized of $19,777,000, $21,900,000 and
$19,888,000, respectively, and income taxes of $19,990,000 27,594,000 and $29,552,000, respectively. SIGCORP is
involved in several partnerships which are partially
financed by partnership obligations amounting to $845,000
and $2,358,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
During 1999, 1998 and 1997, SIGECO paid interest net of
amounts capitalized of $15,437,000, $18,484,000 and
$18,929,000, respectively, and income taxes of $25,476,000 23,789,000 and $35,239,000, respectively.
INVENTORIES SIGECO accounts for inventories under the
average cost method except for gas in underground storage
which is accounted for under the last-in, first-out LIFO
method. Energy accounts for gas in underground storage
under the lower of cost or market method. SIGCORP, Inc.At December 31 in thousands      1999    1998

Total inventories                  $ 41,459  $ 46,659 Based on the December 1999 price of gas purchased, the cost
of replacing SIGECO current portion of gas in underground
storage at December 31, 1999 exceeded the amount stated on a
LIFO basis by approximately $12,000,000.
OPERATING REVENUES AND FUEL COSTS SIGECO accrues an
estimate of revenues unbilled for electric and gas service
furnished from the meter reading dates to the end of each
accounting period. All metered gas rates contain a gas cost
adjustment clause which allows for adjustment in charges for
changes in the cost of purchased gas. Metered electric
rates typically contain a fuel adjustment clause which
allows for adjustment in charges for electric energy to
reflect changes in the cost of fuel and the net energy cost
of purchased power. SIGECO also collects through a
quarterly rate adjustment mechanism, the margin on electric
sales lost due to the implementation of demand side
management programs.
55
SIGECO records any adjustment clause under-or overrecovery
each month in revenues. A corresponding asset or liability
is recorded until such time as the under-or overrecovery is
billed or refunded to its customers. The cost of gas sold
is charged to operating expense as delivered to customers
and the cost of fuel for electric generation is charged to
operating expense when consumed.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income is a measure of
all changes in equity of an enterprise which result from
transactions or other economic events during the period
other than transactions with shareholders. This information
is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Common
Shareholders' Equity. SIGCORP components of accumulated
other comprehensive income loss includes unrealized gains
losses on available for sale securities. SIGECO has no
elements of other comprehensive income.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities, which is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000, but may be adopted earlier.
The June 15, 1999 date was amended by SFAS No. 137 to June
15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, be recorded on Consolidated Balance Sheets as
either an asset or liability measured at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting
designation.
SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative fair
value be recognized in the current period earnings, unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If an entity
qualifies for hedge accounting, gains and losses on
derivatives, generally, will offset the related effects of
the hedged items in the current period income statement.
SFAS No. 133 requires that formal documentation be
maintained and that the effectiveness of the hedge be
assessed quarterly.
SIGCORP and SIGECO have not yet quantified the effects of
adopting SFAS No. 133 on their financial statements and have
not determined the timing or method of their adoption of
this statement. However, adoption of SFAS No. 133 could
increase the volatility in earnings and other comprehensive
income.
NOTE 2 LEVERAGED LEASES
SIGCORP
SIPI is a lessor in several leveraged lease agreements under
which an office building, a part of a reservoir, a gas
turbine electric generating peaking unit, two heat and power
generating facilities and passenger railroad cars are leased
to third parties. In early 1998, SIPI sold its leveraged
lease in a paper mill. In 1999 SIPI entered into two new
leveraged leases in the Netherlands and Belgium. The
economic lives and lease terms vary with the leases. The
total equipment and facilities cost was approximately
$409,700,000 and $86,700,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The cost of the equipment and facilities was
partially financed by nonrecourse debt provided by lenders,
who have been granted an assignment of rentals due under the
leases and a security interest in the leased property, which
they accepted as their sole remedy in the event of default
by the lessee. Such debt amounted to approximately
$373,500,000 and $66,700,000 at December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. SIGCORP net investment in leveraged leases
at those dates was $55,037,000 and $10,673,000,
respectively, as shown At December 31 in thousands             1999    1998

NOTE 3 SHORT-TERM FINANCING
SIGCORP and SIGECO
SIGECO has trust demand note arrangements totaling
$17,000,000 with several banks, of which none was utilized
at December 31, 1999. Funds are also borrowed periodically
from banks on a short-term basis, made available through
lines of credit. SIGCORP has available lines of credit

SIGCORP and SIGECO
The annual sinking fund requirement of SIGECO first
mortgage bonds is 1% of the greatest amount of bonds
outstanding under the Mortgage Indenture. This requirement
may be satisfied by certification to the Trustee of unfunded
property additions in the prescribed amount as provided in
the Mortgage Indenture. SIGECO intends to meet the 2000
sinking fund requirement by this means and, accordingly, the
sinking fund requirement for 2000 is excluded from current
liabilities on the balance sheet. At December 31, 1999 200,011,000 of SIGECO utility plant remained unfunded
under SIGECO Mortgage Indenture.
Several of SIGCORP partnership investments have been
financed through obligations with such partnerships. Of the
amount of first mortgage bonds, notes payable and
partnership obligations outstanding at December 31, 1999,
the following amounts which mature in the five years
subsequent to 1999 are as follows                    SIGCORP     SIGECO

SIGCORP and SIGECO
COMMON STOCK Each outstanding share of SIGCORP common
stock contains a right which entitles registered holders to
purchase from SIGCORP one-hundredth of a share of SIGCORP
common stock, at an initial price of $65 per share Purchase
Price subject to adjustment. The rights will not be
exercisable until a party acquires beneficial ownership of
10% of common shares or makes a tender offer for at least
10% of its common shares. The rights expire December 31,
2005. If not exercisable, the rights in whole may be
redeemed by SIGCORP at a price of $01 per right at
58
any time prior to their expiration. If at any time after
the rights become exercisable and are not redeemed and
SIGCORP is involved in a merger or other business
combination transaction, proper provision shall be made to
entitle a holder of a right to buy common stock of the
acquiring company having a value of two times such Purchase
Price. These rights are not exercisable in the merger with
IEI.
SIGECO has a common stock option plan for its key management
employees. The option price for all stock options is at
least 100% of the fair market value of SIGCORP common stock
at the grant date. Options generally vest and become
exercisable between one and three years in equal annual
installments beginning one year after the grant date, and
generally expire in 10 years. The expiration dates for
options outstanding as of December 31, 1999, ranged from
July 13, 2005 to July 14, 2008. Stock option activity for
the past three years was as follows At December 31              1999    1998    1997

The fair value of each option granted used to determine pro
forma net income is estimated as of the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions used for grants in the twelve
month periods ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997: risk-
free interest rate of 646%, 444% and 575%, respectively;
expected option term of five years; expected volatilities of
3400%, 3316% and 3662%, respectively; and dividend rates
of 446%, 377% and 446%, respectively.

Diluted EPS
$52,057 23,724  $219 $50,476 23,765 $212 $46,140 23,687 $195
Basic earnings per common share were computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per common share were determined using the treasury stock
method for dilutive stock options.
Options to purchase 74,999 shares of common stock at $3206
per share were granted in July 1998, but were not included
in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common shares.
CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The amount payable in
the event of involuntary liquidation of each series of the
$100 par value preferred stock is $100 per share, plus
accrued dividends. This nonredeemable preferred stock is
callable at the option of SIGECO as follows: the 48% Series
at $110 per share, plus accrued dividends; and the 475%
Series at $101 per share, plus accrued dividends.
CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The Series
has a dividend rate of 650% and is redeemable at $100 per
share on December 1, 2002. In the event of involuntary
liquidation of this series of $100 par value preferred
stock, the amount payable is $100 per share, plus accrued
dividends.
CUMULATIVE SPECIAL PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO The Cumulative
Special Preferred Stock contains a provision which allows
the stock to be tendered on any of its dividend payment
dates. On January 29, 1999, SIGECO repurchased 1,160 shares
of the Cumulative Special Preferred Stock at a cost of
$117,600 as a result of a tender within the provision of the
issuance.

NOTE 9 SEGMENTS OF BUSINESS
SIGCORP AND SIGECO
SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments in financial statements
and disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise for which separate financial information is
available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in
assessing performance.
SIGCORP has four reportable segments. They are SIGECO
electric and gas utility operations, Energy Services' gas
marketing services and SIPI investment operations. All
other subsidiary operations and corporate activities are
included in other. SIGCORP reportable segments are
operations that are managed separately and meet the
quantitative thresholds required by SFAS No. 131. A
description of the segments' products and services is
included in Note 1 Principles of Consolidation. The
accounting policies of the segments are those described in
Note 1. Revenues for each of SIGCORP segments are
attributable principally to customers in the United States
except a portion of revenues for SIPI which are attributable
to customers in the Netherlands and Belgium as well.

Redeemable Preferred Stock   7,500    7,538    7,500   9,044 At December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, the fair value
of SIGCORP debt relating to utility operations exceeded
carrying amounts by $24,500,000 and $65,000,000.
Anticipated regulatory treatment of the excess or deficiency
of fair value over carrying amounts of SIGECO long-term
debt, if in fact settled at amounts approximating those
above, would dictate that these amounts be used to reduce or
increase SIGECO rates over a prescribed amortization
period. Accordingly, any settlement would not result in a
material impact on SIGECO financial position or results of
operations.
LONG-TERM DEBT At December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively,
the fair value of SIGCORP long-term debt, which was
substantially related to SIGECO operations, were based on
the current quoted market interest rate of long-term debt of
comparably rated utilities 646% and 509%. Fair value
of SIGCORP tax-exempt issues were valued at the tax-
effected rate of such debt 326% and 401 respectively.
REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF SIGECO At December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively, the fair value of SIGECO
redeemable preferred stock were based on the current quoted
market rate of long-term debt with similar characteristics,
of comparably rated utilities 646% and 509%.
PARTNERSHIP OBLIGATIONS At December 31, 1999 and 1998,
respectively, the fair value of SIGCORP partnership
obligations were estimated based on the current quoted
market rate of comparable debt 762% and 509%.
NOTE 11 ENVIRONMENTAL
On November 3, 1999, the USEPA filed a lawsuit against
SIGECO. The USEPA alleges that, beginning in 1992, SIGECO
violated the Clean Air Act by: i making modifications to
its Culley Generating Station in Yankeetown, Indiana without
obtaining required permits; ii making major modifications
to the Culley Generating Station without installing the best
available emission control technology; and iii failing to
notify the USEPA of the modifications. In addition, the
lawsuit alleges that the modifications to the Culley
Generating Station required SIGECO to begin complying with
federal new source performance standards.
SIGECO believes it performed only proper maintenance at the
Culley Generating Station. Because proper maintenance does
not require permits, application of the best available
emission control technology, notice to the USEPA, or
compliance with new source performance standards, SIGECO
believes that the lawsuit is without merit, and intends to
defend the lawsuit vigorously. The lawsuit seeks fines against SIGECO in the amount of
$27,500 per day per violation. The lawsuit does not specify
the number of days or violations the USEPA believes
occurred. The lawsuit also seeks a court order requiring
SIGECO to install the best available emissions technology at
the Culley Generating Station. If the USEPA is successful
in obtaining an order, SIGECO estimates that it would incur
capital costs of approximately $40 million to $50 million
complying with the order.
The USEPA has also issued an administrative notice of
violation to SIGECO making the same allegations, but
alleging that violations began in 1977.
Under applicable rules, SIGECO could be subjected to
criminal penalties if the Culley Generating Station
continues to operate without complying with the new source
performance standards and the allegations are determined by
a court to be valid. SIGECO anticipates at this time that
the plant will continue to operate while the matter is being
decided. SIGECO does not believe that it is liable for the
alleged fine in this matter, but cannot determine the
outcome of the matter with certainty. Currently, no
liability has been recorded for this matter.
NOTE 12 SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On January 28, 2000, affiliates of Blackstone Capital
Partners III, a private equity fund of The Blackstone Group
invested in class B equity units of Utilicom Holdings LLC
Holdings a newly formed holding company. The investment
was the first part of a commitment by Blackstone to invest
up to $100 million to fund future growth opportunities in
fiber optic networks. At the same time, Advanced
Communications exchanged 35 percent of its current 49
percent equity interest in SIGECOM LLC for $165 million of
convertible debt of Holdings. The debt is convertible into
class A equity units at a future date or in the event of a
public offering of stock. Simultaneous with this
transaction, Utilicom was downstreamed to Holdings and the
existing equity interests in Utilicom were converted to
class A equity units in Holdings. The investment
restructuring resulted in an immediate after tax gain to
SIGCORP of $4,900,000 in the first quarter of 2000. 65 Selected Quarterly
