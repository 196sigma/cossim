To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Company as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework and our report dated March26, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Vancouver, Canada s/ERNSTYOUNGLLP March26, 2015 CharteredAccountants 59 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
We have audited OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 Framework the COSO criteria. OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as of December31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2014 and our report dated March26, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
In thousands, except per share and share amounts 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. referred to as OncoGenex, we, us, or our is committed to the development and commercialization of new therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware and are headquartered in Bothell, Washington and have a subsidiary in Vancouver, British Columbia. 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary OncoGenex Technologies, Inc. 
Liquidity 
We have historically experienced recurring losses from operations that have generated an accumulated deficit of $1600 million through December31, 2014. At December31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $471 million. 2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions principally relate to estimates of the fair value of our warrant liability and excess lease facility liability, the initial fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants, the estimated compensation cost on performance restricted stock unit awards and clinical trial and manufacturing accruals. 
Cash Equivalents 
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents, which we consider as available for sale and carry at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders equity. 
Short-Term Investments 
Short-term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year. We consider our short-term investments as available-for-sale and carry them at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses except other than temporary losses, if any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders equity. Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss. The cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities. We determine the fair value of our warrant liability based on the Black-Scholes pricing model and using considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life. Other financial instruments including amounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities other, accrued clinical liabilities, accrued compensation and lease termination liability are carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. 
Intellectual Property 
The costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development process, including licensing fees and milestone payments, are charged to research and development expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an 
65 alternative future use for the acquired rights, and are capitalized in situations where we have identified an alternative future use. No costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized to date. Costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue recognized to date is attributable to the upfront payment we received in the fourth quarter of 2009 pursuant to the collaboration agreement with Teva, as well as cash reimbursements from Teva for costs incurred by us under the clinical development plan. In December 2014, we and Teva entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to negotiate the termination of our collaboration agreement. If the collaboration agreement is terminated, we do not expect to receive any future amounts from Teva beyond the amounts paid in connection with such termination.
Under the collaboration agreement, we and Teva shared certain custirsen-related development costs. We have spent the required $30 million in direct and indirect development costs, such as full-time equivalent FTE reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the custirsen development plan. Teva is funding all other expenses under the collaboration agreement including the three phase 3 clinical trials under the clinical development plan. If the collaboration agreement is terminated, we expect to take responsibility for all future development costs. On a quarterly basis Teva reimbursed all development expenses incurred in accordance with our clinical development plan. Our policy is to account for these reimbursements as Collaboration Revenue. For a summary description of the collaboration agreement with Teva see also Note 4. 
The collaboration agreement contained multiple elements and deliverables, and required evaluation pursuant to ASC 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. We evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether we had obligations constituting deliverables under ASC 605-25. We concluded that we had multiple deliverables under the collaboration agreement, including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license, and performance of manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development services in the U.S. and Canada, and estimated that the period in which it would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of 2009 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Because we have been able to establish vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the maintenance, regulatory, and clinical services, we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under ASC 605-25. In establishing VSOE for the manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical development services, management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services. 
As of December31, 2012 we had recognized the entire $30 million allocated to the manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue on a proportional performance basis. 
Because we were not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license, we used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize. Based on this approach, we recognized $22 million in 2009 relating to this element. 
Under the collaboration agreement, we are entitled to receive up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones. We evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive milestones. This conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables, and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to it. We concluded that each of these milestones was substantive, based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non-refundable, that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement, that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone, that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone, that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments, and that the milestone payments, once received, relate solely to past performance. Based on the foregoing, we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs.
Under the collaboration agreement, we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of custirsen ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties. We will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Based on those criteria, we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue, and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved.
Barter Transactions 
During 2012, we entered into a barter transaction, exchanging laboratory capital assets with a zero net book value for barter credits on future apatorsen preclinical research services. Such credits were estimated to be redeemed over the one year period that the preclinical research services were expected to be rendered by the vendor. 
66 The credits were recorded at the fair value of the laboratory capital assets exchanged, in accordance with ASC 845, Nonmonetary Transactions resulting in other income of $02 million which was recorded in the Companys Consolidated Statement of Loss in the year ended December31, 2012.
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense on assets acquired under capital lease is recorded within depreciation expense. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the following periods: Computer equipment 3 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years Leasehold improvements and equipment under capital lease Overthetermofthelease Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws. 
Scientific Research and Development Tax Credits 
The benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided there is reasonable assurance of recoverability. The tax credits recorded are based on our estimates of amounts expected to be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities. The non-refundable tax credit reduces the tax provision; however, no reduction to the tax provision has been recorded to date as we record a full valuation allowance. All qualifying expenditures are eligible for non-refundable tax credits only. 
Research and Development Costs 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, net of related refundable investment tax credits, with the exception of non-refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development, which are capitalized in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development and included within Prepaid Expenses or Other Assets depending on when the assets will be utilized. 
Clinical trial expenses are a component of research and development costs. These expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers, which conduct certain product development activities on our behalf. We use an accrual basis of accounting, based upon estimates of the amount of service completed. In the event payments differ from the amount of service completed, prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance sheet. These expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements, milestones achieved, patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts. We monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the ASC 718, Stock Compensation, using the modified prospective method with respect to options granted to employees and directors. Under this transition method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date for all share-based payments granted after January1, 2006 and for all awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of January1, 2006. The expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the graded vesting period. 
Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
We grant restricted stock unit awards that generally vest and are expensed over a four-year period. We also granted restricted stock unit awards that vest in conjunction with certain performance conditions to certain executive officers and key employees. At each reporting date, we evaluate whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable. Compensation expense is recorded over the appropriate service period based upon our assessment of accomplishing each performance provision or the occurrence of other events that may have caused the awards to accelerate and vest.
67 Segment Information 
We follow the requirements of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We have one operating segment, dedicated to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies, with operations located in Canada and the United States. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities. We report the components of comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity. 
Loss per Common Share 
Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method. The effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding stock options, restricted stock unit awards and warrants are anti-dilutive for all periods presented. 
Warrants 
We account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a companys own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and therefore do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement. We classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of shares of our common stock for a period that coincides with the expected life of the warrants. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrants. Changes in the fair value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on revaluation of warrants. 
Reclassifications 
Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with the financial presentation adopted for the current year. Accrued liabilities other and accrued clinical liabilities were reclassified and shown separately on the face of the consolidated balance sheet rather than combined together as accrued liabilities, as in the prior year. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
Our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Revenues and expenses denominated in other than U.S. dollars are translated at average monthly rates. 
The functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is the U.S. dollar. For this foreign operation, assets and liabilities denominated in other than U.S. dollars are translated at the period-end rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Revenues and expenses denominated in other than U.S. dollars are translated at average monthly rates. Gains and losses from this translation are recognized in the consolidated statement of loss. 
Pending Adoption of Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated, or ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern Subtopic 2015-40 ASU 2014-15. ASU 2014-15 provides guidance to U.S. GAAP about managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This new rule requires management to assess an entitys ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles currently in the U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, ASU 2014-15 1 defines the term substantial doubt, 2 requires and evaluation of every reporting period including interim periods, 3 provides principles for considering the mitigating effect of managements plans, 5 requires an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and 6 requires an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. This guidance is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 
68 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 and do not expect any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which guidance in this update will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance when it becomes effective. ASU No. 2014-09 affects any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. The core principal of ASU No. 2014-09 is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, which will be our fiscal year 2017 or December 31, 2017, and entities can transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
Recently Adopted Accounting Policies 
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes Topic 740: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force ASU 2013-11, which provides clarification on the financial statement presentation of unrecognized tax benefits. ASU 2013-11 specifies that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion thereof shall be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. If such deferred tax asset is not available at the reporting date to settle additional income taxes resulting from the disallowance of a tax position, or the entity does not plan to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose given the option, the unrecognized tax benefit shall be presented in the financial statements as a liability and shall not be combined with deferred tax assets. The amendments in ASU 2013-11 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.
In February 2013, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updates, or ASU, No. 2013-02, Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. 3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK 
For certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities other, accrued clinical liabilities, accrued compensation and lease termination liability carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are recorded at fair value. 
Financial risk is the risk to our results of operations that arises from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates as well as credit risk associated with the financial stability of the issuers of the financial instruments. Foreign exchange rate risk arises as a portion of our investments which finance operations and a portion of our expenses are denominated in other than U.S. dollars. 
We invest our excess cash in accordance with investment guidelines, which limit our credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporation other than securities issued by the U.S. government. We only invest in A or equivalent rated securities with maturities of one year or less. These securities generally mature within one year or less and in some cases are not collateralized. At December31, 2014 the average days to maturity of our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities was 174 days December 31, 2013 50 days. We do not use derivative instruments to hedge against any of these financial risks. 4. COLLABORATION AGREEMENT 
In December 2009, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies, entered into a collaboration agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related 
69 compounds, a pharmaceutical compound designed to inhibit the production of clusterin, a protein we believe is associated with cancer treatment resistance, or the Licensed Product. In December 2014, we and Teva entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to cooperate in good faith to negotiate and execute a final termination agreement providing, among other things, for the termination of our collaboration agreement. These negotiations are ongoing, and we cannot provide assurance regarding if or when the collaboration agreement will be terminated, or regarding the full terms under which control of the development of custirsen, including ongoing clinical trials, will be transferred to us. If the collaboration agreement is terminated, we do not expect to receive any future amounts from Teva beyond the amounts paid in connection with such termination and we expect to take responsibility for all future development costs.
Under the collaboration agreement, Teva paid us upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50 million, acquired $10 million of our common stock at a premium under a separate Stock Purchase Agreement and agreed to pay up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales, depending on aggregate annual net sales of the Licensed Product. We did not receive any payments from Teva resulting from the achievement of developmental or commercial milestones or royalties in 2014.
Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Tevas $10 million equity investment in OncoGenex was made at a 20% premium to a thirty-day average closing price, resulting in the issuance of 267,531 of our common shares purchased at a price of $3738 per share. The 20% share premium was included as consideration for the custirsen license and was included in Collaboration Revenue.
In connection with the collaboration agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between us and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Isis, relating to custirsen, we paid Isis $10 million which was recorded as research and development expense in 2009. We also paid approximately $03 million to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, pursuant to the terms of their license agreement relating to custirsen, which was recorded as research and development expense in 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, we anticipate that we would be required to pay third parties 21% of any milestone payments that are not based on a percentage of net sales of the Licensed Product. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, we anticipate we will pay royalties to third-parties of 488% to 800% of net sales, unless our royalties are adjusted for competition from generic compounds, in which case royalties to third parties will also be subject to adjustment on a country-by-country basis. Certain third-party royalties are tiered based on the royalty rate received by us. Minimum royalty rates payable by us assume certain third-party royalties are not paid at the time that the Licensed Product is marketed due to the expiration of patents held by such third parties. Maximum royalty rates assume all third-party royalty rates currently in effect continue in effect at the time the Licensed Product is marketed. We did not make any royalty payments to Isis in 2014. Teva has the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds. We have an option to co-promote any Licensed Product in the United States and Canada.
Under the collaboration agreement, unless otherwise terminated, Teva is responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to our co-promotion option, except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization.
In March 2012, OncoGenex Technologies and Teva entered into an amendment to the collaboration agreement. Under this amendment, OncoGenex Technologies and Teva revised the clinical development plan, under which the following three phase 3 clinical trials have been initiated The SYNERGY Trial: The phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first-line docetaxel treatment in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. The AFFINITY Trial: The phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel treatment as second-line chemotherapy in patients with CRPC. The ENSPIRIT Trial: The phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel treatment as second-line chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC.
Teva will be responsible for conducting any other studies and development work necessary to obtain required regulatory approvals. We may assume some of these activities if assigned by the joint steering committee. Teva will be responsible for all such costs. The joint steering committee will oversee the development and regulatory approval of any Licensed Product. We may terminate our participation in the joint steering committee at any time.
We have fulfilled our obligation of funding $30 million towards the development of custirsen as of December 31, 2013, which included our personnel costs for certain development activities. Teva is funding all other expenses under the collaboration agreement including the three phase 3 clinical trials under the clinical development plan.
The collaboration agreement with Teva will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the obligation of Teva to pay royalties on sales of the Licensed Product in such country or earlier termination under its terms. After the completion of all three phase 3 clinical trials set forth in the clinical development plan, or upon early termination due 
70 to a material adverse change in our patent rights related to custirsen or safety issues or futility as defined in the collaboration agreement, Teva may terminate the collaboration agreement at its sole discretion upon three months notice if notice is given prior to regulatory approval of a Licensed Product and upon six months notice if notice is given after such regulatory approval. If Teva terminates the collaboration agreement for any reasons other than an adverse change in custirsen patent rights, safety issues or futility determination as previously described, it will remain responsible for paying for any remaining costs of all three phase 3 clinical trials, except for specified development expenses that are our responsibility.
Either party may terminate the collaboration agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party, unless such breach is not curable, in which case the agreement may not be terminated unless the other party fails to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent a similar subsequent breach. Either party also may terminate the collaboration agreement upon the bankruptcy of either party. If the collaboration agreement is terminated by us for other than an uncured material breach by Teva, we will pay Teva a royalty on sales of Licensed Products. The percentage rates of such royalties which are in the single digits vary depending on whether termination occurs prior to the first regulatory approval in the United States or a primary European Market or after one of these approvals. These royalties would expire on a country-by-country basis on the earlier of ten years after the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product or certain thresholds related to generic competition.
In the event of a change of control of OncoGenex, within 90 days of the change of control, Teva may terminate the joint steering committee at its sole discretion, terminate the co-promotion option at its sole discretion if the option has not been exercised by us or, if exercised, but not yet executed by us, or terminate the co-promotion option if in its commercially reasonable opinion co-promotion with our successor would be materially detrimental to Tevas interests.
Revenue from Teva for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $271 million, $299 million and $201 million, respectively. All of the December31, 2014 amount receivable balance of $57 million represents unbilled expense reimbursements from Teva, for which we bill quarterly in arrears. Consequently, we are exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. Revenue earned in 2014 and 2013 consists of reimbursable clinical trial, manufacturing and preclinical costs incurred by us under the Amended Clinical Development Plan. Revenue earned in 2012 consisted primarily of the recognition of the remaining balance of Deferred Collaboration Revenue as well as reimbursable clinical trial, manufacturing and preclinical costs incurred by us. 
Amendment to Isis and UBC License Agreements 
To facilitate the execution and performance of the collaboration agreement with Teva, we amended our license agreements with Isis and UBC, as it pertains to custirsen, in December 2009.
The amendment to the license agreement with Isis provides, among other things, that if we are the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then i a milestone payment of $20 million will be due and payable to Isis 21 days following the first commercial sale of the product in the United States; and ii unless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by us has been established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the license agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the $20 million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10 million milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the collaboration agreement with Teva, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10 million. As we have now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if Teva acquires us and is the surviving company. The $30 million in advanced reimbursement of development activities has been fully spent by us prior to the third anniversary of the collaboration agreement with Teva. As a result, we do not owe any payment to Isis related to the $30 million advance reimbursement from Teva. 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. For certain of our financial instruments including amounts receivable and accounts payable the carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820, these inputs are summarized in the three broad level listed below: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 Other significant inputs that are observable through corroboration with market data including quoted prices in active markets for similar securities. 
71 Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 
As quoted prices in active markets are not readily available for certain financial instruments, we obtain estimates for the fair value of financial instruments through third-party pricing service providers. 
In determining the appropriate levels, we performed a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820. 
We invest our excess cash in accordance with investment guidelines that limit the credit exposure to any one financial institution other than securities issued by the U.S. Government. These securities are not collateralized and mature within one year. 
A description of the valuation techniques applied to our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows. 
Financial Instruments 
Cash 
Significant amounts of cash are held on deposit with large well established U.S. and Canadian financial institutions. 
U.S. Government and Agency Securities 
U.S. Government Securities U.S. government securities are valued using quoted market prices. Valuation adjustments are not applied. Accordingly, U.S. government securities are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
U.S. Agency Securities U.S. agency securities are comprised of two main categories consisting of callable and non-callable agency issued debt securities. Non-callable agency issued debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices. Callable agency issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. Actively traded non-callable agency issued debt securities are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Callable agency issued debt securities are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
Corporate and Other Debt 
Corporate Bonds and Commercial Paper The fair value of corporate bonds and commercial paper is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations where observable, bond spreads or credit default swap spreads adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments. The spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that reference a comparable issuer are used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as significant inputs. Corporate bonds and commercial paper are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; in instances where prices, spreads or any of the other aforementioned key inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in Level 3 of the hierarchy. 
Warrants 
As of December31, 2014, we recorded a $30 million warrant liability. We reassess the fair value of the common stock warrants classified as liabilities at each reporting date utilizing a Black-Scholes pricing model. Inputs used in the pricing model include estimates of stock price volatility, expected warrant life and risk-free interest rate. The computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of shares of our common stock for a period that coincides with the expected life of the warrants that are classified as liabilities. Warrants that are classified as liabilities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. Warrants that are classified as equity are not considered liabilities and therefore are not reassessed for their fair values at each reporting date. 
The following table presents the changes in fair value of our total Level 3 financial liabilities for the year ended December31, 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 we issued 35 million common stock warrants that were classified as liabilities in thousands: Liability at Unrealized Liability at December 31 Issuance of Gain on December 31 2013 Warrants warrants 2014 Warrant liability 214 6,529 3,741 3,002 72 The following table presents information about our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value in thousands: December31, 2014 Level1 Level2 Level3 Total Assets Cash 16,481 16,481 Money market securities 11,416 11,416 Restricted cash Note 15 251 251 Corporate bonds and commercial paper 19,160 19,160 Total assets 28,148 19,160 47,308 Liabilities Warrants 3,002 3,002 December31, 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets Cash 10,575 10,575 Money market securities 4,018 4,018 Restricted Cash 314 314 Corporate bonds and commercial paper 24,629 24,629 Total assets 14,907 24,629 39,536 Liabilities Warrants 214 214 Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands: Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated December31, 2014 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Cash 16,481 16,481 Money market securities 11,416 11,416 Total cash and cash equivalents 27,897 27,897 Money market securities restricted cash 251 251 Total restricted cash 251 251 Corporate bonds and commercial paper 19,179 1 20 19,160 Total short-term investments 19,179 1 20 19,160 Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Estimated December31, 2013 Cost Gains Losses Fair Value Cash 10,575 10,575 Money market securities 4,018 4,018 Total cash and cash equivalents 14,593 14,593 Money market securities restricted cash 314 314 Total restricted cash 314 314 Corporate bonds and commercial paper 24,627 3 1 24,629 Total short-term investments 24,627 3 1 24,629 Our gross realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended December31, 2014 and 2013. 
All securities included in cash and cash equivalents have maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. All securities included in short-term investments have maturities of within one year of the balance sheet date. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
We only invest in A or equivalent rated securities with maturities of one year or less. We do not believe that there are any other than temporary impairments related to our investment in marketable securities at December31, 2014, given the quality of the investment portfolio, its short-term nature, and subsequent proceeds collected on sale of securities that reached maturity. 73 6. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

EXCESS LEASE LIABILITY 
On August21, 2008, Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Sonus, completed a transaction the Arrangement with OncoGenex Technologies Inc., or OncoGenex Technologies, whereby Sonus acquired all of the outstanding preferred shares, common shares and convertible debentures of OncoGenex Technologies. Sonus then changed its name to OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Prior to the Arrangement, Sonus entered into a non-cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in Bothell, Washington, which is considered to be in excess of our current requirements. The liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-20, Business Combinations -Identifiable Assets and Liabilities, and Any Noncontrolling Interest. In February 2015, we entered into a Lease Termination Agreement with the landlord for the office space in Bothell such that the lease terminates effective March 1, 2015. Under the Lease Termination Agreement, we will pay BMR-217TH Place LLC BMR a $20 million termination fee no later than the Termination Date. We will also pay BMR an additional termination fee of $13 million within 30 days after we i meet the primary endpoint for our phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of second line metastatic CRPC with custirsen and ii close a transaction or transactions pursuant to which we receive funding in an aggregate amount of at least $200 million. As a result of the Lease Termination Agreement, we have recorded the lease termination fees and have made an adjustment to the lease liability to reflect the change in estimated liability. This represents our best estimate of the liability, see also Note 15.  Liability at Amortization Reduction Liability at December 31 of excess of December 31 In thousands 2013 lease facility Liability 2014 Current portion of excess lease facility 1,081 33 920 194 Long-term portion of excess lease facility 2,825 818 2,007 Total 3,906 785 2,927 194 8. OTHER ASSETS 
Other assets include prepaid amounts related to clinical trials that will not be utilized in the next 12 months and deposits paid for office space in accordance with the terms of the operating lease agreements. 9. BARTER TRANSACTION 
During 2012, we entered into a barter transaction, exchanging laboratory capital assets with a zero net book value for barter credits on future apatorsen preclinical research services. The credits were recorded at the fair value of the laboratory capital assets exchanged, in accordance with ASC 845, Nonmonetary Transactions resulting in other income of $02 million, which was recorded in our Consolidated Statement of Loss, in 2012. As of December31, 2013 all the barter credits had been utilized in exchange for preclinical research services related to apatorsen. 74 10. INCOME TAX 
[a] The reconciliation of income tax attributable to operations computed at the statutory tax rate to income tax expense is as follows. OncoGenex Technologies, a Canadian corporation, which is subject to combined Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates for December31, 2014, 2013, and 2012 of 260%, 2575%, and 250%, respectively. Following the reverse takeover by OncoGenex Technologies of Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which subsequently changed its name to OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2008, OncoGenex Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, which is a Delaware incorporated company subject to US Federal Statutory rates of 34% for all three years presented. 
For the purposes of estimating the tax rate in effect at the time that deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse, we used the furthest out available future tax rate in the applicable jurisdictions. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 the future Canadian enacted rates we used were 26%, 26%, and 25%, respectively, while for the US the future enacted rate we used was 34% for all three periods presented. In thousands 2014 2013 2012 Income taxes at statutory rates at a rate of 34% for all
periods presented 8,922 10,829 7,152 Expenses not deducted for tax purposes 452 738 1,212 Effect of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities 9 744 Rate differential on foreign earnings 1,445 2,003 1,672 Reduction increase in benefit of operating losses 441 10 15 Reduction in the benefit of other tax attributes 551 Investment tax credits 357 347 485 Change in valuation allowance 7,854 10,538 6,324 Book to tax return adjustments 127 287 Other Income tax expense b] At December31, 2014, we have investment tax credits of $24 million 2013$22 million available to reduce future Canadian income taxes otherwise payable. We also have non-capital loss carryforwards of $963 million 2013$809 million available to offset future taxable income in Canada and federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1511 million 2013$1502 million to offset future taxable income in the United States. 
Under Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and development tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire. A 382 limitation study has been undertaken but the study is not complete. The final results of this study could indicate that the U.S. losses may be materially limited; however, the amount of such limitation cannot be reasonably quantified at this time, but may be significant. In each period since our inception, we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset, as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. 
As a result, we have not recognized any federal or state income tax benefit in our statement of operations. The initial public offering of common stock by us in 1995 caused an ownership change pursuant to applicable regulations in effect under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Therefore, our use of losses incurred through the date of ownership change will be limited during the carryforward period and may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards in the United States before utilization. 
75 The investment tax credits and non-capital losses and net operating losses for income tax purposes expire as follows in thousands: Investment NetOperating Non-capital TaxCredits Losses Losses 2012 44 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 150 10,795 2019 102 32 2020 76 2,745 2021 69 400 2022 105 11,766 2023 96 10,785 2024 111 16,814 2025 144 2,062 2026 400 27,157 7,335 2027 173 22,225 4,949 2028 390 12,648 8,020 2029 317 4,358 9 2030 346 5,034 6,288 2031 608 6,200 12,121 2032 505 8,418 17,278 2033 422 2,520 23,240 2034 434 7,109 17,085 4,448 151,112 96,307 In addition, we have unclaimed tax deductions of approximately $148 million related to scientific research and experimental development expenditures available to carry forward indefinitely to reduce Canadian taxable income of future years. We also have research and development tax credits of $20 million available to reduce future taxes payable in the United States. The research and development tax credits expire between 2015 and 2034. 
[c] Significant components of our deferred tax assets as of December31 are shown below in thousands: 2014 2013 Deferred tax assets Tax basis in excess of book value of assets 4,871 951 Non-capital loss carryforwards 76,403 72,115 Research and development deductions and credits 7,464 6,857 Stock options 3,163 2,578 Capital loss carryforward Restructuring liability 25 1,567 Other 110 70 Total deferred tax assets 91,986 84,138 Valuation allowance 91,986 84,138 The potential income tax benefits relating to these deferred tax assets have not been recognized in the accounts as their realization did not meet the requirements of more likely than not under the liability method of tax allocation. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded and no deferred tax assets have been recognized as at December31, 2014 and 2013. 
[d] Under ASC 740, the benefit of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of the benefit of an uncertain tax position may be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. 
76 A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits of uncertain tax positions for the year ended December31, 2014 is as follows in thousands: Year ended December31 2014 2013 Balance at January1 2,007 1,967 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 32 32 Additions based on tax positions related to prior years 8 Deductions based on tax positions related to the current year Balance at December31 2,039 2,007 As of December31, 2014, unrecognized benefits of approximately $20 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, and would reduce our deferred tax assets. 
Our accounting policy is to treat interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes. As of December31, 2014 and December31, 2013 we had no accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes. 
We are subject to taxes in Canada and the U.S. until the applicable statute of limitations expires. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. Tax Years open to Jurisdiction examination Canada 2007 to 2014 US 2011 to 2014 11. COMMON STOCK

[b] Issued and outstanding shares 
October 2010 Public Offering 
On October22, 2010, we completed a public offering of 3,174,602 units, with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one-half 1/2of one warrant, at a purchase price of $1575 per unit for an aggregate offering amount of $50 million. 
Each whole warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance at an exercise price of $20, and includes a cashless exercise feature. We account for warrants issued in October 2010 under the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a companys own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement. We classify warrants on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrants. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment. On the date of issuance, the Black-Scholes value of the warrant was based on an assumed risk-free rate of 117%, volatility of 75% and an expected life of 5 years. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on warrants. 
The net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, from the sale of the units were $467 million, of which $323 million was allocated to common shares and included in additional paid-in capital and $154 million was allocated to warrant liability. $1 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses allocated to the value of warrants was expensed in warrant issuance expense on our consolidated statement of loss. 
77 March 2012 Public Offering 
On March21, 2012, we completed a public offering of 4,165,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $1200 per share. Pursuant to an overallotment option exercised on March27, 2012 by the underwriters in the offering, an additional offering of 624,750 shares of our common stock were issued at a price of $1200 per share. The total gross offering amount from the public offering and exercise of the overallotment option was approximately $575 million. The total net proceeds to us from the public offering and exercise of the overallotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses from the sale of the shares were approximately $538 million. 
At-The-Market Issuance Sales Agreement 
In June 2013, we entered into an At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement, or Sales Agreement, with MLV Co. LLC, or MLV, under which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having aggregate sales proceeds of up to $25 million from time to time through MLV as our sales agent. Sales of our common stock through MLV, if any, will be made by any method permitted that is deemed an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including by means of ordinary brokers transactions on The NASDAQ Capital Market or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by us and MLV. MLV will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time, based upon instructions from us including any price, time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose. We will pay MLV a commission of up to 30% of the gross sales proceeds of any shares of common stock sold through MLV under the Sales Agreement. We are not obligated to make any sales of common stock under the Sales Agreement. The offering of our shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of ithe sale of all common stock subject to the Sales Agreement or iitermination of the Sales Agreement in accordance with its terms.
As of December 31, 2014, we have offered and sold 809,214 shares of our common stock pursuant to our At-the-Market Issuance Sales Agreement with MLV Co. LLC. These sales resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $30 million and offering expenses of $01 million. As of September30, 2014, shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of approximately $220 million remained available for sale under this offering program. 
July 2014 Registered Offering 
On July2, 2014, we completed an underwritten registered offering pursuant to which we sold 5,559,866 Series A units at a price per unit of $348 and 1,340,538 Series B units at a price per unit of $347. 
Each Series A unit consisted of one share of common stock and a Series A warrant to purchase up to one-half of one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $400 per share. Each Series A warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the Series A warrants. 
Each Series B unit consisted of a Pre-Funded Series B warrant to purchase up to one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $001 per share and a Series B warrant to purchase up to one-half of one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $400 per share. Each Pre-Funded Series B warrant and Series B warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the Pre-Funded Series B warrants and Series B warrants, respectively. 
We received net proceeds of approximately $224 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Gross proceeds of $240 million and underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $16 million were allocated as follows: Series B Pre-funded Series A Series B Common Common Common Common Stock Stock Stock Stock Warrants Warrants Warrants Units Issued 5,559,866 1,340,538 2,779,933 670,269 Gross Proceeds in thousands 14,084 3,387 5,261 1,268 Underwriting discount and offering expense in thousands 885 213 428 103 The Series A and Series B common stock warrants are classified as liabilities. The underwriting discount and offering expenses allocated to the Series A and Series B common stock warrants have been expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Loss. 
The common stock and Series B prefunded common stock warrants are classified as equity. The underwriting discount and offering expenses allocated to the common stock and Series B prefunded common stock warrants have been charged against the allocated gross proceeds. 
78 Stock Option Exercises 
During the year ended December31, 2014, we issued 10,000 and 203,148 shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and restricted stock unit settlements, respectively, compared with the issuance of 3,475 and 47,495 shares of common to satisfy stock option exercises and restricted stock unit settlements, respectively, for the years ended December31, 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2012 we issued 117,347 shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises. There were no restricted stock unit settlements in 2012. 
[c] Stock options 
As at December31, 2014 we had reserved, pursuant to our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan, 2,906,777 common shares for issuance upon exercise of stock options and settlement of restricted stock units by employees, directors, officers and consultants of ours, of which 1,283,419 are reserved for options currently outstanding, 680,201 are reserved for restricted stock units currently outstanding and 943,157 are available for future equity award grants under our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. As of December31, 2013 1,016,553 shares were available for equity award grants under our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. 
2010 Performance Incentive Plan 
At our 2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May26, 2011, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of this amendment, the 2010 Plan was amended to provide for an increase in the total shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2010 Plan from 450,000 to 1,050,000. At our 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May24, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of this amendment, the 2010 Plan was further amended to provide for an increase in the total shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2010 Plan from 1,050,000 to 2,050,000. 
Under the plan, we may grant options to purchase common shares or restricted stock units to our employees, directors, officers and consultants. The exercise price of the options is determined by our board of directors but will be at least equal to the fair value of the common shares at the grant date. The options vest in accordance with terms as determined by our board of directors, typically over three to four years for options issued to employees and consultants, and over one to three years for members of our board of directors. The expiry date for each option is set by our board of directors with a maximum expiry date of ten years from the date of grant. 
Options remain outstanding under a number of share option plans that had been approved by shareholders prior to the approval of the 2010 Performance Incentive Plan: athe Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan 1991 1991 Plan, bthe 1999 Nonqualified Stock Incentive Plan 1999 Plan, cthe 2000 Stock Incentive Plan 2000 Plan, dthe 2007 Performance Incentive Plan 2007 Plan and ethe OncoGenex Technologies Inc. Stock Option Plan OncoGenex Technologies Plan. 
ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation 
We recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using the provisions of ASC 718. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our stock options and recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. In valuing our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, we make assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility and weighted average expected lives, including estimated forfeiture rates of the options. 
The expected life was calculated based on the simplified method as permitted by the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin 110, Share-Based Payment. We consider the use of the simplified method appropriate because we believe our historical stock option exercise activity may not be indicative of future stock option exercise activity because of the AFFINITY clinical data results we expect to receive by late 2015 or early 2016, the structural changes to our business that may result and the potential impact of that data on our business operations and future stock option exercise activity. The expected volatility of options granted was calculated based on the historical volatility of the shares of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. In addition to the assumptions above, as required under ASC 718, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated using historical actual forfeiture rates. These rates are adjusted on a quarterly basis and any change in compensation expense is recognized in the period of the change. We have never paid or declared cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 
79 The estimated fair value of stock options granted in the respective periods was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions: 2014 2013 2012 Risk-free interest rates 183 125 096 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected life 59years 58years 59years Expected volatility 82 86 95 The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $652, $807 and $986 per share, respectively. 
The results for the periods set forth below included stock-based compensation expense in the following expense categories of the consolidated statements of loss in thousands: Years ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Research and development 1,893 1,296 899 General and administrative 1,967 1,538 1,276 Total stock-based compensation 3,860 2,834 2,175 Options vest in accordance with terms as determined by our board of directors, typically over three or four years for employee and consultant grants and over one or three years for board of director option grants. The expiry date for each option is set by our board of directors with, which is typically seven to ten years. The exercise price of the options is determined by our board of directors but is at least equal to the fair value of the share at the grant date.

The estimated grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $19 million, $18 million and $16 million, respectively. 
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the date of exercise. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $51,100, $34,000 and $12 million, respectively. At December31, 2014, the aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding options was $4,680 and the aggregate intrinsic value of the exercisable options was zero. 
81 d] Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
We grant restricted stock unit awards that generally vest and are expensed over a four year period. We also grant restricted stock unit awards that vest in conjunction with certain performance conditions to certain executive officers and key employees. At each reporting date, we are required to evaluate whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable. Compensation expense is recorded over the appropriate service period based upon our assessment of accomplishing each performance provision. For the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2011, $22 million, $11 million and $06 million, respectively, of stock based compensation expense was recognized related to these awards. 
The following table summarizes our restricted stock unit award activity during the years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Weighted Number Average of Grant Date Shares Fair Value Balance, January1, 2012 Granted 180,085 1301 Vested Forfeited or expired 8,000 1300 Balance, December31, 2012 172,085 1301 Granted 255,895 1164 Vested 50,773 1295 Forfeited or expired 20,618 1251 Balance, December31, 2013 356,589 1206 Granted 814,800 648 Vested 199,887 700 Forfeited or expired 291,301 1093 Balance, December31, 2014 680,201 734 As of December31, 2014, we had approximately $35 million in total unrecognized compensation expense related to our restricted stock unit awards which is to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 28 years. 
[e] Stock Warrants 
The following is a summary of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock at December 31, 2014: Total Outstanding Exercise and price per Exercisable Share Expiration Date 1 Warrants issued in October 2010 financing 1,587,301 2000 October 2015 2 Series A Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 2,779,933 400 July 2019 3 Series B Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 670,269 400 July 2019 4 Pre-Funded Series B Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 001 July 2019 For the year ended December 31, 2014, all the Pre-Funded Series B warrants were exercised at a per unit price of $001, a total of 1,340,538 shares of common stock were issued for proceeds of $13,405. No warrants from the October 2010 financing and Series A and Series B warrants from the July 2014 financing were exercised in 2014. No warrants were exercised for the year ended December 31, 2013.
82 The warrants issued in the October 2010 financing and the Series A and Series B warrants issued in the July 2014 financing are classified as liabilities. The estimated fair value of warrants issued and classified as liabilities is reassessed at each reporting date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Pre-Funded Series B warrants are classified as equity and are not reassessed for their fair value at the end of each reporting date. The following assumptions were used to value the warrants that are classified as liabilities on the following reporting dates: As of December 31 October 2010 Warrant Valuation Assumptions 2014 2013 Risk-free interest rates 025 033 Expected dividend yield 0 0 Expected life 081 years 18 years Expected volatility 11349 3900 As of December 31 Series A and Series B Warrant Valuation Assumptions 2014 2013 Risk-free interest rates 151 Expected dividend yield 0 Expected life 450 years Expected volatility 6291 f] Shareholder Rights Plan 
We have a Shareholder Rights Plan which was adopted in July 1996 and subsequently amended in July 2002,October 2005,August 2006, and May 2008 the Rights Plan. Under the Plan our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right Right for each outstanding common share of OncoGenex. Subject to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $140, subject to adjustment. These Rights provide the holders with the right to purchase, in the event a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock, additional shares of our common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the one-for-eighteen reverse stock split caused a proportionate adjustment of the number of Rights associated with each share of common stock. Currently, eighteen Rights are associated with each share of common stock. 
[g] 401k Plan 
We maintain a 401k plan. Following the Arrangement, the Board of Directors of OncoGenex amended and restated the 401k plan whereas our securities are no longer offered as an investment option. This amendment prohibits the inclusion of our shares in the 401k plan, as well as any match of our shares to employee contributions.

The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per share in thousands, except per share and share amounts: Years ended December31 2014 2013 2012 Numerator Net loss 26,240 31,849 21,098 Denominator Weighted average number of common shares outstanding 18,098,799 14,683,389 13,522,723 Basic and diluted net loss per common share 145 217 156 As of December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 a total of 70million, 30million and 26million options, restricted stock units and warrants, respectively, have not been included in the calculation of potential common shares as their effect on diluted per share amounts would have been anti-dilutive. 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
There were no related party transactions during the periods ended December31, 2014, 2013 or 2012, and no amounts were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as at December31, 2014 and 2013. 
83 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. 
In December 2009, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies, entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds. In December 2014, we and Teva entered into an agreement pursuant to which we agreed to cooperate in good faith to negotiate and execute a final termination agreement providing, among other things, for the termination of the the collaboration agreement. These negotiations are ongoing, and we cannot provide assurance regarding if or when the collaboration agreement will be terminated, or regarding the full terms under which control of the development of custirsen, including ongoing clinical trials, will be transferred to us. If the collaboration agreement is terminated, we do not expect to receive any future amounts from Teva beyond the amounts paid in connection with such termination and we expect to take responsibility for all future development costs.
Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva made upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50 million, and will make additional payments up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales. Teva also acquired $10 million of our common stock at a premium under a separate Stock Purchase Agreement. We have fulfilled our obligation to contribute $30 million in direct and indirect costs towards the development of custirsen. Accordingly, Teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan. The expenses funded by Teva during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 represent all of our revenues in such periods.
Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to collaborate with Teva in the development and global commercialization of custirsen. Teva received the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds, or the Licensed Products. We have an option to co-promote custirsen in the United States and Canada. In March 2014, we exercised our option to enter into negotiations with Teva for a co-promotion agreement for any Licensed Product under the Collaboration Agreement in the United States and Canada. 
In addition to the development costs noted above, Teva is also responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to our co-promotion option, except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization
Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and University of British Columbia 
We are obligated to pay milestone payments of up to CAD $16 million and $775 million pursuant to license agreements with the UBC and Isis, respectively, upon the achievement of specified product development milestones related to apatorsen and OGX-225 and low to mid-single digit royalties on future product sales. 
In addition, we are required to pay to Isis 20% of all non-royalty revenue defined to mean revenue not based on net sales of products we receive related to custirsen. Isis has disclosed in its SEC filings that it is entitled to receive 30% of the up to $370 million in milestone payments we may receive from Teva as part of the collaboration agreement; however, we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as royalty revenue defined to mean revenue based on net sales of products, and therefore be subject to lesser royalty payment obligations. No assurance can be provided that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or, if we are, that the applicable amount payable to Isis will be less than 30%. We are also obligated to pay to UBC certain patent costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of CAD $8,000 per year. We paid Isis and UBC USD $08 million and CAD $01 million, respectively, in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase 2 clinical trial of apatorsen in patients with CRPC. We did not make any royalty payments to Isis under the terms of the agreement in 2013 or of 2014. The UBC agreements have effective dates ranging from November1, 2001 to April5, 2005 and each agreement expires upon the later of 20 years from its effective date or the expiry of the last patent licensed thereunder, unless otherwise terminated.
Unless otherwise terminated, the Isis agreements for custirsen and apatorsen will continue for each product until the later of 10 years after the date of the first commercial product sale, or the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the product, unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons either custirsen or apatorsen and Isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development. The Isis agreement for OGX-225 will continue into perpetuity unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons the product and Isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development. 
To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, we amended the license agreement with Isis and UBC, as it pertains to custirsen, in December 2009.
The amendment to the license agreement with Isis provides, among other things, that if we are subject to change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then ia milestone payment of $20 million will be due and payable to Isis 21 days following the first commercial sale of the product in the United States; and iiunless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by us has been established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the license 
84 agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the $20 million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10 million milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10 million. Because we have now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if Teva were to acquire us and become the surviving company. 
Lease Arrangements [see also Note 15]
We have an operating lease agreement for office space being used in Vancouver, Canada, which expires in September 2015. 
The future minimum annual lease payments under the Vancouver lease is CAD$85,000 in 2015. 
In November 2006, prior to the Arrangement, Sonus entered into a non-cancellable operating lease agreement for office space in Bothell, Washington, expiring in 2017 Note 7. In connection with the lease, Sonus was required to provide a cash security deposit of approximately $05 million, which is included in Other Assets. In addition, a standby letter of credit was issued by us in 2010, and $03 million remains in a restricted money market account as collateral. We recorded a liability in the excess facilities lease charge of $02 million as at December31, 2014 Note 7. In February 2015, we entered into a Lease Termination Agreement with BMR-217TH BMR Place to terminate the lease, effective March 1, 2015. Under the Lease Termination Agreement, we will pay BMR a $20 million termination fee no later than the Termination Date and a contingent termination fee of $13 million, payable 30 days after we i meets the primary endpoint for our phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of second line metastatic CRPC with custirsen and ii closes a transaction or transactions pursuant to which we receive funding in an aggregate amount of at least $200 million. BMR will also draw approximately $01 million on our letter of credit with respect to its payment of deferred state sales tax and, when paid, will terminate any remaining balance on the letter of credit. No later than March 31, 2015, BMR will return to us the security deposit under the Terminated Lease, less any amounts deductible in accordance with the terms of the Terminated Lease, see also Note 15.
The remaining future minimum annual lease payments under the terminated Bothell lease are as follows in thousands: 2015 386 2016 Remainder Total 386 Consolidated rent and operating expense relating to both the Vancouver, Canada and Bothell, Washington offices for years ended December31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $28 million, $28 million and $27 million, respectively. 
Guarantees and Indemnifications 
We indemnify our officers, directors and certain consultants for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the officer or director is or was serving at its request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is equal to the officers or directors lifetime. 
The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, we have obtained director and officer insurance that limits our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe that the fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. Accordingly, we have not recognized any liabilities relating to these obligations as of December31, 2014. 
We have certain agreements with certain organizations with which it does business that contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which it typically agrees to indemnify the party against certain types of third-party claims. We accrue for known indemnification issues when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. There were no accruals for or expenses related to indemnification issues for any period presented.
