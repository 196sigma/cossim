REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Riviana Foods Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Riviana
Foods Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of June 29, 1997, and
June 30, 1996, and the related consolidated statements of income, capital
accounts and retained earnings, other equity accounts and cash flows for each of
the three fiscal years in the period ended June 29, 1997. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Riviana
Foods Inc. and subsidiaries as of June 29, 1997, and June 30, 1996, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal
years in the period ended June 29, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Effective July 3, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities. Effective July 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of, and SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. As allowed by SFAS No. 123, the Company elected to continue to
account for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No. 25, and, accordingly, will recognize no compensation expense
for stock options granted, as all option plans require that the option exercise
price be equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant. See
Note 11 for the pro forma impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123. Effective January
1, 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. The effect
of adopting these statements had no material impact on the results of
operations. The initial effect of adopting SFAS No. 115 was recorded as an
increase in stockholders' equity of $2,125, net of taxes.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, was issued in February 1997. The
Company will adopt SFAS No. 128 in the second quarter of 1998. When adopted,
SFAS No. 128 requires the retroactive restatement of all earnings per share
reported. Had the Company adopted the statement in the current year, earnings
per share would have been as follows                       1997    1996     1995
$  127 $  116    $ 96
126    115     96
SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, was issued in June 1997.
The Company will adopt SFAS No. 130 in the first quarter of 1999. Had SFAS No.
130 been adopted as of June 29, 1997, net income, as reported, would have been
adjusted by changes in unrealized gains on marketable securities, net of taxes,
and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment.

RIVIANA FOODS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent gains and losses at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For purposes of the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated
statements of cash flows, the Company considers all investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to its
customers. The Company regularly reviews the accounts and makes adequate
provision for any potentially uncollectible balances. Management believes that
the Company has no significant concentrations of credit risk and has incurred no
impairments in the carrying values of its accounts receivable, other than that
for which provision has been made.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
on the first-in, first-out FIFO method. Inventories were composed of the
following                      JUNE 29, 1997  JUNE 30, 1996
Raw    $ 8,555     $10,697

Packaging     6,738      7,194
$48,454     $52,884
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Land, buildings, machinery and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is provided for financial reporting purposes on the straight-line basis over the
following estimated useful lives   30 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment.   3 to 15 years
Maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are charged against income as
incurred; major replacements and betterments are capitalized. The cost of assets
sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the
accounts at the time of disposition, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected
as other income or expense for the period.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The assets and liabilities of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are
translated into United States dollars at exchange rates in effect at the date of
the financial statements. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average
rates during the reporting periods. Resulting translation gains and losses are
accumulated as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Because the Company
follows the policy of not providing taxes on unremitted foreign earnings as
discussed in Note 6, such translation gains and losses are not tax effected.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist primarily of cash, cash
equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and debt instruments. The Company
periodically reviews these instruments for any impairment of value and records a
provision for any impairment identified. The book values of these instruments
are considered to be representative of their respective fair values.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments as hedges to manage a
portion of its exposure to currency fluctuations related to inventory purchases.
These instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, accordingly, gains
and losses on these instruments are deferred and included in the basis of the
inventory hedged. The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge
specific product commitments. The contracts have varying maturities with none
exceeding twelve months and are settled at maturity, based on rates agreed to at
the inception of the contracts. At June 29, 1997, the Company had established
bank lines available to purchase forward exchange contracts in the amount of
$41,645, of which $14,724 was outstanding. Gains and losses deferred in
outstanding instruments at year end were immaterial. As a matter of policy, the
Company does not engage in foreign currency speculation and does not hedge to
protect the translated results of foreign operations or other economic exposures
for which speculative accounting treatment of the hedging instrument would be
required.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified to conform with the
current-year presentation.
3 MARKETABLE SECURITIES   Investments in debt and equity securities are recorded as required by SFAS
No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.
The Company marketable securities consist of high-grade equity securities that
are all considered available for sale. Available-for-sale securities, securities
that the Company purchased without any specific intent to sell in the near term,
are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included directly in
stockholders' equity, net of applicable deferred income taxes. The basis upon
which costs were determined in computing realized gains was specific
identification.

Riviana has a defined contribution plan which covers substantially all
United States employees. The Company contributes an amount equal to a percentage
of employee contributions. Total expense related to this plan was $547, $403 and
$476 during 1997, 1996 and 1995.
Riviana provides death and additional retirement benefits to certain key
employees. These plans are funded through Company-owned life insurance. The net
cash surrender value of the insurance policies is recorded as a noncurrent asset
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The actuarially computed
present value of the retirement benefits is recorded as an other noncurrent
liability in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded expense of
$204, $175 and $149 related to these plans for 1997, 1996 and 1995.
8 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   The Company paid $1,318, $2,234 and $1,144 for 1997, 1996 and 1995, to W.
Elton Kennedy, a director of the Company, or entities controlled by him for rice
purchases at market prices. Also, the Company and Kennedy Rice Dryers, Inc., a
corporation of which Mr. Kennedy is the principal stockholder and a director and
officer, each owns a 50% interest in South LaFourche Farm Partnership. The
Company and Mr. Kennedy are each contingently liable on a $2,143 promissory note
payable by the Partnership. The Company has also executed transactions with
other companies owned by certain directors which were not material to the
Company results of operations. Management of the Company believes that the
foregoing transactions were on terms no less favorable to the Company than could
normally be obtained from unaffiliated parties.

LITIGATION
Various actions and claims, which arose in the ordinary course of business,
are pending against the Company. In the opinion of management, the ultimate
liability, if any, which may result from these actions and claims will not
materially affect the financial position or future results of operations of the
Company.
BUY-SELL AGREEMENT
As of June 29, 1997, the Company had an $8,216 investment in Boost which
represents a 49% ownership interest. The Boost stockholder agreement provides,
effective in 1997, that either stockholder has the right to purchase the other
interest. The initial bid price offered by one stockholder to the other, if not
accepted, would require the rejecting stockholder to counteroffer the initial
bid price plus five percent. Each rejection thereafter would also require a five
percent premium over the prior offer until one stockholder accepts.
10 CAPITAL STOCK  COMMON STOCK
At June 29, 1997, the Company has outstanding 2,068 shares of common stock
sold before the initial public offering to directors, officers and key employees
of the Company or Boost at a discount of $2,171. The amount of discount was
determined by the Board of Directors and represents a percentage reduction of
about 50% from the formula based estimate of fair value at the time of sale. The
majority of the shares discounted were sold as an inducement for predecessor
management to continue employment and to participate in the initial
capitalization of the Company in 1986. The discount is recorded in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements as a reduction of stockholders'
equity. Under a contractual agreement with the stockholders, the discount must
be repaid when the shares are sold.
There were no sales of common stock at a discount in 1997 or 1996. In 1995,
5 shares of common stock were sold for the formula based estimate of fair value
of $33 less a discount of $16.
On December 28, 1994, the stockholders of the Company approved a
twelve-for-one split of common stock and an increase in par value from $01 per
share before the split to $100 per share after the split. Accordingly, all
common share references in the financial statements have been restated to
reflect the split, unless otherwise indicated.
The Company common stock trades on The Nasdaq Stock Market trading
symbol RVFD.
PREFERRED STOCK
At June 29, 1997, 5,000 shares of $100 per share par value preferred stock
are authorized. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.
11 STOCK OPTION PLANS   On December 28, 1994, the Company stockholders adopted an incentive stock
option plan 1994 Plan. On October 11, 1995, the Company stockholders adopted
a non-employee directors stock option plan 1995 NEDSOP which was retroactively
effective May 17, 1995. Collectively, these are the Plans.
Under the 1994 Plan, a total of 795 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance pursuant to options that may be granted by a committee of
the Board of Directors to eligible employees of the Company or Boost, including
officers. Options granted allow the holders of the options to purchase shares of
common stock at the fair market value on the date of the grant for a period of
ten years. No options will become exercisable sooner than one year after the
date of the grant.
The 1995 NEDSOP, as amended, permits the issuance of options to purchase up
to 250 shares of common stock to directors who are not employees of the Company
and who beneficially own less than 2% of the outstanding common stock of the
Company. Such directors receive options to purchase 2 shares annually on May 17.
Options granted allow holders of the options to purchase shares of common stock
at the fair market value on the date of the grant for a period of ten years. No
options will become exercisable sooner than one year after the date of the
grant.

contractual life in years of 83 years.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for options granted under
the Plans. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Had
compensation expense been determined based on the Black-Scholes option pricing
model value at the grant date for awards in 1997 and 1996 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company net income and earnings per share would have been as follows                       1997    1996

Earnings per share:

The SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options granted
prior to July 3, 1995, and the resulting pro forma compensation expense may not
be indicative of pro forma expense in future years.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model was used to value the grants issued
in 1997 and 1996. The weighted average value and the assumptions used were as
