REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Transaction Network Services, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Transaction
Network Services, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1997 and 1996, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Transaction Network
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

TRANSACTION NETWORK SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Transaction Network Services, Inc. the Company or TNS was incorporated
in August 1990 to build and operate a communications network focused on the
network services needs of the  POS transaction
processing industry. In June 1991 the Company transmitted its first POS
transaction, and since then has increased its average daily transaction volume
from approximately 17,000 in the third quarter of 1991 to more than 71 million
in the fourth quarter of 1997. In June 1994, the Company acquired Fortune
Telecommunications, Inc. FTI of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, which provides
customers in the telecommunications industry with telephone call fraud control
and billing validation services. In June 1996, the Company formed Transaction
Network Services Limited TNSL, a majority-owned subsidiary. TNSL provides
POS network services in Ireland and serves as TNS' European technology and
marketing center to support current and future European operations. In October
1997, through TNSL, the Company acquired a majority interest in Pronoma Systems
AB. This company has been renamed Transaction Network Services
TNS AB TNSAB and operates as a TNS subsidiary located in Stockholm, Sweden.
The Company currently operates four divisions: 1 The POS Division which
includes the Company TransXpress-Registered Trademark- network services for
the POS transaction processing industry, 2 The Telecom Services Division
TSD which includes FTI CARD*TEL-Registered Trademark- telephone call
billing validation and fraud control services and other services targeting
primarily the telecommunications industry, 3 The Financial Services Division
FSD which provides TNS' FastLink-Registered Trademark- Data Service in
support of the Financial Information eXchange FIX messaging protocol and
other transaction oriented trading applications primarily to the financial
services community, and 4 The International Systems Division ISD which
markets the Company products and services internationally.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.
The majority of the Company revenues are derived from the transmission of
POS transactions predominantly credit and debit card transactions, which are
processed electronically by a small number of third party POS transaction
processors. The Company TransXpress-Registered Trademark- network services
implement proprietary technology that provides a communications link between the
merchant site and the transaction processor. The Company markets its
TransXpress-Registered Trademark- network services directly to third party POS
transaction processors, who in turn resell the Company network services as a
part of the processors' own services.
The Company CARD*TEL-Registered Trademark- telecommunications services
utilize proprietary fraud control technology and databases to provide real-time
telephone call billing validation and fraud control services to the
telecommunications industry, including long distance telephone companies,
operator services providers, information services providers and private pay
telephone companies.
The majority of the Company international activities are located in the
United Kingdom UK, Canada, Ireland, and Sweden. In the UK and Canada, the
Company has entered into technology transfer arrangements whereby TNS provides
POS equipment and proprietary billing and network software. Under these
arrangements the Company receives recurring revenues in the form of software
license and maintenance fees, and royalties based on revenues generated by its
international customers. The Company began to recognize royalty revenue under
these arrangements in 1997. TNSL provides POS network services primarily in
Ireland. TNSAB serves as TNS' hub for providing transaction transport services
throughout the Scandinavian countries.
The TNS FastLink-Registered Trademark- Data Service routes FIX protocol
messages over a secure TCP/IP network developed, operated and maintained by TNS.
The service includes primarily electronic communication of indications of
interest, orders and execution reports which are normally phoned between traders
or transmitted via proprietary systems.
35
The Company operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
including, among others, reliance on major customers, rapidly changing
technology, limited suppliers, current and potential competitors with
significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources and
government regulation.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
DILUTED AND BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
On March 3, 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB released
Statement No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Statement No. 128 requires a dual
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share
excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock. The Company previously reported primary earnings
per share amounts are identical to the diluted earnings per share amounts under
Statement No. 128. The Company adopted Statement No. 128 in 1997 and restated
all previously reported per share amounts. Options to purchase 74,967 shares of
common stock in the price range of $1438 through $2017 per share were
outstanding during 1997 but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the
average market price of the common shares. The options expire on dates ranging
from September 18, 2005 to December 18, 2007.

Basic earnings per  $    060 $    047 $    046
RECENT AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive
Income and Statement No. 131 Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. Statement No. 130 requires the Company to present an
aggregate amount of comprehensive income and the components of other
comprehensive income in its 1998 financial statements and/or notes thereto. The
Company only component of other comprehensive income consists of foreign
currency translation adjustments and has not been material. Statement No. 131
will require the Company to disclose segment information using a management
approach beginning with its December 31, 1998 financial statements.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company considers all securities purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments at
the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet
date. At December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company marketable securities
consisted primarily of money market accounts classified as cash equivalents,
U.S.
36
government and government agency securities, investment grade corporate bonds,
and overnight reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents,
all of which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold until
maturity. These securities are reported at amortized cost. The contractual
maturities of held to maturity securities ranges from under one year to
twenty-two months.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate
that value:
CURRENT ASSETS AND CURRENT LIABILITIES
The carrying amount approximated fair value because of the short maturity of
those instruments.
INVESTMENTS
At December 31, 1997, the fair values of marketable securities based on
quoted market prices, on national exchanges approximated the carrying amounts.
Certain of the Company financial instruments included in investments have no
quoted market prices. However, the Company believes by reference to stated
interest rates and security held, the fair value of the assets would not differ
materially from their carrying values.
CREDIT RISK
The Company assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of
cash equivalents, investments including non-marketable securities of
approximately $36 million, and accounts receivable. Accounts receivable consist
of geographically dispersed customers, and the Company has not experienced
significant losses related to uncollectible accounts from its POS customers.
Revenues from its telecommunications services customers, are subject to a higher
degree of credit risk than is the case for the Company POS services customers.
The Company reserves for the credit risk associated with this customer base.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company long-lived assets consist of network equipment and intangible
assets. The Company periodically reviews the value of its assets to determine if
an impairment has occurred. The Company considers expected cash flows and
estimated future operating results, trends, and other available information in
assessing whether the carrying value of the assets is impaired.
EQUIPMENT
Network and office equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is
calculated using the straight-line method. Network equipment is depreciated over
estimated useful lives of three to five years. Office equipment is depreciated
over estimated useful lives of three to ten years.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are being amortized over useful lives ranging from five to
ten years.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes services revenue as the related services are
performed. Advance payments for services are deferred and recognized as revenue
when earned. POS services revenue is derived primarily from the transmission
through its network of transaction information between merchant or service
provider POS terminals and transaction-processing computer centers. TSD revenue
consists primarily of fees charged on a per query basis to customers for
telephone call fraud-control and billing validation services. FSD revenue is
derived primarily from monthly recurring fees. International revenue consists
primarily of royalties, software license
37
fees and equipment sales. Revenue from equipment sales is recognized upon
shipment. Revenue from maintenance and software licenses is recognized ratably
over the term of the agreement. Revenue from royalties are recognized when
earned.
COST OF NETWORK SERVICES
Cost of network services principally includes usage charges for data
transmission and database access, leased digital transmission capacity charges,
transmission capacity installation charges, activation charges, salaries,
equipment maintenance and other related network costs. These costs are expensed
by the Company at the time such costs are incurred. Depreciation expense on
network equipment was $4,124,000, $3,623,000 and $2,811,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, and is included in depreciation
expense.
ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditures for engineering and development activities are charged to
expense as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No.
109. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based
upon the difference between financial statement and income tax bases of assets
and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expense
or credits are based upon the changes in the asset or liability from period to
period.
MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES
In 1996, the Company formed TNSL in Ireland. In 1997, through TNSL, the
Company purchased a majority interest in TNSAB. The Company has provided the
minority shareholders of TNSL and TNSAB the right to put their shares to the
Company at the fair value of the shares at the exercise date. The Company also
has the right to call the minority shares at fair value. Both the put and call
provisions related toTNSL expire in 2007. The put and call provisions related to
TNSAB expire in 2003. Proforma information related to the TNSAB acquisition is
not included herein as the acquisition was not material.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform
with the current year presentation.
2. INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS:
On June 30, 1995, the Company purchased from Intellicall, Inc.
Intellicall certain contract rights related to Intellicall telephone call
validation and fraud control services, including Intellicall validation
services contracts with customers. The Company also purchased a validation
services contract with Intellicall and an exclusive U.S. license to
Intellicall VICS software excluding certain markets. Intellicall agreed not
to compete for ten years with the Company in the provision of validation
services and to exclusively market the Company validation services to
Intellicall customers excepting, in each case, such excluded markets. The
Company paid $3 million in cash for these intangible assets. The Company is
amortizing the cost of these assets over ten years. The Company also prepaid
$15 million to Intellicall for billing services. The Company is recording the
expense as the services are provided, based upon volume of transactions covered
by the agreement.
On March 29, 1996, the Company completed an asset purchase from AMNEX, Inc.
AMNEX of AMNEX proprietary fraud-control system and related databases used
to provide fraud control and billing validation services. The transaction also
included a ten year exclusive service agreement, a joint marketing agreement to
cross-sell each other services and a warrant agreement giving the Company the
right to purchase
38
100,000 shares of AMNEX Common Stock. The Company paid approximately $15
million in cash for these assets. The Company amortizes the cost of these assets
over five to ten years.
In 1997, in connection with obtaining new customers for the Company
service offerings, the Company made certain strategic investments discussed
below.
In July 1997, the Company obtained a five year exclusive data services
agreement and a joint marketing agreement from a customer. The Company invested
$20 million in this customer in the form of subordinated convertible debt.
Interest is payable each August, beginning in August 1998. Alternatively, the
customer may issue an additional note equal to the accrued interest on terms and
with rights identical to the original note. At any time, the Company may convert
all or any portion of the principal plus accrued interest into a minority
interest in the customers' common stock. The customer may redeem up to 50% of
the debt at any time up until August 1999 at a specified annual internal rate of
return. The principal and any unpaid accrued interest matures in August 2005,
and as a result, the investment is recorded as a long-term investment. This
investment is classified as an available for sale security due to its conversion
provisions. Fair value approximated carrying value at December 31, 1997.
In July 1997, the Company obtained agreements to provide
CARD*TEL-Registered Trademark- services for a five year period from a customer.
The Company paid this customer $500,000 for a software license to use the
customers' proprietary call monitoring and screening system and related
databases along with an option the Option to purchase a minority ownership
interest in the customer. The Option is exercisable beginning in June 1998 and
expires in June 2002. The customer may cancel a portion of the Option at an
escalating call price. The Company is amortizing the cost of the software
license over five years. The Company also loaned the customer $250,000 as a term
loan the Term Loan and $12 million under a secured revolving credit
agreement the Revolver. In October 1997 all amounts due under the Revolver
were repaid. The remaining Term Loan is secured by certain collateral, interest
is payable monthly, and principal payments are due in three annual payments on
the next three loan anniversary dates.
In August 1997, the Company loaned a customer $500,000 under a secured term
loan. Interest is payable monthly and principal is due in February 1998. The
customer repaid $100,000 of principal in 1997.
In November 1997, the Company loaned a vendor $500,000. Principal and
interest are payable in November 1998. In connection with this loan the Company
received the exclusive European distribution rights to the borrowers' products
used in connection with the provision of POS and automated teller machine
services. A limited partnership the Partnership controlled by the Company
Chief Executive Officer and a venture capital firm, one of whose partners is a
Company director, are minority shareholders in this company. The Company loan
is guaranteed by the Partnership.
In December 1997, the Company executed a $450,000 secured term note with a
POS customer. The principal balance includes the conversion of approximately
$316,000 of outstanding accounts receivable. Interest is payable monthly
beginning February 1998. Principal is payable in 36 monthly installments
beginning January 2000. The note is secured by certain collateral including the
stock of the borrower.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In 1994, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
Eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the
semi-annual purchase of Common Stock. Under the terms of the plan, 150,000
shares of authorized Common Stock were reserved for purchase at 85% of the fair
market price at the beginning or end of each six-month offering period,
whichever is lower. During 1995,
41
employees purchased 6,925 shares at $751 per share and 8,799 shares at $889
per share. During 1996, employees purchased 9,124 shares at $1218 per share and
14,582 shares at $1020 per share. During 1997, employees purchased 11,265
shares at $1020 per share and 12,958 shares at $1094 per share. The weighted
average fair value for shares purchased under the ESPP was $360 for 1997, $279
for 1996 and $170 for 1995.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option and stock purchase plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant date for awards in 1997, 1996, and 1995 consistent with
the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per
share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:
1997    1996    1995
Net Earnings thousands--pro  $  6,667 $  5,633 $  5,042
Diluted earnings per share--pro  $  053 $  045 $  044
Basic earnings per share--pro  $  054 $  046 $  045
The fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. For 1995 grants, the following weighted-average
assumptions used: dividend yield of 0%, expected volatility of 48%; risk-free
interest rate of 594%; and expected lives of approximately 3 years. For 1996
grants, the following weighted-average assumptions were used: dividend yield of
0%, expected volatility of 49%; risk-free interest rate of 55%; and expected
lives of approximately 3 years. For 1997 grants, the following weighted-average
assumptions were used: a dividended yield of 0%; expected volatility of 51 risk-free interest of 546%; and expected lives of approximately 3 years. The
effects of applying SFAS No. 123 in the proforma disclosure are not indicative
of future amounts. SFAS No. 123 does not apply to awards prior to 1995.
7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
OPERATING LEASES
The Company leases office space under operating leases. On September 21,
1995, the Company entered into an office lease with Pond Building, L.L.C.
commencing in March 1996 on an office building the Office Building which it
uses as its headquarters facility. The lease term is 12 years and payments
escalate every year based on a factor tied to the change in the Consumer Price
Index, but not to exceed 3% per annum. In connection with this lease, the
Company loaned the purchaser of the building $36 million which was repaid with
interest in 1996. The Company also leases space for network equipment sites and
certain office equipment under operating leases. Future annual commitments under
the Company operating leases are as follows:

The Company has a 401k profit sharing plan which covers eligible
employees. The Company makes discretionary matching contributions to the plan.
For 1994, the Company Board of Directors elected to make a
42
matching contribution in the form of Common Stock in lieu of cash. Matching
shares were issued at market price on the date of the Board of Directors'
election and have a vesting period of 3 years. The Company issued 5,319 in 1995
as a 1994 contribution. For 1995, a discretionary matching contribution of
10,754 shares was approved and was issued in 1996. For 1997 and 1996, the

25% of each eligible employee contribution made during each year to be paid
in cash.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
A significant portion of the Company revenue is made to a limited number
of customers. For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company
recorded sales to these customers as follows in thousands:
1997    1996    1995
Customer  $ 11,105 $  8,962 $  6,614
Customer      *   6,244   5,059
Customer      *     *   4,147
-  
*  Revenue was less than 10% of total revenues for the period.
In June 1995, the Company then sixth largest customer purchased the
Company then largest customer. The above sales amounts reflect this
transaction, and other combinations, as if they had occurred on January 1, 1995.
Certain key components used in the Company network are currently available
only from limited sources. The Company does not have long-term supply contracts
with these or any other limited source vendors and purchases network equipment
on a purchase order basis. The inability to obtain sufficient quantities of
limited source equipment as required, or to develop alternative sources as
required in the future, could result in delays or reductions in the Company
development and deployment of network equipment, which could adversely affect
the Company business, operating results and financial condition. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had long term commitments to purchase
approximately $38 million in capital equipment of which $710,000 is contingent
upon delivery of development milestones by a vendor. Except for these
arrangements, the Company does not have long-term supply contracts.
