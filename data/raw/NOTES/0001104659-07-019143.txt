47 REPORT OF GRANT THORNTON LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Polymer Group, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Polymer Group, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries the
Company as of December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders equity and
comprehensive income loss and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Polymer Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2006 and
December 31, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming
an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule titled Schedule II Valuation
and Qualifying Accounts is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is
not a required part of the basic financial statements. The amounts on this schedule for the years
ended December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, have been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. 
As discussed in Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No. 123 revised 2004,
Share-Based Payment and, effective December 30, 2006, the Company adopted the
provisions of FASB Statement No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Retirement Plans: an amendment of FASB Statements No.
87, 88, 106, and 132R. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Polymer Group, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over
financial reporting as of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March 13,
2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Polymer Group,Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows
of Polymer Group,Inc. for the year ended January1, 2005. Our audit
also included the data related to the periods referenced in the preceding
sentence included in the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
a. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for ouropinion.
In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of Polymer Group,Inc.
for the year ended January1, 2005 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates. Also, in our opinion,

basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. s/ Ernst Young, LLP

Note1.Background
and Basis of Consolidation
Background
Polymer Group,Inc. the Company is a publicly-traded,
multinational manufacturer, marketer and seller of nonwoven and oriented
polyolefin products. The Company is one of the worlds leading producers of
nonwovens, and is a global, technology-driven developer, producer and marketer
of engineered materials. With the broadest range of process technologies in the
nonwovens industry, the Company is a global supplier to leading consumer and
industrial product manufacturers. The Company operates 21 manufacturing
facilities in nine countries throughout the world. The Companys main sources
of revenue are the sales of primary and intermediate products to the medical,
hygiene, wipes, industrial and specialty markets.
The Company, upon having its
Modified Plan, as defined the Modified Plan, approved by the Bankruptcy
Court on January16, 2003, emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings
effective March5, 2003 the Effective Date. For accounting purposes
the Company recognized the emergence on March1, 2003, which was the end
of the February2003 accounting period. In accordance with AICPA Statement
of Position 90-7, Financial Reporting of Entities in Reorganization
under the Bankruptcy Code SOP 90-7, the Company adopted fresh-start
accounting as of March1, 2003, and the Companys emergence from Chapter
11 resulted in a new reporting entity. The reorganization value of the Company
has been allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities based on their
respective fair values at the date of emergence.
Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of Polymer Group,Inc. and all
majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions. The accounts of all foreign subsidiaries have been
included on the basis of fiscal periods ended on the same dates as the
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts are presented in
U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted.
Note2.Accounting
Policies and Financial Statement Information
Fiscal Year
The Companys fiscal year ends
on the Saturday nearest to December31. Fiscal 2006 ended December30,
2006 and included the results of operations for a fifty-two week period. Fiscal
2005 ended December31, 2005 and included the results of operations for a
fifty-two week period. Fiscal 2004 ended January1, 2005 and included the
results of operations for a fifty-two week period.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts previously
presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have been
reclassified to conform with the current year classification.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  54  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
The reorganization value of the Companys common
equity of approximately $734million at March1, 2003 was determined
based on an independent valuation by financial specialists after consideration
of multiple factors and by using various valuation methodologies and evaluating
other relevant industry information. The reorganization value of the Company
was allocated to the various assets and liabilities based on their respective
fair values pursuant to fresh start accounting principles. The calculated
reorganization value of the Company was based on a variety of estimates and
assumptions about future circumstances and events. Such estimates and
assumptions are inherently subject to significant economic uncertainties.
An allowance for doubtful accounts is established by
the Company based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific
customers, historical trends and other information. Management believes that
the allowance is adequate to cover potential losses resulting from
uncollectible accounts. Additionally, sales returns and allowances, a component
of net sales, are recorded in the period in which the related sales are
recorded. Management bases its estimate of the expense to be recorded each
period on historical return and allowance levels.
The Company maintains reserves for inventories valued
primarily using the first in, first out FIFO method. Such reserves for
inventories can be specific to certain inventory or general based on judgments
about the overall condition of the inventory. General reserves are established
based on percentage write-downs applied to inventories aged for certain
time periods or for inventories which are considered slow-moving. Specific
reserves are established based on a determination of the obsolescence of the
inventory and whether the inventory value exceeds amounts to be recovered
through expected sales price, less selling costs. Estimating sales prices,
establishing write-down percentages and evaluating the condition of the
inventories require judgments and estimates, which may impact the inventory
valuation and gross profits.
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not
be recoverable. For assets held and used, an impairment may occur if projected
undiscounted cash flows are not adequate to cover the carrying value of the
assets. In such cases, additional analysis is conducted to determine the amount
of the loss to be recognized. The impairment loss is determined by the
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the fair value
primarily measured by future discounted cash flows. The analysis, when
conducted, requires estimates of the amount and timing of projected cash flows
and, where applicable, judgments associated with, among other factors, the
appropriate discount rate. Such estimates are critical in determining whether
any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of such charge if an
impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. In addition, future events impacting
cash flows for existing assets could render a write-down necessary that
previously required no write-down.
For assets held for disposal, an impairment charge is
recognized if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value less
costs to sell. Estimates are required of fair value, disposal costs and the
time period to dispose of the assets. Such estimates are critical in
determining whether any impairment charge should be recorded and the amount of
such charge if an impairment loss is deemed to be necessary. Actual cash flows
received could differ from those used in estimating the impairment loss, which
would impact the impairment charge ultimately recognized. 55  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued The Company recorded the accretion of dividends on the
16% SeriesA Convertible Pay-in-kind Preferred Shares the PIK Preferred
Shares based on the stated rate of 160% in the PIK Preferred Shares. If the
Companys Board of Directors, at the date of any dividend declaration, elected
to satisfy the dividend obligation by payment-in-kind, the Company recognized
an additional dividend charge for the excess, if any, of the fair value of the
additional PIK Preferred Shares issued, at the dividend declaration date, over
the amounts previously accrued at the stated rate. As the Companys PIK
Preferred Shares were not traded on an active market, determination of the fair
value of the securities, at the date of dividend declaration, required
estimates and judgments, which may have impacted the valuation of the dividends
paid-in-kind. Based on the fact that the PIK Preferred Shares were
deep-in-the money, the Company estimated the fair value of the PIK Preferred
Shares using the number of shares of the Companys ClassA Common Stock
into which the PIK Preferred Shares were convertible at the then-current share
price of the Companys ClassA Common Stock. While the Company believes
its estimates of the fair value of the PIK Preferred Shares are reasonable, the
utilization of different assumptions could produce materially different fair
value estimates.
The Company has pension and postretirement plans with
costs and obligations which are dependent on assumptions used by actuaries in
calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, inflation
rates, salary growth percentages, long-term return on plan assets, retirement
rates, mortality rates and other factors. While the Company believes that the
assumptions used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience
or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and
postretirement costs and obligations.
The Company estimates the fair value of stock option
grants for measuring compensation costs using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, which model is dependent on certain assumptions. These assumptions
include expected dividend yield, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate,
forfeitures and expected lives. Although the Company believes the assumptions
utilized are appropriate, differing assumptions would affect compensation
costs.
The Company has estimated the fair values of financial
instruments as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, using
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop
estimates of fair value for non-traded financial instruments. Accordingly, such
estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would
realize in a current market exchange. The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets and
accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of their fair
values. Fair value of the Companys debt was estimated using interest rates at
those dates for issuance of such financial instruments with similar terms,
credit ratings and remaining maturities and other independent valuation
methodologies. The estimated fair value of debt, based on such valuation
methodologies, at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005 was $4112
million and $4152 million, respectively.
During fiscal 2005, the
estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment utilized in the
Companys operations were reduced to reflect the technological status and
market conditions of certain aspects of the Companys business. These changes
in estimates resulted in increased depreciation charges of approximately $34
million in each of the fiscal years 2006 and 2005. 56  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is
recognized when title and risks of ownership pass to the customer. This is
generally on the date of shipment to the customer, or upon delivery to a place
named by the customer, dependent upon contract terms and when collectibility is
reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenue includes
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling. Provision for rebates,
promotions, product returns and discounts to customers is recorded as a
reduction in determining revenue in the same period that the revenue is recognized.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents are defined
as short-term investments having an original maturity of three months or less.
Interest income is presented as a reduction of Interest
expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations
and consists primarily of income from highly liquid investment sources.
Interest income approximated $05 million, $10 million and $02million
during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Accounts Receivable and
Concentration of Credit Risks
Accounts receivable
potentially expose the Company to a concentration of credit risk, as defined by
SFAS No105, Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentration of Credit
Risk. The Company provides credit in the normal course of business and
performs ongoing credit evaluations on its customers financial condition, as
deemed necessary, but generally does not require collateral to support such
receivables. Customer balances are considered past due based on contractual
terms and the Company does not accrue interest on the past due balances. Also,
in an effort to reduce its credit exposure to certain customers, as well as
accelerate its cash flows, the Company has sold on a non-recourse basis,
certain of its receivables pursuant to factoring agreements. The provision for
losses on uncollectible accounts is determined principally on the basis of past
collection experience applied to ongoing evaluations of the Companys receivables
and evaluations of the risk of repayment. The allowance for doubtful accounts
was approximately $76 million and $96 million at December30, 2006 and December31,
2005, respectively, which management believes is adequate to provide for credit
losses in the normal course of business, as well as losses for customers who
have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws. Once management determines
that the receivables are not recoverable, the amounts are removed from the
financial records along with the corresponding reserve balance. Of the $20
million decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts from December31,
2005 to December30, 2006, $15 million related to the write-off of
specifically identified uncollectible accounts receivable and the corresponding
reserve balance. In fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, The Procter
Gamble Company PG accounted for 13%, 14% and 12%, respectively, of the
Companys net sales.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market primarily using the FIFO method of accounting. 57  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Long-Lived Assets
Property, plant and equipment
is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed for
financial reporting purposes on the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives established for
building and improvements range from 18 to 31years, and the estimated
useful lives established for machinery, equipment and other fixed assets range
from 2 to 15years. Costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to
expense as incurred. Costs of the construction of certain long-lived assets
include capitalized interest that is amortized over the estimated useful life
of the related asset. The Company capitalized approximately $31 million, $22 million
and $04million of interest costs during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively.
Derivatives
The Company records all derivative instruments as
either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value in
accordance with SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended SFAS No133. Changes
in the fair value of a derivative are recorded each period in current earnings
or other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated
as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, depending on the type of hedge
transaction. Ineffective portions, if any, of all hedges are recognized in
current period earnings.
As more fully described in Note14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company, in the normal course of
business, periodically enters into derivative financial instruments,
principally swaps and forward contracts, with high-quality counterparties as
part of its risk management strategy. These financial instruments are limited
to non-trading purposes and are used principally to manage market risks and
reduce the Companys exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and interest
rates. Most interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts are designated
as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt obligations or fair value hedges of
foreign currency-denominated transactions.
The Company documents all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions and the methodologies that
will be used for measuring effectiveness and ineffectiveness. This process
includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow or fair value
hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
firm commitments. The Company then assesses, both at the hedges inception and
on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair
values or cash flows of hedged items. Such assessments are conducted in
accordance with the originally documented risk management strategy and
methodology for that particular hedging relationship.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of
recognized derivative gains and losses reclassified from other comprehensive
income is classified consistent with the classification of the hedged item. For
example, derivative gains and losses associated with hedges of interest rate payments
are recognized in Interest expense, net
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
For fair value hedges, changes
in the value of the derivatives, along with the offsetting changes in the fair
value of the underlying hedged exposure are recorded in earnings each period in
Foreign currency and other gain loss, net
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 58 POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes and corresponding
balance sheet accounts are determined in accordance with the liability method.
Tax provisions and credits are recorded at statutory rates for taxable items
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations regardless of the period
for which such items are reported for tax purposes. Additionally, federal
income taxes are provided on that portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries
that is expected to be remitted to the United States U.S. and be taxable.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based upon temporary
differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for income tax
and financial reporting purposes. A valuation allowance is established when it
is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis to analyze whether a change in circumstances
has occurred to provide enough evidence to support a change in the judgment
about the realization of the related deferred tax asset in future years.
Consistent with the provisions of SOP 90-7, recognition of tax benefits
from preconfirmation net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary
differences and other tax attributes not recognized at the Effective Date will
be applied to reduce goodwill to zero, then reduce intangible assets that
existed at the Effective Date with any excess tax benefits credited directly to
Additional Paid-in Capital.
Stock-Based
Compensation
Effective January1,
2006, the Company has elected to account for stock-based compensation
related to its employee share-based plans in accordance with the methodology
defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based
Payment SFAS No123R, using the modified prospective transition
method. Under the modified prospective transition method, the compensation
costs related to all new grants and any unvested portion of prior awards are
measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Additionally,
accruals for compensation costs for share-based awards with performance
conditions are based on the probable outcome of such performance conditions.
Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company elected to account for the share-based plans
in accordance with the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB No25, which generally measured compensation cost as the excess,
if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the date of grant over the
amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Additionally, as a percentage
of the share-based awards vested based on achievement of financial performance
criteria, compensation costs were recognized over the performance period when
it became probable that such performance criteria would be achieved. The pro
forma effect of utilizing SFAS No123Ron the  59  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued financial results for

The Company accounts for, and
reports, translation of foreign currency transactions and foreign currency
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No52, Foreign Currency
Translation. All assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of foreign
subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are
translated at period-end exchange rates, while income, expenses and cash flows
are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Translation gains
and losses are not included in determining net income, but are presented as a

translation adjustments and minimum pension liabilities which, prior to its
adoption, were reported separately in shareholders equity, to be included in
other comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive income of
$249million at December30. 2006 consisted of $314million of
currency translation gains, $80 million of transition net assets, gains or
losses and prior service costs not recognized as components of net periodic
benefit costs and $15million in cash flow hedge gains, all net of tax.
Accumulated other comprehensive income of $205million at December31,

Income Loss Per
Common Share
Basic earnings per share
exclude any dilutive effects of share-based awards and convertible securities
and are computed by dividing income loss applicable to common shareholders by

Recent Accounting
Standards
In July2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of
FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an
enterprises financial statements. This standard prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.
FIN 48 also provides guidance on other tax-related issues and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. Additionally, in February2007,
the FASB issued a Proposed Staff Position No.FIN 48-a, Definition
of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48, which implementation
guidance, if approved, may impact the timing of certain liability adjustments.
Accordingly, such additional guidance may impact the amounts that the Company
would record upon the adoption of FIN 48. The Company continues to evaluate the
effects of this standard.
In September2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin 108 SAB 108,
which expresses the SEC Staffs views regarding the process of quantifying
financial statement misstatements. The Company has applied the guidance in SAB
108 for the fourth quarter ended December30, 2006.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS No157. This standard establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and also provides guidance for an expanded
set of disclosure requirements related to fair value. The Company expects to
adopt SFAS No157 effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and has
not yet assessed the impact of SFAS No157 on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. 62 POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
In September2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Retirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No87, 88, 106 and 132R SFAS No158. SFAS No158
required employers to recognize the funded status of defined benefit
postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in the
plans funded status recognized as a component of other comprehensive income.
This standard also requires that the measurement of a plans funded status be
as of the date of the employers balance sheet. SFAS No158 also amends
certain of the previous disclosure requirements related to these plans and is
effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2006. In accordance
with SFAS No158, the Company recognized the funded status of its benefit
plans as of December30, 2006, resulting in an adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income in the amount of $27
million, net of tax, to initially apply the provisions of SFAS No158.

Asset impairment
charges
The Company has experienced a continued weakening of
earnings and cash flows in certain of its Canadian operations. As a result, the
Company, during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, evaluated such assets for
impairment, consistent with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge associated
with the write-down of such assets to estimated fair value in the amount of
approximately $55million. Additionally, during the second quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company initiated the restructuring and consolidation strategy
for the European operations, which included the closure of the facilities in
Sweden. Accordingly, the Company recognized an impairment charge, with respect
to such assets in the amount of $23 million, resulting in a total asset
impairment charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of $78 million.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
recorded an impairment charge in the amount of approximately $186 million
associated with the write-down of assets located in certain facilities in the
United States and Europe to estimated fair values. Of that total, $72 million
related to a manufacturing line located in The Netherlands, which write-down
was attributed to the expected shutdown of the line in fiscal 2007 due to the
loss of certain low-margin business platforms which were produced on the asset during
fiscal 2006 as the market price for the products moved to a level  63  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued resulting in unacceptable
margins. The remaining $114 million related to the write-down of assets in the
United States, including facilities for which the Company has announced closure
plans, as further discussed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, as well as an impairment charge taken with respect to another
facility, for which projected future cash flows have been negatively impacted
by the loss of a major automotive platform and the anticipated loss of certain
business for which the market prices have recently declined to a level
resulting in such unacceptable returns that the Company has elected not to
participate in such business going forward.
In fiscal 2004, the Company
recorded a non-cash asset impairment charge of $23million, primarily
related to the write-down of machinery and equipment to net realizable value,
for production assets in Canada removed from service and held for sale, and the
write-off of certain foreign investments.
Restructuring and plant
realignment costs
Accrued
costs for restructuring efforts are included in Accrued
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs
generally arise from restructuring initiatives intended to result in lower
working capital levels and improved operating performance and profitability
through: ireducing headcount at both the plant and corporate levels;
iiimproving manufacturing productivity and reducing corporate costs;
and iiirationalizing certain assets and businesses. A summary of the

which included termination benefits provided to an executive officer of the
Company, pursuant to Dutch law, in the amount of $21 million and costs
associated with the closure of the Sweden plant of $11million;
bcosts related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters to
Charlotte, North Carolina in the amount of $30 million; cdownsizing
certain Canadian operations resulting in severance costs of $06million;
and dcosts in the amount of $03 million related to exiting the leased
facilities at Gainesville, Georgia. 64  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Corporate headquarters
relocation
The Company entered into written relocation agreements
with 22employees who agreed to the relocation and to acceptance of
benefits offered by the Company. Such relocation benefits charged to operations
of $15 million during fiscal 2006 relate primarily to Company obligations for
costs associated with the employees real estate sales process, which process
has been completed by the electing employees. Additionally, the Company has
incurred approximately $05million associated with other exit costs.
The Company also incurred
approximately $10 million in severance costs relating to 23employees who
have not been offered or who have declined the opportunity to relocate. As the
employee must remain in the employ of the Company through the date of their
designated date for corporate relocation to be eligible for the severance,
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No146, the Company has accrued
the severance cost ratably over the expected service period.
European restructuring
In May2006, the Company entered into a
termination agreement with an executive officer of the Company that provided for
an aggregate payment of approximately $21 million, which was charged to
operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Additionally, the
Company and the executive officer entered into certain other consulting and
non-compete agreements, which costs will be charged to operations over future
periods.
Also during fiscal 2006, based
on the Companys restructuring and consolidation strategies previously noted,
the Company shut down its operation located in Sweden. This included a
reduction of 19 production and administrative staff positions. The Company
ceased these operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. As a result
of that decision, the Company recorded a $11million operating charge to
accrue for the costs of exiting the facility and severance paid to such terminated
employees.
Canadian restructuring
During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the Company
communicated a plan to affected employees that it planned to downsize one of
its facilities located in Canada. The restructuring plan included the reduction
of 26 production and administrative staff positions. As a result of this
decision, the Company recorded a $06 million charge to operations to cover the
costs of severance pay to these employees.
Additionally, during the first
quarter of fiscal 2006, as part of its restructuring and related cost reduction
measures, the Company negotiated certain changes with the union representing
the employees of one of the Companys Canadian operations, including a partial
curtailment of a defined benefit pension plan. No net gain or loss has been
incurred as a result of the partial curtailment. However, based on elections
made by plan participants during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and as
approved by Canadian regulatory authorities on January16, 2007, the
Company will incur a settlement loss associated with employees who have elected
to exit the plan. The loss incurred as a result of the partial settlement of
the defined benefit pension plan, in the amount of $45million, will be
recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 commensurate with governmental
approval of the terms of the settlement and upon fulfillment by the Company of
its funding requirements in the amount of $19million associated with the
approved settlement, which funding obligations were fulfilled in February2007. 65  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Restructuring in prior
periods
In 2004, the Company continued
the restructuring initiatives commenced in 2003 by curtailing production of
certain of its European assets and eliminating several production lines in the
Canadian operations of its Oriented Polymers Division. The European and
Canadian restructuring efforts in 2004 included the reduction of approximately
160 positions, resulting in a charge of approximately $19million for
severance and other plant realignment costs.
U.S. restructuring
As further described in Note
21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in January2007, the Company
communicated a plan to affected employees that it plans to close two of its
plants in the United States. Certain exit costs related to one of the
facilities, which is leased, in the amount of $03million, were accrued
in fiscal 2006. Other costs related to the plant realignment will be recognized
in fiscal 2007.
Abandoned acquisition
costs
During the first five months
of fiscal 2006, the Company actively pursued a potential acquisition. In
conjunction with this effort, the Company incurred approximately $40 million
of costs, which are primarily comprised of third-party professional fees.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the negotiations with respect to the
potential acquisition reached an impasse and the Company abandoned its efforts
to consummate the acquisition.
Investigation and
executive termination costs
During June2006, the Company and an equipment
supplier negotiated the resolution of a dispute and entered into two settlement
agreements, which documented the terms of the resolution. During the second and
third quarters of fiscal 2006, the Company and the Audit Committee of the Board
of Directors of the Company, with assistance from special counsel, conducted an
investigation which focused on a review of the settlement agreements and the
relationship of these agreements with certain equipment purchase contracts and
service agreements, which were negotiated between the Company and the equipment
supplier in or about the same time frame. As a result of these actions, the
Company concluded that the economic substance of the settlement agreements and
the equipment purchase contracts and service agreements were substantially
interdependent. On September21, 2006, the Board of Directors of the
Company asked the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President, Global
Purchasing to resign, pending receipt of their resignations, and relieved them
of their duties as officers of the Company. Shortly thereafter, the Company
entered into termination agreements with both executives. As a result of these
events, the Company has incurred costs with respect to the investigation,
termination benefits and ancillary costs in the amount of $11 million.
Arbitration settlement, net
During 2004, the Company
settled an issue with a major customer through arbitration and received
approximately $170million as settlement of the arbitration issues. Net
settlement proceeds of $131million, after providing for $39million
of costs and expenses associated with the arbitration, were included in Special charges credits, net in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal 2004. 66  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Note4. Accounts
Receivable Factoring Agreements
The Company has entered into a factoring agreement to
sell without recourse, certain U.S. company-based receivables to an unrelated
third-party financial institution. Under the current terms of the factoring
agreement, the maximum amount of outstanding advances at any one time is
$200million, which limitation was subject to change based on the level
of eligible receivables, restrictions on concentrations of receivables and the
historical performance of the receivables sold. Additionally, the Company has
entered into a factoring agreement to sell without recourse, certain non-U.S.
company-based receivables to an unrelated third-party financial
institution. Under the terms of the factoring agreement, the maximum amount of
outstanding advances at any one time is $100million, which limitation is
subject to change based on the level of eligible receivables, restrictions on
concentrations of receivables and the historical performance of the receivables
sold.
Approximately $1902million, $1300 million and
$310 million of receivables have been sold under the terms of the factoring
agreements during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The sale of
these receivables accelerated the collection of the Companys cash, reduced
credit exposure and lowered the Companys net borrowing costs. Sales of
accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of Accounts receivable, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
and any loss recognized on the sale is reflected in Foreign
currency and other gain loss, net in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations on such sales, as they meet the applicable criteria of SFAS No140,Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of
Liabilities SFASNo140. The amount due from the factoring
companies, net of advances received from the factoring companies, was
$66million and $61million at December30, 2006 and December31,2005,
respectively, and is shown in Other current
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company pays
factoring fees associated with the sale of receivables based on the dollar
value of the receivables sold. Such fees are immaterial and are included in Foreign currency and other gain loss, net in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In fiscal 2004, the Companys
European operations sold $45million of its trade receivables to a
factoring company. Such sale of receivables has been accounted for on a basis
consistent with the methodology described in the preceding paragraphs.

million at December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively.
Management believes that the reserves are adequate to provide for losses in the
normal course of business. 67 POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued

The significant decrease in
construction in progress during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was due to
the completion during fiscal 2006 of capital expansion projects under construction
at December31, 2005, including the construction of new spunmelt
manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China and Mooresville, North Carolina as
well as the installation of additional capacity in Nanhai, China.

As further described in Note 10 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements the Company, as of the Effective Date, recorded goodwill
related to the allocation of the reorganization value to the underlying assets
and liabilities based on their estimated fair values on such date and, in
periods subsequent to the Effective Date, have reduced such goodwill as a result
of the recognition of tax benefits resulting from the utilization of net
operating losses for which a valuation allowance was established as of the
Effective Date. During fiscal 2006, the Company recognized additional tax
benefits from the utilization of preconfirmation net operating loss
carryforwards; and completed the Internal Revenue Service IRS examinations
for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, effectively settling certain tax uncertainties with
respect to those years and; based on the findings of the IRS examination, the
Company modified its basis study, as it related to its investment in
subsidiaries. Accordingly, in accordance with SOP 90-7,  68  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued the Company has recognized the
tax benefits with respect to such items in the amount of approximately $274
million, first, to eliminate goodwill of $102 million and; second, to
eliminate all remaining intangibles established as of the Effective Date,
including proprietary technology and other intangibles, in the amount of $131
million; with the excess of such tax benefits over the amounts allocable to
goodwill and other intangible assets, in the amount of approximately $41
million, as a credit to Additional Paid-in Capital.
In connection with the refinancing of the Companys
then outstanding Bank Facility in November2005, a portion of the
unamortized loan acquisition costs associated with the April2004
refinancing were written-off, in the amount of $30 million, and expensed in
the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, $10million of
third-party costs incurred in connection with the 2005 refinancing were also
charged to expense. The Company also incurred $27 million of new loan
acquisition costs related to the issuance of the Credit Facility, consisting
primarily of bank fees, which have been capitalized, and which, together with
$59 million of remaining unamortized fees incurred as part of the
April2004 refinancing, will be amortized over the term of the remaining debt.
In conjunction with the refinancing in April2004
of the then-outstanding Restructured Credit Facility, the Company charged the
unamortized balance of the loan acquisition costs of $50million related
to that debt to the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Concurrently, with
the issuance of the Senior Secured Bank Facility, the Company capitalized
approximately $121million of related loan acquisition costs, which were
primarily bank arrangement and legal fees.

Credit Facility
The Companys Credit Facility the Credit Facility,
which was entered into on November22, 2005 and amended as of December8,
2006, consists of a $450million secured revolving credit facility and a
$4100million first-lien term loan. The proceeds therefrom were used to
fully repay indebtedness under the Companys previous bank facility and pay
related fees and expenses.
All borrowings under the Credit Facility are U.S.
dollar denominated and are guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each
and all of the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company. The
Credit Facility and the related guarantees are secured by ia lien on
substantially all of the assets of the Company, its domestic subsidiaries and
certain of its non-domestic subsidiaries, iia pledge of all or a
portion of the stock of the domestic subsidiaries of the Company and of certain
non-domestic subsidiaries of the Company, and iiia pledge of certain
secured intercompany notes. Commitment fees under the Credit Facility are equal
to 050% of the daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment. The
Credit Facility limits restricted payments to $50million, including cash
dividends, in the aggregate since the effective date of the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains covenants and events of default customary for
financings of this type, including leverage and interest expense coverage
covenants. The Company was in compliance with the debt covenants  70  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued under the current Credit
Facility at December30, 2006 and expects to remain in compliance through
fiscal 2007.
The first-lien term loan
requires mandatory payments of approximately $10million per quarter and
requires the Company to apply a percentage of proceeds from excess cash flows,
as defined by the Credit Facility and determined based on year-end results, to
reduce its then outstanding balances under the Credit Facility. Excess cash
flows required to be applied to the repayment of the Credit Facility are
generally calculated as 500% of the net amount of the Companys available cash
generated from operations adjusted for the cash effects of interest, taxes,
capital expenditures, changes in working capital and certain other items. Since
the amounts of excess cash flows to be applied to the repayment of debt in
future periods are based on year-end results and not currently determinable,
only the mandatory payments of approximately $10million per quarter have
been classified as a current liability. Additionally, no excess cash flow
payment was required to be made with respect to fiscal 2006 due to the
magnitude of the major capital expenditure projects. The Company currently
estimates that the excess cash flow payment with respect to fiscal 2007, which
would be payable in March 2008, is expected to be in the range of
$100million to $250million.
The interest rate applicable
to borrowings under the Credit Facility is based on three-month London
Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a specified margin. The applicable margin
for borrowings under both the first-lien term loan and the revolving credit
facility is 225 basis points. The Company may, from time to time, elect to use
an alternate base rate for its borrowings under the revolving credit facility
based on the banks base rate plus a margin of 75 to 125 basis points based on
the Companys total leverage ratio. There were no outstanding borrowings under
the revolving credit facility as of December30, 2006 or December31,
2005. As of December30, 2006, capacity under the revolving credit
facility had been reserved for outstanding letters of credit in the amount of
$129million, as described below. Average daily borrowings under the
revolving credit facility, which were largely LIBOR-based borrowings, for the
period from January1, 2006 to December30, 2006 were
$176million at an average rate of 785%. Average daily borrowings under
the revolving credit facility, which were largely alternate base rate
borrowings, for the period from November22, 2005 to December31,
2005 were $104million at an average rate of 837%. In addition, the
Company had average daily borrowings under a revolving credit facility related
to previous debt arrangements of $87 million for the period from January2,
2005 to November21, 2005 at an average rate of 823%. The revolving
credit portion of the Credit Facility matures on November22, 2010.
In accordance with the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Company maintained its position in a cash flow
hedge originally entered into in May2004. This cash flow hedge agreement
effectively converts $2125million of notional principal amount of debt
from a variable LIBOR rate to a fixed LIBOR rate of 3383%. The cash flow hedge
agreement terminates on May8, 2007 and is described more fully in
Note14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, in February2007,
the Company entered another cash flow hedge agreement, which is effective May8,
2007, matures June29, 2009 and effectively converts $2400 million of
notional principal amount of debt from a variable LIBOR rate to a fixed LIBOR
rate of 5085%.
Subject to certain terms and
conditions, a maximum of $250million of the Credit Facility may be used
for letters of credit. As of December30, 2006, the Company had
$129million of standby and documentary letters of credit outstanding
under the Credit Facility. Letters of credit are in place to provide added
assurance for certain raw material vendors and administrative service
providers. None of these letters of credit had been drawn on at December30,
2006. 71 POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Subsidiary Indebtedness
Nanhai Nanxin Non-woven Co., Ltd. Nanhai has a
short-term credit facility denominated in U.S. dollars and Chinese renminbi
with a financial institution in China. The amount of outstanding indebtedness
under the facility, collateralized through the pledge of the Nanhai assets, was
$50million at December31, 2005 at an average annual rate of
approximately 444%. The facility was renewed during 2006, but had no
outstanding borrowings as of December30, 2006. Additionally, in fiscal
2006, the Companys operations in China have also entered into other short-term
credit facilities denominated in Chinese renminbi with financial institutions
in China. These short-term credit facilities are intended to finance working capital
requirements. These facilities have an outstanding indebtedness of $46 million
at December30, 2006 and mature at various dates through June2007.
All of these short-term borrowings in China are included in Short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In March2006, one of the
Companys wholly-owned Canadian subsidiaries entered into a term loan totaling
approximately $06million with an agency of the Canadian government,
which agency focuses on generating capital investment in the country. The
principal of the term loan is due September1, 2008. Provided that the
term loan is repaid on September1, 2008, no interest is due. However, if
the Company elects not to pay the loan on September1, 2008, the Company,
subsequent to that date, will begin making monthly payments of principal and
interest at 625% per year.

Provision has been made for U.S. and additional
foreign taxes for the anticipated repatriation of earnings of certain foreign
subsidiaries of the Company. The Company considers the undistributed earnings
of its foreign subsidiaries above the amount already provided to be
indefinitely reinvested. These additional foreign earnings could become subject
to additional tax if remitted, or deemed remitted, as a dividend. However the
determination of the additional amount of tax that would be incurred is not
practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical
calculation. At December30, 2006, the unremitted earnings of its foreign
subsidiaries for which U.S. taxes have not  72  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued been provided amounted to
approximately $231 million. Also, in the event of additional tax, unrecognized
tax credits may be available to reduce some portion of any U.S. income tax
liability.
Management judgment is required in determining tax
provisions and evaluating tax positions. Although management believes its tax
positions and related provisions reflected in the Consolidated Financial
Statements are fully supportable, it recognizes that these tax positions and
related provisions may be challenged by various tax authorities. These tax
positions and related provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are
adjusted as additional facts and information become available, including
progress on tax audits, changes in interpretations of tax laws, developments in
case law and closing of statute of limitations. The Companys tax provision
includes the impact of recording reserves and any changes thereto. As of
December30, 2006, the Company has a number of tax audits in process and open
tax years with various taxing jurisdictions that range from 1998 to 2006.
Although the results of current tax audits and reviews related to open tax
years have not been finalized, management believes that the ultimate outcomes
will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

The Companys financial reorganization, through the

As a result, future tax deductions related to certain built-in deductions and
losses will be limited by Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code, as
amended Section382 during the five-year period following the
ownership change the recognition period. The Company had substantial amounts of
such built-in deductions and losses primarily depreciation deductions

A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the
weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all,
of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of
the deferred tax assets depends on the ability of the Company to generate
sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the future and in the
appropriate taxing jurisdictions. In assessing the realizability of the
deferred tax assets, management considers, among other factors, the trend of
historical and projected future taxable income with appropriate consideration
given to the fact that the Company is less than four years removed from the
Chapter 11 process, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the
carryforward period for net operating losses and tax credits as well as tax
planning strategies available to the Company. After consideration of all the
evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined that valuation
allowances of $1174 million and $985million are appropriate as of
December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively.
During fiscal 2006, the Company: arecognized
additional tax benefits from the utilization of preconfirmation net operating loss
carryforwards; bcompleted the Internal Revenue Service IRS
examinations for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, effectively settling certain tax
uncertainties with respect to those years; and cmodified the tax basis
of its investment in subsidiaries as a result of completing the IRS examination.
In accordance with SOP 90-7, the Company has recognized the tax benefits
with respect to such items which were originally estimated as of the Effective
Date, in the amount of approximately $274 million, first eliminating goodwill
of $102 million; second, eliminating all remaining intangibles established as
of the Effective Date of $131 million; with the excess of such tax benefits
over the amounts allocable to goodwill and other intangibles as a credit to Additional Paid-in Capital
of $41 million. 75  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued There were no significant income tax refunds
receivable at December30, 2006 and $16 million at December31,
2005. These amounts are included in Other
current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Note11. Pension
and Postretirement Benefit Plans
In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No158,
which required employers to recognize the funded status of defined benefit
plans and other postretirement benefit plans in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets, with changes in the plans funded status recognized as a component of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. SFAS No158 has been applied by
the Company as of December30, 2006.
The
Company and its subsidiaries sponsor multiple defined benefit plans and other
postretirement benefit plans that cover certain employees. Benefits are
primarily based on years of service and the employees compensation. It is the
Companys policy to fund such plans in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations. The benefit obligations and related assets under these plans with
respect to the 2006 and 2005 disclosures have been measured as of December30,
2006 and December31, 2005, respectively.

As
discussed below, in fiscal 2007 the Company will recognize approximately $45million
of unamortized losses in its Consolidated Statement of Operations associated
with the partial settlement of a Canadian defined benefit pension plan. The
assumed annual composite rate of increase in the per capita cost of Company
provided health care benefits are reflected in the following table

A one-percentage point increase in the assumed health
care cost trend rate would have increased aggregate service and interest cost
in 2006 by $01million and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December30, 2006 by $04million. A one-percentage
point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have decreased
aggregate service and interest cost in 2006 by $01million and the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December30, 2006 by
$03million.
The plan sponsor selects the expected long-term
rate-of-return on assets assumption in consultation with their investment
advisors and actuary. This rate is intended to reflect the average rate of
earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested to
provide plan benefits. Historical performance is reviewed, especially with
respect to real rates of return net of inflation, for the major asset classes
held or anticipated to be held by the trust, and for the trust itself. Undue
weight is not given to recent experience, that may not continue over the
measurement period, with higher significance placed on current forecasts of
future long-term economic conditions.
Because assets are held in a qualified trust,
anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes. Further, solely for this
purpose, the plans are assumed to continue in force and not terminate during
the period during which assets are invested. However, consideration is given to
the potential impact of current and future investment policy, cash flow into
and out of the trust, and expenses both investment and non-investment
typically paid from plan assets to the extent such expenses are not explicitly
estimated within periodic cost.
The plans
weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows

The trust funds are sufficiently diversified to
maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing return,
with an overall targeted asset allocation of 40%-55% fixed income debt
securities, 40%-55% equity securities and the remainder in cash or cash
equivalents. The Investment  80  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Managers select investment fund
managers with demonstrated experience and expertise, and funds with
demonstrated historical performance, for the implementation of the Plans
investment strategy. The Investment Managers will consider both actively and
passively managed investment strategies and will allocate funds across the
asset classes to develop an efficient investment structure.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to administer
the investments of the Trust within reasonable costs. These costs include, but
are not limited to, management and custodial fees, consulting fees, transaction
costs and other administrative costs chargeable to the Trust.
The Companys practice is to
fund amounts for its qualified pension plans at least sufficient to meet the
minimum requirements set forth in applicable employee benefit laws and local
tax laws. Liabilities for amounts in excess of these funding levels are
included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Employer contributions to its
pension plans in 2007 are expected to approximate $60million.
Expected Benefit
Payments
The following table reflects the total benefits
projected to be paid from the plans, or from the Companys general assets,

In December2004, the Company approved amendments
to various postretirement benefit plans which curtailed or eliminated defined
benefits previously available under the plans. The amendments as adopted will
eliminate, by January1, 2008, the postretirement benefit plans for all
U.S. current retirees of the Company and substantially all U.S. active
employees. The three-year phase-out period was granted to provide current
retirees and other eligible employees an acceptable period to transition to
other alternative medical plans. In accordance with SFAS No106,
Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions as
amended, the gain on the plan curtailments was recognized upon the adoption of
the plan amendments. The gain of $36million was reported as a component
of Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses
in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal year 2004 in the amounts
of $33million and $03million, respectively.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, as part of
its restructuring and related cost reduction measures, the Company negotiated
certain changes with the union representing the employees of one of the
Companys Canadian operations, including a partial curtailment of a defined
benefit pension plan. No net gain or loss has been incurred as a result of the
partial curtailment. However, based on elections made by plan participants
during the second quarter of fiscal 2006, and as approved by Canadian
regulatory authorities on January16, 2007, the Company will incur a
settlement loss associated with employees who have elected to exit the plan.
The loss incurred as a  81  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued result of the partial
settlement of the defined benefit pension plan, in the amount of $45 million,
will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 commensurate with
governmental approval of the terms of the settlement and upon fulfillment by
the Company of its funding requirements in the amount of $19 million
associated with the approved settlement, which funding obligations were
fulfilled in February2007.
The Company sponsors several
defined contribution plans through its domestic subsidiaries covering employees
who meet certain service requirements. The Company makes contributions to the
plans based upon a percentage of the employees contribution in the case of its
401kplans or upon a percentage of the employees salary or hourly wages
in the case of its noncontributory money purchase plans. The cost of the plans
was $25 million, $23million and $19million for fiscal 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.
Note12.Stock
Option and Restricted Stock Plans
Stock Option Plans
The 2003 Stock Option Plan the 2003 Option Plan
was approved by the Companys Board of Directors and shareholders and is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The stock
options, representing 400,000 shares, have a five-year life and vest, based on
the achievement of various service and financial performance criteria, over a
four-year period, with the initial awards beginning their vesting terms as of January4,
2004. Vesting of the stock options is accelerated on the occurrence of a change
in control. As of December30, 2006 and December31, 2005, the
Company had awarded non-qualified stock options to purchase 310,500 and
400,000shares of the Companys ClassA Common Stock, respectively.
Accordingly, at December30, 2006, there remain 89,500 stock options
available to be awarded pursuant to the 2003 Option Plan.
Effective January1, 2006, the Company has
elected to account for the 2003 Option
Plan in accordance with the methodology defined in SFAS No123R,
using the modified prospective transition method. Under the modified
prospective transition method, the compensation costs related to all new grants
and any unvested portion of prior awards are measured based on the grant-date
fair value of the award. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company elected to account
for the 2003 Option Plan in accordance with the intrinsic value method as
prescribed by APB No25. For fiscal 2006, no compensation costs were
recognized for awards under the 2003 Option Plan with performance-based vesting
as the performance targets were not achieved, whereas such targets were
achieved in fiscal years 2005 and 2004. The compensation costs related to the
2003 Option Plan were $02 million, $22million and $06million
during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Had the compensation expense
methodology defined in SFAS No123Rbeen applied for all periods
presented, the Companys net earnings and earnings per common share for fiscal
years 2005 and 2004 would have been impacted as summarized in the discussion of
the Companys stock-based compensation accounting policy in Note2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 82  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued The

Expected volatility is based primarily on historical
volatility. Historical volatility was computed using daily price observations
for the period subsequent to the Effective Date. The Company believes this
method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of the
volatility over the expected life of its options. The Company has no reason to
believe future volatility over the expected life of these options is likely to
differ materially from historical volatility. The weighted-average expected
life is based on the mandatory exercise provisions contained in the 2003 Option
Plan. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury security rate
estimated for the expected life of the options at the date of grant.
SFAS No123Rrequires
the estimation of forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and that
the estimate of forfeiture be adjusted over the requisite service period should
actual forfeitures differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures
are recognized through a cumulative adjustment, which is recognized in the
period of change and which impacts the amount of unamortized compensation
expense to be recognized in future periods.
Restricted Stock Plans
The Companys shareholders approved the 2004
Restricted Stock Plan for Directors the 2004 Restricted Plan, which expires
in 2014, for the issuance of restricted shares of the Companys ClassA
Common Stock to Directors of the Company, as defined in the 2004 Restricted
Plan. The 2004 Restricted Plan approved for issuance 200,000 restricted shares
and is administered by a  83  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued committee of the Companys
Board of Directors not eligible to receive restricted shares under the 2004
Restricted Plan. In fiscal 2006 and 2005, the Company awarded 9,313 and 3,240
restricted shares, respectively, to members of the Companys Board of Directors
for their Board service to the Company. In addition, 12,500 restricted shares
were approved for issuance by the Companys Board of Directors in September2006
to the Companys Chairman of the Board as a component of his compensation for
serving as interim Chief Executive Officer. The cost associated with these
restricted stock grants, which vest over periods ranging from immediately to
eighteen months, totaled approximately $05 million and $01 million for fiscal
years 2006 and 2005, respectively, and was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December30,2006,
132,307shares of the Companys ClassA Common Stock are available to
be awarded under the 2004 Restricted Plan.
The Companys 2005 Employee
Restricted Stock Plan the 2005 Stock Plan was approved by the Companys
Board of Directors and shareholders and is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Companys Board of Directors. The 2005 Stock Plan, which
expires in 2015, approved for issuance 482,000 restricted shares to employees
of the Company. The Compensation Committee may, from time to time, award up to
384,000 shares of restricted stock under the 2005 Stock Plan to such employees
and in such amounts and with specified restrictions as it determines
appropriate in the circumstances. The award of shares of restricted stock by
the Compensation Committee in excess of the 384,000 shares will also require
the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company. Vesting of the
restricted shares is accelerated on the occurrence of a change in control.
During fiscal 2006, 291,500 restricted shares were awarded to certain employees
of the Company. Approximately 108,500 of these shares vested immediately with
the balance vesting 25% on each of the grants anniversary dates, beginning
with January20, 2006 and/or annually based on service and the achievement
of certain performance targets. In addition, 47,688 shares have been
surrendered during fiscal 2006 by employees to satisfy withholding requirements
and 25,144 shares have been forfeited. The compensation cost of
$42million related to these restricted stock grants for fiscal 2006 was
included in Selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As of December30, 2006, 263,332shares of the Companys ClassA
Common Stock are available to be awarded under the 2005 Stock Plan.
Note13.SeriesA
Convertible Pay-in-kind Preferred Shares
In conjunction with the Companys refinancing in April2004
of the Restructured Credit Facility, the Companys majority shareholder
exchanged approximately $426million in aggregate principal amount of
100% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2007 the Junior Notes it
controlled for 42,633shares of the Companys PIK Preferred Shares. Also,
during the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $101million in aggregate
principal amount of the Companys Junior Notes were exchanged for
10,083shares of the Companys PIK Preferred Shares and 6,719shares
of the Companys ClassA Common Stock. Such Junior Notes were subordinated
indebtedness of the Company and provided for interest at an annual rate of
100%, which interest, at the option of the holder, could be received in
additional principal amounts of the Junior Notes or in cash. The Junior Notes
could be converted, at the option of the holder, into shares of ClassA
Common Stock on the same terms as included in the PIK Preferred Shares a
conversion rate of 13714286shares of ClassA Common Stock per share
of the convertible security, which approximates an initial conversion price of
approximately $729 per share. As the aforementioned exchanges were a
component of the recapitalization of the Company, involving the majority
shareholder and other common shareholders of the Company and the  84  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued exchange by the majority
shareholder was a requirement of the then new Bank Facility, the exchanges have
been accounted for as a capital transaction and, accordingly, no gain or loss
was recognized.
Dividends on the PIK Preferred Shares accrued at an
annual rate of 160% and were payable semi-annually in arrears on each January1
and July1, commencing with July1, 2004. Such dividends were payable
at the option of the Company; ithrough the issuance of additional
shares of PIK Preferred Stock; iiin cash; or iiiin a
combination thereof. Accordingly, the Company accrued dividends at the stated
rate of 160% until such time as the form of the dividend was declared by the
Companys Board of Directors. If the dividend was paid-in-kind through the
issuance of additional shares of PIK Preferred Stock, the Company recognized
the dividend at the estimated fair value of the shares issued in excess of the
amounts previously accrued. At any time prior to June30, 2012, the
holders of the PIK Preferred Shares could have elected to convert any or all of
their PIK Preferred Shares into shares of the Companys ClassA Common
Stock at an initial conversion rate of 13714286shares of ClassA
Common Stock per share of PIK Preferred Shares which approximates an initial
conversion price equal to $729 per share.
On January14, 2005, the Companys Board of
Directors declared that dividends accrued on the PIK Preferred Shares from the
date of issuance through December31, 2004, in the amount of
$56million, would be paid in the form of PIK Preferred Shares. The
Company recorded the value of the additional PIK Preferred Shares declared as a
dividend on January14, 2005, the date the Board of Directors declared
that the accrued dividends were to be paid in the form of additional PIK
Preferred Shares, rather than cash, reduced by the amount of dividends
previously recorded at the stated 160% rate. Using the estimated market value
of the Companys ClassA Common Stock of $1850 per share, the fair value
of the 5,540 additional PIK Preferred Shares issued in lieu of cash payment was
approximately $141million, which exceeded the amount previously accrued
by the Company of $56million, based on the stated rate of 160%, by
approximately $85million. On August3, 2005, the Companys Board of
Directors declared that dividends accrued on the PIK Preferred Shares from January1,
2005 through June30, 2005, in the amount of $47million, would be
paid in the form of PIK Preferred Shares. The Company recorded the value of the
additional PIK Preferred Shares declared as a dividend on August3, 2005,
the date the Board of Directors declared that the accrued dividends were to be
paid in the form of additional PIK Preferred Shares, rather than cash, reduced
by the amount of dividends previously recorded at the stated 160% rate. Using
the estimated market value of the Companys ClassA Common Stock of $2770
per share, the fair value of the 4,660 additional PIK Preferred Shares issued
in lieu of cash payment was approximately $177million, which exceeded
the amount previously accrued by the Company of $47million, based on the
stated rate of 160%, by approximately $130million. In addition, the
Company accrued a charge for dividends of $18million for the period from
July2, 2005 through the date that the PIK Preferred Shares were redeemed
for, or converted to, shares of the Companys ClassA Common Stock, as
described below. Accordingly, total accrued and paid-in-kind dividends amounted
to $280million and $56million in fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Also, on July28, 2005, the Companys Board of
Directors authorized the redemption of all of the Companys PIK Preferred
Shares on or before September30, 2005. On August16, 2005, the Board
of Directors set September15, 2005 as the redemption date the Redemption
Date. In accordance with the terms of the PIK Preferred Shares, the Company
would redeem all PIK Preferred Shares outstanding at the Redemption Date at a
redemption rate of 3726397shares of ClassA Common Stock per PIK
Preferred Share. At any time prior to the Redemption Date, holders of PIK
Preferred  85  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Shares could exercise their
right to convert their PIK Preferred Shares into shares of ClassA Common
Stock at a conversion rate of 13714286shares of ClassA Common
Stock per PIK Preferred Share.
As of the close of business on
the Redemption Date, five PIK Preferred Shares had been redeemed by the Company
with the redemption price being paid by the issuance of 187shares of ClassA
Common Stock. Additionally, 62,916 PIK Preferred Shares had been converted by
holders into 8,628,473shares of ClassA Common Stock. Also, during
the first quarter of fiscal 2005, five PIK Preferred Shares were converted into
686shares of ClassA Common Stock. As a result of these
transactions, 8,629,346 additional shares of ClassA Common Stock are now
issued and outstanding and no PIK Preferred Shares are currently issued or
outstanding.
Note14.Derivatives
and Other Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to
manage market risks and reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed
under clearly defined policies and procedures, which prohibit the use of
financial instruments for trading purposes.
The Company uses interest-rate derivative instruments
to manage its exposure related to movements in interest rates with respect to
its debt instruments. As indicated in Note9 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, to mitigate its interest rate exposure as required by the Credit
Facility, the Company entered into a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest
rate swap, thus effectively converting the variable LIBOR-based interest
payments associated with $2125million of the debt to fixed amounts at a
LIBOR rate of 3383%. The notional amount of this contract, which expires on May8,
2007, was $2125million. Cash settlements are made quarterly and the
floating rate is reset quarterly, coinciding with the reset dates of the
current Credit Facility.
In accordance with SFAS No133, the Company
designated the swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of interest
payments and applied the shortcut method of assessing effectiveness. The
agreements terms ensure complete effectiveness in offsetting the variability
of the interest component associated with $2125million of first-lien
term loan debt. As such, there is no ineffectiveness and changes in the fair
value of the swap are included in Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair
value of the interest rate swap, based on current settlement values, was $15
million and $38million as of December30, 2006 and December31,
2005, respectively. Those amounts were included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The impact of this swap on Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations was a decrease of $37 million for fiscal year 2006 and an increase
of $02million and $24million for fiscal years 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Additionally, on February8, 2007, the Company
entered into a similar pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap contract
to become effective on May8, 2007. The notional principal amount of this
new contract, which expires on June29, 2009, is $2400 million and
effectively fixes the LIBOR interest rate on that amount of debt at 5085%.
During fiscal years 2006 and
2005, the Company used foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its
U.S.-dollar exposure on Euro-based obligations for firm commitments. At December31,
2005, the Company had approximately $301million of notional amount in
outstanding contracts with a third party financial institution. There were no
outstanding contracts at December30, 2006. 86  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Note15.Shareholders

In June2006, one of the Companys subsidiaries, Fabpro Oriented
Polymers,Inc. Fabpro entered an agreement relating to the sale of
certain assets for $23million and a supply and marketing rights
agreement supply agreement with an unrelated third party. Under the terms
of the supply agreement, which has an initial term of 10 years, Fabpro has
committed to purchase a minimum level of product as defined in the supply
agreement, representing approximately $71 million per year, based on current
sales prices, through the year 2012. In the event that Fabpro does not purchase

Collective Bargaining
Agreements
At December30, 2006, the
Company had approximately 3,471 employees worldwide. Approximately 1,314
employees are represented by labor unions or trade councils, which have entered
into separate collective bargaining agreements with the Company. Approximately
25% of the Companys labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements

Environmental
The Company is subject to a
broad range of federal, foreign, state and local laws and regulations relating
to pollution and protection of the environment. The Company believes that it is
currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements
and does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its operations,
financial or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with
environmental requirements.
Litigation
The Company is not currently a
party to any material pending legal proceedings other than routine litigation
incidental to the business of the Company. During fiscal 2005, the Company was
served with a lawsuit by a customer alleging breach of contract and other
charges. The discovery phase is continuing and there is not currently enough
information to formulate an assessment of the ultimate outcome of the claim.
Accordingly, management is not able to estimate the amount of the loss, if any,
at this time. The Company intends to vigorously defend this action and believes
that it has reasonable arguments available in its defense. However, there is a
possibility that resolution of this matter, or others that may arise in the
normal course of business, could result in a loss in excess of established
reserves, if any. 91  POLYMER GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Note19.Quarterly

Managements Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company
as such term is defined in Rule13a-15fof the Exchange Act.
Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes
those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; iiprovide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures of
the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the
Companys management and directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Under the direction of our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management has assessed
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December30, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the
criteria set forth in the Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this assessment, management concluded that
the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December30,
2006. Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued its report on managements assessment of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting which is included herein. 94 Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the
Companys internal control over financial reporting in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
Polymer Group,Inc.
We have audited managements assessment, included in
the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that Polymer Group,Inc. a Delaware corporation and
subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO. Polymer Group,Inc.s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Polymer
Group,Inc. and subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by COSO. Also in our opinion, Polymer Group,Inc. and
