REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Renaissance Worldwide, Inc.
In our opinion, based upon our audits and the reports of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 8
on page 24 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Renaissance Worldwide, Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company at June 28,
1997, December 27, 1997 and December 26, 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
June 28, 1997, for the six months ended December 27, 1997, and for the year
ended December 26, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the results of operations of
Renaissance Solutions, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, for the year ended
December 31, 1996, which are included in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended June 29, 1996. We also did not
audit the financial statements of Neoglyphics Media Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary, as of December 31, 1997 and for the year ended December 31,
1997, which statements are included in the accompanying balance sheet as of
June 28, 1997 and December 27, 1997 and in the accompanying consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended June 28, 1997. We also did not
audit the financial statements of Triad Data, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary,
as of December 31, 1997 and for each of the two years in the period ended
December 31, 1997, which statements are included in the accompanying balance
sheet as of June 28, 1997 and December 27, 1997 and in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations for the years ended June 29, 1996 and
June 28, 1997, respectively. In the aggregate, these statements reflect total
assets of $17,787,000, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
June 28, 1997 and December 27, 1997, and total revenues of $74,454,000 and
$61,575,000 in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the
years ended June 29, 1996 and June 28, 1997, respectively. Those statements
were audited by other auditors whose reports thereon have been furnished to
us, and our opinion expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts
included for Renaissance Solutions, Inc., Neoglyphics Media Corporation and
Triad Data, Inc. for these periods is based solely on the reports of the other
auditors. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of other auditors
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Renaissance
Worldwide, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. On November 26, 1996,
November 27, 1996, July 31, 1997, and November 26, 1997, the Company completed
the acquisitions of Application Resources, Inc. ARI, Shamrock Computer
Resources, Ltd. SCR, Renaissance Solutions, Inc. RSI, and The Hunter
Group, Inc. Hunter, respectively. On December 31, 1996, RSI completed the
acquisition of International Systems Services Corporation ISS. On March
31, 1998 and April 2, 1998, the Company completed the acquisitions of
Neoglyphics Media Corporation Neoglyphics and Triad Data, Inc. Triad,
respectively. These transactions have been accounted for as poolings-of-
interests and, therefore, the accompanying financial statements have been
retroactively restated to reflect the financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of each of these entities with the Company for all
periods presented see Note 3. In addition, the accompanying financial
statements include the accounts of several entities acquired in purchase
transactions, subsequent to their respective acquisition dates see Note 4,
as well as the accounts of a real estate trust the Trust which is
substantially controlled by the Company, subsequent to the renegotiation of
certain lease terms on September 19, 1995 see Note 16. All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Fiscal Year
Effective with the period ended December 27, 1997, the Company changed its
fiscal year from the last Saturday in June to the last Saturday in December.
RSI, ARI and SCR previously utilized a December 31 year end. Upon acquisition,
RSI, ARI and SCR changed their fiscal year ends to the last Saturday in June
to conform to the Company previous fiscal year. Hunter, Neoglyphics, and
Triad previously utilized a December 31 year end. Upon acquisition, Hunter,
Neoglyphics, and Triad changed their fiscal year ends to the last Saturday in
December to conform to the Company fiscal year see Note 3.
The six month period ended December 27, 1997 the Transition Period
reflects the results of operations and cash flows for the six months then
ended for the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The results of operations
and of cash flows for the years ended June 29, 1996, June 28, 1997, and
December 26, 1998 are for 53 weeks, 52 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively.
The unaudited results of operations for the six month period ended December
28, 1996 included revenues of $214,774,000, cost of revenues of $150,052,000,
selling, general and administrative expenses including acquisition-related
expenses of $58,862,000, income from operations of $5,860,000, income before
taxes of

RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
$7,689,000 and net income of $1,654,000. Earnings per share-basic for the
period was $003. Earnings per share-diluted for the period was $003. In the
opinion of management, the above unaudited amounts include all adjustments,
consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly
the Company consolidated results of operations for the six months ended
December 28, 1996.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
Company cash equivalents consist primarily of short term federal notes and
money market securities bearing interest at a weighted average rate of
approximately 45% at December 26, 1998. The investments are carried at cost
plus accrued interest, which approximates market value. The Company considers
such securities to be classified as available-for-sale under Statements of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities.
Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue is primarily comprised of fees for consulting
services. The majority of the Company revenue is from contracts on a time
and materials basis and is recognized as the services are performed. The
remainder of the Company contracts are on a fixed-price basis, and revenue
from those contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method
based upon the number of labor hours incurred compared to the total estimated
hours at estimated realizable rates. Under the percentage of completion
method, the Company must estimate the percentage of completion of each project
at the end of each financial reporting period. Estimates are subject to
adjustment as a project progresses to reflect changes in projected completion
costs or dates. Revenues are reported net of reimbursable expenses which are
typically billed and collected from clients. Losses, if any, are provided for
in the period in which the loss is determined. Amounts received in excess of
revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue.
Accounts Receivable, Concentration of Credit Risk and Uncertainties
The Company is subject to credit risk through trade receivables. Credit risk
with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by the diversification of the
Company operations, as well as its large client base and its geographical
dispersion. The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its receivables and
may obtain retainers at the onset of significant fixed price client
engagements. Collateral is not required for time and material contracts. In
management opinion, the Company has provided sufficient provisions to
prevent a significant impact of credit losses to the financial statements. The
failure of the Company to complete a fixed price project to the client
satisfaction within the fixed price exposes the Company to potentially
unrecoverable cost overruns.
Fees on fixed-price contracts are generally billable to clients upon the
achievement of specified milestones. Unbilled revenue was $5,174,000 7,913,000, and $23,073,000, at June 28, 1997, December 27, 1997, and December
26, 1998 respectively.
No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues or more than 10%
of accounts receivable for any period presented.

In March 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Position No. 98-1, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use
SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1998. The Company existing accounting policies conform with the
requirements of this statement. The Company has capitalized $36 million in
1998 in relation to the Peoplesoft implementation. These costs primarily
include licensing fees and internal labor costs of employees directly
associated with the implementation project.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are recorded as expense when incurred.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes, as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. SFAS No. 109 requires the recognition
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, utilizing currently enacted tax rates. The
effect of any future change in tax rates is recognized in the period in which
the change occurs.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries had previously elected to be treated
as small business corporations for income tax purposes with income or loss and
credits passed through to the stockholders. These elections were subsequently
terminated prior to or upon acquisition by the Company and the net deferred
tax asset or liability as of the date of acquisition has been included in the
provision for income taxes in the period of termination.
Certain of the Company subsidiaries had previously utilized the cash
method of accounting for income taxes. Upon acquisition by the Company, these
subsidiaries converted to the accrual method of accounting for income taxes.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for employee awards under its stock plans in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees and related interpretations. The Company adopted SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation for disclosure purposes only See
Note 12.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
40
RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
disclosure of contingencies at June 28, 1997, December 27, 1997, and December
26, 1998 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the two years
in the period ended June 28, 1997, the six month period ended December 27,
1997 and the year ended December 26, 1998. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
As described in Note 4, the Company amortizes goodwill and intangible assets
arising from purchase acquisitions on a straight-line basis over a period of
10 to 30 years. Goodwill is evaluated for consideration of potential
impairment based on the operating results and forecasted cash flows of the
acquired entity.
Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Segment Reporting
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131 Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS No. 131 superseded SFAS No. 14,
Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise, redefining the
segments to be those used by management for making operating decisions and
assessing performance. SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products
and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of SFAS No.
131 did not affect the results of operations or financial position but did
affect the disclosure of segment information see Note 18.
Other Comprehensive Income
In the first quarter of 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income. This statement requires disclosure of comprehensive
income and its components in interim and annual reports. Comprehensive income
includes all changes in stockholders' equity during a period except those
resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders.
Accordingly, the components of comprehensive income include net income,
cumulative translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities. Deferred taxes have not been provided on
cumulative translation adjustments because deferred taxes have not been
provided on unremitted earnings see Note 10. Deferred taxes and any
reclassification adjustments related to unrealized gains/losses on investments
are insignificant.
Translation of Foreign Currencies
The functional currency of the Company subsidiaries is the local currency.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S.
dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date; income and
expense items and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the
period. Cumulative net translation adjustments are included in stockholders'
equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions, not
significant in amount, are included in the results of operations as other
income expense.
Net Income Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. SFAS No. 128 specifies modifications to
the Renaissance Worldwide, Inc. calculation of earnings per share from that
previously used by the Company. Under SFAS No. 128, earnings per share-basic
is calculated based upon the weighted average number of common shares actually
outstanding, and earnings per share-diluted is calculated based upon the
weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common stock
outstanding. Potential common stock includes stock options and warrants,
calculated using the
41

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
treasury stock method, and the assumed conversion of ARI preferred stock
see Note 11. However, potential common stock has been excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December
27, 1997 and the year ended December 26, 1998, as its effect would be anti-
dilutive.
A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
is as follows:

business and a $57 million charge for the write-down of goodwill and other
assets associated with the Company Technomics business, both recorded in the

functional realignments made by the Company, a decision was made to dispose of
these non-performing Strategy business units. No proceeds are anticipated from
the discontinuance of these business units.
Net restructuring and other asset write-downs also included $90 related to
a restructuring plan designed to focus the Company on the new corporate
strategy and eliminate redundant facilities and personnel recorded in the

approximately 50 employees, primarily in certain business initiatives the
Company decided to exit, and amounts owed under recruiting contracts for
positions which were eliminated.

utilized, primarily through cash disbursements funded from operations or the
use of additional borrowings in 1999.

1997, December 31, 1996 and April 2, 1998, RSI, America Registry, SCR,
Neoglyphics, ISS and Triad, respectively, had each elected to be an S
Corporation for federal income tax purposes as provided in Section 1362a of
the Internal Revenue Code. As such, the corporate income or loss and credits
were passed through to the stockholders and reported on their personal tax
returns.
RSI election to be treated as an S Corporation terminated effective with
the closing of RSI initial public offering. The cumulative effect of the
temporary differences between financial accounting and income tax reporting
was not material.
Neoglyphics elected to terminate its S Corporation status on January 1,
1997. At the time of this conversion, a net deferred tax liability of $302,000
was recorded through the income tax provision on January 1, 1997. This
deferred tax liability was comprised principally of the effects of Neoglyphics
being a cash basis tax payer.
America Registry, SCR, ISS and Triad elections to be treated as S
Corporations terminated in conjunction with the acquisition of all of the
common stock of America Registry, SCR, ISS and Triad by the Company. As a
result, the income or loss of America Registry commencing on January 1,
1996, the income or loss of SCR commencing on November 27, 1996, the income or
loss of ISS commencing on December 31, 1996 and the income or loss of Triad
commencing on April 2, 1998 is subject to corporate income tax, and is
included in the income tax provision benefit described below.
At the time of conversion of America Registry from an S Corporation to a C
Corporation, a net deferred tax liability of $642,000 was recorded through the
income tax provision on January 1, 1996. This deferred tax liability was
comprised principally of the remaining effects of America Registry
converting from the cash basis to the accrual basis for tax reporting purposes
on January 1, 1994, offset by deferred tax assets for certain accrued expenses
which are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting.
At the time of the conversion of SCR from an S Corporation to a C
Corporation, a net deferred tax asset of $403,000 was recorded through the
income tax provision on November 27, 1996. The deferred tax asset was
comprised principally of certain accrued expenses and allowances which are
recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting.
At the time of conversion of ISS from an S Corporation to a C Corporation, a
net deferred tax liability of $1,002,000 was recorded through the income tax
provision on December 31, 1996. This deferred tax liability was comprised
principally of the effect of converting from the cash basis to the accrual
basis for tax reporting purposes.
At the time of conversion of Triad from an S Corporation to a C Corporation,
a net deferred tax liability of $2,878,000 was recorded through the income tax
provision on April 2, 1998. This deferred tax liability was comprised

basis for tax reporting purposes.

From its inception, Hunter reported its financial results for income tax
purposes using the cash method of accounting. Upon acquisition by Renaissance,
Hunter changed its method of accounting for income tax reporting purposes from
the cash method to the accrual method. As a result, substantially all of the
deferred tax liability related to Hunter accumulated on the balance sheet will
become due and payable over a four-year period.

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences
between the amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. Under SFAS 109, the
benefit associated with future deductible temporary differences and operating
loss or credit carryforwards is recognized if it is more likely than not that
a benefit will be realized. Deferred tax expense benefit represents the
change in the net deferred tax asset or liability balance. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are comprised of the following at June 28, 1997, December 27,

Undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregated
approximately $23 million on December 26, 1998, which under existing law,
will not be subject to U.S. tax until distributed as dividends. Since the
earnings have been or are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign
operations, no provision has been made for any U.S. taxes that may be
applicable thereto. Furthermore, any taxes paid to foreign governments on
those earnings may be used in whole or in part as credits against the U.S. tax
on any dividends distributed from such earnings. It is not practicable to
estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these undistributed
earnings.

Employee Stock Option Plans
The Company currently has seven employee stock options plans, four of which
were assumed upon the acquisitions of ARI, RSI, Hunter and Neoglyphics and one
created to authorize grants of options to the Company international
employees. They are as follows:
1996 Stock Plan
This plan, adopted in March 1996, authorizes the grant of incentive stock
options, non-qualified stock options, stock purchase authorizations or stock
bonus awards to key employees, including officers, employee directors and
consultants.
56
RENAISSANCE WORLDWIDE, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
As of December 27, 1997, the total number of shares of Common Stock
authorized under the 1996 Plan was 7,200,000. In May of 1998, the shareholders
approved an amendment to the 1996 Stock Plan increasing the number of shares
of common stock available for awards under the Plan. The amendment provided
that for a three-year period, the shares available under the Plan will be
increased each year by a number of shares equal to 4% of the total outstanding
shares at the beginning of each year. For 1998, that increase was equal to 4%
of the shares outstanding on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders
55,796,624 shares resulting in 2,231,864 additional shares authorized.
Incentive stock options cannot be granted to consultants. For incentive
options, the purchase price is equal to the fair market value on the date of
grant 110% of fair market value for stockholders who hold greater than 10% of
Renaissance stock at the time of grant. For non-qualified options and stock
purchase authorizations, the purchase price is determined by the Board of
Directors within limits as set forth in the plan, but shall not be less than
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of grant. The periods
over which options are exercisable are determined by the Board of Directors.
If permitted by the Board of Directors, employees may use previously acquired
shares of Renaissance common stock provided that such shares tendered have
been held for at least six months or may borrow money from Renaissance on a
recourse basis for a period of time not to exceed five years to pay the
exercise price of shares purchased. Options may expire up to ten years after
the date of grant five years for incentive options granted to 10%
stockholders. The Board of Directors has the discretion to designate non-
qualified options as transferable. The plan will terminate in March 2006.
1995 RSI Equity Incentive Plan
In January 1995, RSI Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders
approved the 1995 Equity Incentive Plan the RSI Equity Plan. Under the
terms of the RSI Equity Plan, the Company is authorized to make awards of
restricted stock and to grant incentive and non-statutory options to employees
of, and consultants and advisors to the Company to purchase shares of the
common stock of the Company. A total of 3,360,000 shares of common stock may
be issued upon exercise of options granted or awards made under the RSI Equity
Plan. Options granted through December 27, 1997 generally vest in either four
or five equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the
optionee date of hire.
SCR Option
On April 1, 1993, SCR granted a non-qualifying stock option to a key
employee to purchase 96,286 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$000365 per share. The option had a nine-year vesting period, subject to
acceleration for certain events such as the sale, merger or liquidation of
SCR, or an initial public offering, and an expiration date of April 1, 2002.
Compensation expense of $281,000, which represented the excess of the
estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant over the exercise
price, was being recognized over the nine-year vesting period. The
unrecognized portion of the compensation expense was recorded as a reduction
of stockholders' equity in the accompanying balance sheet. Effective November
27, 1996, the stock option was exercised in accordance with the acceleration
clause of the option agreement in connection with the acquisition of SCR by
the Company see Note 3 and the remaining unamortized balance of deferred
stock compensation of $164,000 was recorded as expense at that time.
1994 ARI Stock Plan
In 1994, ARI adopted the 1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 ARI Plan, under
which 823,284 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance to eligible
employees, directors and consultants upon the exercise of stock options. ARI
also had outstanding options to purchase 14,818 shares of common stock and
27,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock which were granted prior to the
adoption of the 1994 ARI Plan. Stock options were granted at prices determined
by ARI former Board of Directors and generally may not be less than 100% and
85%, for incentive and nonstatutory options, respectively, of the estimated
fair value of the related shares on the
57

date of grant. Options granted under the 1994 ARI Plan are for a period not to
exceed ten years, are exercisable beginning generally one year after the date
of grant and vest ratably over a maximum period of five years following the
date of grant.
ARI also had options outstanding to purchase 27,000 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding at June 24, 1995 and June 29, 1996. On November
26, 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of ARI by the Company, all
options to purchase Series A Preferred Stock were converted into options to
purchase 14,818 shares of common stock.
All stock options granted to ARI former management employees fully vested
in the event of a change of control, as defined by the ARI Board of Directors.
This change of control occurred upon acquisition of ARI by the Company in
November of 1996. Since that date, all options outstanding were exercised.
There are no outstanding options in the 1994 ARI Plan at December 26, 1998.
Renaissance does not intend to grant any further options under the 1994 ARI
Plan.
1991 Hunter Employee Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
In 1991, Hunter adopted the 1991 Employee Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
the Hunter Employee Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan to provide long term
performance incentives to Hunter employees. All options granted are non-
qualified options. The Hunter Board of Directors determines the option price,
which may be different than the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of option grant. Hunter has reserved 1,990,860 shares for issuance under
the Hunter Employee Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan. Options vest and expire
as determined at the grant date by the Hunter Board of Directors, provided
that no options may be exercised later than ten years after the grant of the
option.
A former officer of Hunter exercised options to purchase 18,913 shares of
common stock in October 1996. Upon ceasing employment, Hunter promised to pay
this individual $113,000 instead of issuing shares. This promise was evidenced
in January 1997 by a $113,000 non-interest bearing note see Note 9. The
amount of the note, which is included as compensation expense, was based on
Hunter estimate of the fair market value of the underlying stock at the time
of his exercise.
1996 Neoglyphics Stock Option Plan
In 1996, Neoglyphics adopted a stock option plan that provides for incentive
stock options for key employees and nonqualified stock options for key
individuals, including nonemployees. Neoglyphics had reserved 224,910 shares
for issuance under the stock option plan.
1998 Acquisition Plan
In April 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Acquisition Plan for
use exclusively for non-qualified options to be awarded to employees of
acquired businesses. This plan has the same term and vesting provisions of the
1996 Stock Plan. A total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized
for issuance under the Plan.

1998 International Plan
In April 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 International Plan
for use exclusively for non-qualified options to be awarded to employees in
foreign jurisdictions. This plan has the same term and vesting provisions of
the 1996 Stock Plan. A total of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock were
authorized for issuance under the Plan.
Option repricing
In December 1998 the Company offered employees the opportunity to reprice
their stock options at the current fair market value of the Company common
stock on December 15, 1998, the repricing date. Employees electing to take
advantage of this repricing program agreed to a two for one exchange of their
options and to a one year holding period. In connection with the repricing,
the Company repriced 6,079,000 of existing options with a weighted average
exercise price of $2160. This plan was completed on December 15, 1998.

Shares Reserved for Future Issuance
A total of 18,214,591 shares of Renaissance Common Stock has been reserved
for issuance under Renaissance various stock plans at December 26, 1998.
Directors Stock Plans
1996 Eligible Directors' Stock Plan
This plan authorizes the grant of an option to purchase 40,000 shares of
common stock to each non-employee director on the date of the director
initial election to the Board of Directors. The exercise price of options
granted is 100% of the closing price per share of common stock on the date of
grant. Directors may use previously acquired shares of Renaissance common
stock to pay the exercise price of shares purchased provided that such shares
tendered have been held for at least six months. An aggregate of 200,000
shares of common stock may be issued under the plan. Options are exercisable
in four equal annual installments, commencing on the first anniversary date of
the grant. Options expire ten years after the date of grant. The plan will
terminate in March 2006.
In April and May 1996, options to purchase 40,000 shares each of common
stock at an exercise price of $550 and $650 per share, respectively, were
granted to newly-elected directors.
1995 RSI Director Stock Option Plan
In January 1995, the RSI Board of Directors adopted and the RSI stockholders
approved the 1995 Director Stock Option Plan the RSI Director Plan, which
became effective on the closing of RSI initial public offering. Under the
terms of the RSI Director Plan, the directors of RSI who were not employees of
the Company were eligible to receive non-statutory options to purchase shares
of common stock. A total of 80,000 shares of common stock may be issued upon
exercise of options granted under the RSI Director Plan. Options to purchase
40,000 shares of Common Stock have been granted to the two eligible directors.
The exercise price of options granted under the RSI Director Plan was equal to
the closing price of the common stock on the date of grant.
1998 Directors Stock Plan
In May of 1998, the stockholders of the Company approved the 1998 Directors
Stock Option Plan the 1998 Directors Plan that replaced the existing 1996
Eligible Directors' Stock Plan. Under the 1998 Directors Plan, outside
directors of the Company will receive equity compensation in three ways. Upon
joining the Board, an outside director will receive an option covering 20,000
shares of Common Stock. This option will become exercisable in four annual
installments beginning one year after grant. Outside directors will also
receive an option covering 2,500 shares of common stock after each year of
service. This award, which represents compensation for service during the
previous year, will be immediately exercisable. Each director will be required
to take one-half on the annual retainer currently $12,000 in options having
an equivalent value and may elect to take all or a portion of the balance in
options as well. Two outside directors, who had served two years without
annual equity awards, were each granted immediately exercisable options
covering 5,000 shares.
Stock Purchase Plans
1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
This plan, which is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal
Revenue Code, authorizes the grant of options to eligible employees on a semi-
annual basis to purchase shares of Renaissance common stock. For the June
1996, January 1997, and July 1997 offerings, the plan permitted eligible
employees to purchase up to 400 shares of common stock in any six month
offering period through the accumulation of payroll deductions,
60

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
which may not exceed 10% of the employee compensation. For the June 1996,
January 1997 and July 1997 offerings, employees were eligible to participate
if they have been employed by Renaissance for at least eighteen months.
Commencing with the January 1998 offering, employees are eligible to
participate upon employment by Renaissance. Shares are purchased at 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of Renaissance common stock at the beginning
or end of each six month offering period. Employees may end their
participation in the offering at any time during the offering period, and
participation ends automatically on termination of employment. The first stock
offering period under the plan commenced on June 5, 1996, the effective date
of the registration statement covering Renaissance initial public offering.
56,178, 46,510 and 259,514 shares of Common Stock were issued under this plan
during the year ended June 28, 1997, the six month period ended December 27,
1997 and the year ended December 26, 1998, respectively, at issuance prices of
$723, $1955, and $1878 respectively. In May 1998, the shareholders approved
an amendment to the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan changing the maximum
number of shares to be purchased by eligible employees in any six month
offering period to 200 shares and amending the termination provisions of an
employee under the plan. In addition, greater flexibility in choosing which
subsidiaries will participate in the Plan was granted in consideration of some
of the subsidiaries in foreign countries. The plan will terminate in March
2006.
1995 RSI Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In January 1995, RSI Board of Directors adopted and the shareholders
approved the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan the RSI Purchase Plan,
which became effective on the closing of RSI initial public offering. The
RSI Purchase Plan authorizes the issuance of up to a total 720,000 shares of
common stock to participating employees. Under the terms of the RSI Purchase
Plan, the purchase price is an amount equal to 85% of the fair market value
per share of the common stock on either the first day or the last day of the
offering period, whichever is lower. 67,429 shares, 55,296 shares and 27,160
shares were issued under the RSI Purchase Plan during the years ended June 29,
1996, June 28, 1997 and the six months ended December 27, 1997 at a weighted
average price of $916, $1321, and $2457, respectively. The weighted average
fair value of the 1996, 1997, and December 1997 awards under the RSI Purchase
Plan were $161, $477, and $1179 per share, respectively. Commencing in
January of 1998, the Company terminated the RSI Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Accounting Treatment
Renaissance applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
Interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. Compensation is
recognized for the difference between the exercise price of options granted
and the estimated fair value of the related shares on the date of grant, and
is recorded over the vesting period. Amortization of compensation expense
totaled $31,000, $494,000, $750,000, and $0 in the years ended June 29, 1996
and June 28, 1997, and in the six months ended December 27, 1997 and in the
year ended December 26, 1998, respectively. The benefit of tax deductions
associated with the exercise of non-qualified stock options in excess of the
amount of compensation recorded for financial reporting purposes is recorded
as a credit to additional paid-in capital.
In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFAS No. 123 is effective for periods beginning after December
15, 1995. SFAS No. 123 requires that companies either recognize compensation
expense for grants of stock options and other equity instruments based on fair
value, or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in
the notes to the financial statements. Renaissance adopted the disclosure
provisions only of SFAS No. 123. Had compensation cost of Renaissance stock-
based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant
dates as calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 123, Renaissance net income
and earnings per share for the years ended June 29,

Because options vest over several years and this pro forma disclosure only
reflects grants made in the last three fiscal periods, the effects of applying
SFAS No. 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not likely to be representative
of the effects on reported net income for future years.
The fair market value of each stock option granted during the year ended
June 29, 1996 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions: an expected life of 3-4 years, expected volatility
of 0% for Hunter and Renaissance pre IPO periods and 62% for RSI, a dividend
yield of 0% and risk-free interest rates of 58 to 64%. The fair market value
of each stock option granted during the year ended June 28, 1997 was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:
an expected life of 3-5 years, expected volatility of 43% to 62%, a dividend
yield of 0% and risk-free interest rates of 63%. The fair market value of
each stock option granted during the six months ended December 27, 1997 was
estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: an expected life of 525 years, expected
volatility of 45%, a dividend yield of 0% and risk-free interest rates of
62%. The fair market value of each stock option granted during the year ended
December 26, 1998 was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions: an expected life of 550
years, expected volatility of 79%, a dividend yield of 0% and risk-free
interest rates of 60%.
The fair market value of offerings under the Renaissance stock purchase plan
was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions: an expected life of 5
years, expected volatility of 435%, a dividend yield of 0%, and risk-free
interest rates of 6% in the fiscal years ended June 29, 1996, June 28, 1997
and the six months ended December 27, 1997.
The fair market value of offerings under the RSI stock purchase plan was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
with the following weighted average assumptions: an expected life of 5 years,
expected volatility of 62% in fiscal 1996, fiscal 1997, and the six months
ended December 27, 1997, a dividend yield of 0% for all periods, and risk-free
interest rates of 563% in fiscal 1996, 527% in fiscal 1997 and 60% in the
six months ended December 27, 1997. The fair market value of offerings under
the Renaissance stock purchase plan was estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: an expected life of 5 years, expected volatility of 55%, a
dividend yield of 0% and risk-free interest rates of 6% for the year ended
December 26, 1998.
The fair market value of offerings under the Neoglyphics Stock Option Plan
was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions: an expected life of 1 to 7 years,
expected volatility of 001%, a risk-free interst rate of 60% and no dividend
yield.

13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Operating Leases
Renaissance occupies premises under various noncancelable operating leases
which include terms requiring Renaissance to pay a pro-rata portion of
increased operating expenses and real estate taxes. The leases expire on
various dates through April 2018, and certain of the leases contain options
for renewal or purchase of related equipment.
In January 1993, Renaissance entered into a three year lease with a real
estate trust of which the president and significant shareholder of Renaissance
is the sole beneficiary the Trust, which required annual rental payments
of $120,000, payable in equal monthly installments of $10,000. This lease
continued to be amended upon subsequent expansions of the leased area and
currently requires annual payments of $531,000 payable in equal monthly
installments of $44,000. The amended lease term is September 2010. In
conjunction with the amendment of the lease in September 1995, Renaissance
began to consolidate the accounts of the Trust on a prospective basis see

14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Renaissance provides employee retirement savings plans under Section 401k
of the Internal Revenue Code which cover substantially all employees. Under
the terms of the plans, employees may contribute a percentage of their salary
up to a maximum of 10%-20% which is then invested in one or more of several
mutual funds selected by the employee. Renaissance may make contributions to
the Renaissance plan at its discretion; such contributions totaled $563,000 605,000, $472,000, and $2,984,000 for the years ended June 29, 1996, and June
28, 1997, the six months ended December 27, 1997 and the year ended December
26, 1998, respectively.
15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Renaissance enters into various types of financial instruments in the normal
course of business. Fair values are estimated based on assumptions concerning
the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount
rates reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk. Accordingly, the fair
values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could
have been realized as of year end or that will be realized in the future.
The carrying amounts of Renaissance financial instruments, which include
marketable securities see Note 5, accounts receivable, notes receivable,
line of credit, accounts payable, accrued salaries and wages, other accrued
expenses, income taxes payable and long-term debt approximate their fair
values at June 28, 1997, December 27, 1997, and December 26, 1998.
16. CONSOLIDATION OF REAL ESTATE TRUST
As described in Note 13, Renaissance leases office space from the Trust, of
which the president and significant stockholder of Renaissance is the sole
beneficiary and an officer of Renaissance is the trustee. Effective September
19, 1995, Renaissance renegotiated its lease with the Trust in conjunction
with a refinancing of the Trust mortgage. The modified lease terms expanded
the amount of space which Renaissance occupies, committed Renaissance to rent
the facility through the maturity date of the mortgage loan, and granted
Renaissance a right of first refusal to lease any space in the facility
currently occupied by other tenants when the tenants' leases expire.
Accordingly, as of this date, Renaissance obtained significant control over
the operations of the Trust and assumed a significant portion of the Trust
obligations. As a result, Renaissance has consolidated the accounts of the
Trust as of September 19, 1995 on a prospective basis. As of September 19,
1995, the Trust reported the following assets and liabilities in thousands:
Fixed assets,  $ 1,750
Other current    49
Security deposits and deferred    84
Notes payable to   365
Mortgage loans  1,461
