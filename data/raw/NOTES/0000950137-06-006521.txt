Financial Statements and Supplementary Data REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders QLogic Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
QLogic Corporation and subsidiaries as of April2, 2006 and
April3, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
April2, 2006. In connection with our audits of the
consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the
financial statement schedule of valuation and qualifying
accounts as listed in the index under a2. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of QLogic Corporation and subsidiaries as of
April2, 2006 and April3, 2005, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended April2, 2006, in conformity
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of QLogic Corporations internal control over
financial reporting as of April2, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated June1, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Costa Mesa, California June1, 2006 36 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders QLogic Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A, that
QLogic Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of April2, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. QLogic
Corporations management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that QLogic
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of April2, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, QLogic Corporation maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of April2, 2006, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of QLogic Corporation and
subsidiaries as of April2, 2006 and April3, 2005,
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
April2, 2006, and our report dated June1, 2006,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. s/ KPMG LLP Costa Mesa, California June1, 2006 37 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS April2, 2006 and April3, 2005

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   
General Business Information QLogic Corporation QLogic or the Company designs and develops
storage network infrastructure components including host bus
adapters HBAs, Fibre Channel blade switches, Fibre Channel
stackable switches and other fabric switches that provide the
connectivity infrastructure for storage networks. The Company
also designs and develops enclosure management and baseboard
management products. The Company markets and distributes its
products through a direct sales organization supported by field
application engineers, as well as through a network of
independent manufacturers representatives and regional and
international distributors. The Companys primary original
equipment manufacturer OEMcustomers are major domestic
and international suppliers and manufacturers of servers and
workstations.   
Principles of Consolidation and Financial Reporting
Period The consolidated financial statements include the financial
statements of QLogic Corporation and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company maintains a fifty-two/fifty-three week fiscal year
ending on the Sunday nearest March31. Fiscal years 2006
and 2004 each comprised fifty-two weeks and ended on
April2, 2006 and March28, 2004, respectively. Fiscal
year 2005 was comprised of fifty-three weeks and ended on
April3, 2005.   
Basis of Presentation In November 2005, the Company completed the sale of its hard
disk drive controller and tape drive controller business the
Business. The Business meets all of the criteria in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, to be presented as discontinued operations. As a
result of the divestiture of the Business, the Companys
consolidated financial statements for all periods present the
operations of the Business separate from continuing operations.
See Note2 Acquisitions and Dispositions. In March 2006, the Company completed a two-for-one stock split
through the payment of a stock dividend to the holders of record
of the Companys common stock on February16, 2006. As
a result, share numbers and per share amounts for all periods
presented in the consolidated financial statements reflect the
effects of this stock split. Certain other reclassifications have been made to prior year
amounts to conform to the current year presentation.   
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates that affect the
amounts reported in the Companys consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Among the significant
estimates affecting the consolidated financial statements are
those related to revenue recognition, inventory and income
taxes. The actual results experienced by the Company could
differ materially from managements estimates.   
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the
following fundamental criteria are met: ipersuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, iidelivery has
occurred, iiithe price to the customer is fixed or
determinable and ivcollection of the resulting accounts
receivable is reasonably assured. 42 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued For all sales, the Company uses a binding purchase order or a
signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement. Delivery occurs
when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to
the customer, in accordance with the terms specified in the
arrangement with the customer. The customers obligation to
pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and
are not dependent on the subsequent resale of the Companys
product. However, certain of the Companys sales are made
to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right
to return unsold product and price protection provisions. The
Company recognizes revenue from these distributors when the
product is sold by the distributor to a third party. At times,
the Company provides standard incentive programs to its
distributor customers and accounts for such programs in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue
No01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendors
Products. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its
competitive pricing incentives, which generally reflect
front-end price adjustments, as a reduction of revenue at the
time of sale, and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the
period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific
program criteria and historical experience. Royalty and service
revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably
assured. For those sales that include multiple deliverables, the Company
allocates revenue based on the relative fair values of the
individual components as determined in accordance with EITF
Issue No00-21,
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
When more than one element, such as hardware and services, are
contained in a single arrangement, the Company allocates revenue
between the elements based on each elements relative fair
value, provided that each element meets the criteria for
treatment as a separate unit of accounting. An item is
considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the
customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and
reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items.
Fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged
when the element is sold separately. In the absence of fair
value for a delivered element, the Company allocates revenue
first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and
allocates the residual revenue to the delivered elements. In the
absence of fair value for an undelivered element, the
arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting,
resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered
elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled.   
Research and Development Research and development costs, including costs related to the
development of new products and process technology, as well as
purchased in-process technology, are expensed as incurred.   
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not
to be realized.   
Net Income per Share The Company computes basic net income per share based on the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
periods presented. Diluted net income per share is computed
based on the weighted-average number of common and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding using the treasury stock
method during the periods presented. The Company has granted
certain stock options and warrants which have been treated as
dilutive potential common shares in computing diluted net income
per share. 43 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash equivalents, investments in marketable securities and trade
accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained
with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks
may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.
Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are
maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and
therefore have minimal credit risk. The Company invests its
marketable securities primarily in government securities,
corporate bonds and municipal bonds, all of which are high
investment grade. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure through diversification and investment in highly
rated securities. Sales to customers are denominated in
U.S.dollars. As a result, the Company believes its foreign
currency risk is minimal. The Company sells its products to OEMs and distributors
throughout the world. As of April2, 2006 and April3,
2005, the Company had four customers which individually
accounted for 10% or more of the Companys accounts
receivable. These customers, all of which were OEMs of servers
and workstations, accounted for an aggregate of 65% and 64% of
the Companys accounts receivable at April2, 2006 and
April3, 2005, respectively. The Company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers financial condition
and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers.   
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
with original maturities of three months or less on their
acquisition date to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts of
cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values.   
Marketable Securities and Investments The Companys marketable securities are invested primarily
in debt securities, including government securities, corporate
bonds and municipal bonds. As of April2, 2006, the Company
also holds shares of common stock in a publicly traded company
which were received in connection with the sale of its hard disk
drive controller and tape drive controller business. All of the
Companys marketable securities are classified as available
for sale and are recorded at fair value, based on quoted market
prices. The Companys available-for-sale marketable
securities are included in short-term investments in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and
losses, net of related income taxes, are excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive
income loss until realized. Realized gains or losses and
other-than-temporary declines in fair value are determined on a
specific identification basis and reported in interest and other
income, net as incurred. The Company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in
the fair value of an investment below the cost basis is judged
to be other-than-temporary. The Company considers various
factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment
charge, including the financial condition and near term
prospects of the investee, the magnitude of the unrealized loss
compared to the cost of the investment, the length of time the
investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the
Companys ability to hold the investment for a period of
time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market
value.   
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do
not bear interest. Amounts collected on accounts receivable are
included in net cash provided by operating activities in the
accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. An allowance
for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to
make required payments. This reserve is determined by analyzing
specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to
the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances. 44 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
first-in, first-out
or market.   
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful
lives of 395years for buildings, five to fifteen years
for building and land improvements, and two to five years for
other property and equipment. Leasehold improvements are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease
term or the estimated useful life of the related asset.   
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with SFASNo142 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFASNo142 requires that
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives
not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for
impairment, or more frequently when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired, by
comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting
unit to which they are assigned. The Company considers the
Company as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of
testing for impairment. For goodwill, a two-step test is used to identify the potential
impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment, if
any. The first step is to compare the fair value of the
reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If
the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill is considered not impaired; otherwise, goodwill
is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two.
Under step two, the impairment loss is measured by comparing the
implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying
amount of goodwill. The Company performs the annual test for impairment as of the
first day of its fiscal fourth quarter and utilizes the two-step
process. During the annual goodwill impairment test in
fiscal2006, the Company completed step one and determined
that there was no impairment of goodwill since the fair value
based on quoted market price of the reporting unit exceeded
its carrying value. Other intangible assets consist primarily of technology acquired
or licensed from third parties, including technology acquired in
business acquisitions. Other intangible assets that have
definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three
to six years. Amortization expense related to technology
acquired or licensed from third parties is included in cost of
revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.   
Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFASNo144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying
amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows
expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell.   
Warranty The Companys products typically carry a warranty for
periods of up to five years. The Company records a liability for
product warranty obligations in the period the related revenue
is recorded based on historical 45 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued warranty experience. Warranty expense and the corresponding
liability are not material to the consolidated financial
statements.   
Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity other than
transactions with stockholders. The Companys accumulated
other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains
losses on available-for-sale securities, net of income taxes.   
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries that operate
where the functional currency is the local currency are
translated to U.S.dollars at exchange rates in effect at
the balance sheet date with the resulting translation
adjustments recorded as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive
income related to translation adjustments was not material for
all periods presented. Income and expense accounts are
translated at average exchange rates during the period. Gains
and losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency are included in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income and were not
material for all periods presented.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for its employee stock-based compensation
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
APBNo25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations, and has adopted
the disclosure only alternative of SFASNo123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended.
APBNo25 provides that compensation expense relative
to the Companys stock-based employee compensation plans
including shares to be issued under the Companys stock
option and employee stock purchase plans, collectively the
Stock-Based Awards is measured based on the
intrinsic value of stock options granted and the Company
recognizes compensation expense in its consolidated statements
of income using the straight-line method over the vesting period
for fixed awards. The Company does not recognize compensation
expense on stock issued to employees under its employee stock
purchase plan as the discount from market value is not material.
Under SFASNo123, the fair value of the Stock-Based
Awards at the date of grant is recognized in earnings over the
vesting period. 46 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The following table shows pro forma net income as if the fair

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use
in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting
restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions, including expected stock price volatility. The
Stock-Based Awards have characteristics significantly different
than those of traded options and changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the estimate of their value. On March13, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the
Companys Board of Directors approved the acceleration of
vesting of certain unvested and
out-of-the-money
stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than
$2400per share previously awarded to its officers and
employees. Options granted to non-employee directors were not
accelerated. As a result of the acceleration, a total of 1,221,000
outstanding unvested options became immediately exercisable. The
accelerated options have per share exercise prices ranging from
$2419 to $2787 and a weighted-average exercise price
of$2498. The accelerated options would otherwise have
vested from time to time over the next two years. All other
terms and conditions applicable to the accelerated stock option
grants, including the exercise price and number of shares, were
unchanged. As discussed above, the Company accounts for its
employee stock-based compensation in accordance withAPB
No25. Under APB No25, the acceleration did not
result in recognition of stock-based compensation expense
because the exercise price for 47 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued all stock options subject to the acceleration was in excess of
the then current market price of the Companys common stock. The primary purpose of the acceleration was to enable the
Company to avoid recognizing non-cash compensation expense
associated with these options in future periods in its
consolidated financial statements, upon adoption of
SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment during
the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Additionally, the Company
believes that these options have limited economic value and
would not provide sufficient retentive value when compared to
the future stock option compensation expense. The Company
estimated that the non-cash compensation expense associated with
these options would have been approximately $94million
over the next two fiscal years if the acceleration had not
occurred. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASBissued SFASNo123R, which supersedes
SFASNo123, APBNo25 and related
interpretations, and amends SFASNo95,
Statement of Cash Flows. The provisions of
SFASNo123R are similar to those of
SFASNo123, however SFASNo123R requires
all share-based payments to employees, including grants of
employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the
date of grant. Fair value of share-based awards will be
determined using option-pricing models e.g. Black-Scholes or
binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the
specific circumstances of the awards. Compensation cost will be
recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of
awards that actually vest. The Company expects to utilize the modified-prospective
transition alternative in adopting SFASNo123R.
Under this method, compensation cost would be recognized in
financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption
for all share-based payments granted, modified or settled after
the date of adoption, as well as for any unvested awards that
were granted prior to the date of adoption. SFASNo123R is effective at the beginning of the
first annual period beginning after June15, 2005 for the
Company, fiscal 2007. The adoption of the
SFASNo123R fair value method will have a
significant adverse impact on the Companys consolidated
statements of income, although it will have no impact on its
overall financial position. The balance of unearned stock-based
compensation to be expensed in fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2010
related to share-based awards unvested at April2, 2006, as
previously calculated under the disclosure-only requirements of
SFASNo123, is approximately $38million. If
there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying
unvested stock-based awards, the Company may be required to
accelerate or adjust any remaining unearned stock-based
compensation expense. To the extent that the Company grants
additional stock-based awards to employees or assumes unvested
stock-based awards in connection with any acquisitions,
stock-based compensation expense will be increased by those
additional grants or acquisitions. The Company anticipates it
will grant additional stock-based awards in fiscal 2007. The
fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above,
as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time
because it will depend on the number of stock-based awards
granted and the then current fair values. Management currently estimates that, had the Company adopted
SFASNo123R in prior periods, the magnitude of the
impact of that standard on the Companys consolidated
statements of income would have approximated the impact of
SFASNo123 as illustrated in the pro forma table
above, assuming the application of the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. SFASNo123R also requires the
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation
cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an
operating cash flow as currently required. This requirement may
reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods after its adoption. While the Company cannot
estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of
operating cash flows recognized in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004
related to such excess tax deductions was $51million 24million and $106million, respectively. 48 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position
FAS115-1/FAS124-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
Application to Certain Investments the FSP. The FSP
provides guidance on determining when investments in certain
debt and equity securities are considered impaired, whether that
impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such
impairment loss. The FSP also includes accounting considerations
subsequent to the recognition of an other-than-temporary
impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
losses that have not been recognized as other-than-temporary
impairments. The FSP is required to be applied to reporting
periods beginning after December15, 2005. The adoption of
the FSP did not have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated balance sheets or statements of income.   
Note2.
Acquisitions and Dispositions   
Sale of Hard Disk Drive Controller and Tape Drive
Controller Business In November 2005, the Company completed the sale of its hard
disk drive controller and tape drive controller business to
Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Marvell for cash and
980,000shares of Marvells common stock. The Company
received $1840million in cash, including a
$40million purchase price adjustment due to inventory
levels on the date of closing, as specified in the agreement.
The number of shares of Marvells common stock received by
the Company was calculated based on $450million, as
specified in the agreement, divided by the average closing price
of Marvell stock for the ten days ending the day before the
closing date. The shares received by the Company were valued at
$470million based upon the market price of the shares
received on the closing date. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2006, the Company sold 525,000shares of the Marvell
stock received in the transaction and recognized a gain of
$85million which is included in interest and other
income, net in the accompanying consolidated statement of
income. The remaining shares are accounted for as
available-for-sale
marketable securities and are included in short-term investments
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at April2,
2006. As specified in the agreement, the assets sold to Marvell
consisted primarily of intellectual property, inventories and
property and equipment. As of April2, 2006, all other
assets and liabilities of the Business have been recovered or
settled by the Company. The agreement also provided for $120million of the
consideration to be placed in escrow with respect to certain
standard representations and warranties made by the Company. The
Company has included the escrowed amount in the calculation of
the gain on sale of the Business due to the Companys
assessment that compliance with the representations and
warranties is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. The
escrowed amount is included in other current assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet at April2, 2006. 49 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Income from discontinued operations consists of direct revenues
and direct expenses of the Business, including cost of revenues,
as well as other fixed and allocated costs to the extent that
such costs were eliminated as a result of the transaction.
General corporate overhead costs have not been allocated to
discontinued operations. A summary of the operating results of

There were no assets or liabilities related to discontinued
operations as of April2, 2006. Assets and liabilities
related to discontinued operations as of April3, 2005
consisted primarily of accounts receivable, inventory, property
and equipment, and accrued compensation.   
Troika Networks In November 2005, the Company completed the purchase of
substantially all of the assets of Troika Networks, Inc.
Troika for $365million in cash and the assumption of
certain liabilities. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase business combination. The assets acquired included
intellectual property including patents and trademarks,
inventory and property and equipment. Troika developed, marketed
and sold a storage services platform that hosted third-party
software solutions. The Company expects the acquisition of
Troika to expand the Companys product line and the
acquired intellectual property to enhance certain of its current
products and provide greater functionality to its customers. The
consideration paid in excess of the fair market value of the
tangible assets acquired totaled $348million. Based on a
preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company has recorded
goodwill of $207million and core technology of
$36million, which are included in goodwill and other
intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
as of April2, 2006, and recognized a charge of
$105million for purchased in-process research and
development IPRD. IPRD was expensed because the
technological feasibility of the product under development had
not been established and no future alternative uses existed. One
IPRD project was identified, which related to the
development of a new product. As of the date of the acquisition,
the project was estimated to be more than 50% complete and is
expected to be completed in fiscal 2007. The fair value of the
IPRD was valued utilizing the income approach which
estimates expected future after-tax cash flows of the project
under development and discounts its net present value at an
appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. The Company has not
yet completed the evaluation of the intangible assets acquired
and expects to finalize the purchase price allocation in fiscal
2007, which may result in adjustments to the amounts recorded in
fiscal 2006. As this acquisition was an asset purchase, the
goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible. The Company also entered into a performance plan with certain
former Troika employees upon employment with QLogic. The
performance plan provides for the issuance of the Companys
common stock based on the achievement of certain performance
milestones and continued employment with QLogic. In connection
with the performance plan, the Company could recognize
compensation expense of up to $65million over four years.
In fiscal 2006, the Company recognized $05million of
expense related to this 50 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued performance plan which is included in operating expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statement of income. The results of operations for the Troika business have been
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date
of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented as the results of the Troika business are not material
in relation to the consolidated financial statements of the
Company.   
Little Mountain Group In January 2001, the Company acquired the outstanding common
stock of Little Mountain Group, Inc. LMGfor cash, stock
and additional consideration related to performance milestones.
The structure of the acquisition, which was accounted for as a
purchase, included the issuance of stock based on performance
milestones to be achieved through fiscal 2005 to certain former
stockholders of LMG who are employees of the Company. The fair
value of the shares issued was charged to engineering and
development expense as the performance milestones were achieved.
During fiscal 2005 and 2004, the Company issued approximately
179,000 and 131,000shares of common stock in connection
with the achievement of the performance milestones. The fair
value of the shares issued was $65million in each of
fiscal 2005 and 2004

from the diluted net income per share calculations because their
exercise prices were greater than the average share price of the
common stock and, therefore, their effect would have been
anti-dilutive. Contingently issuable shares pursuant to the
performance plan associated with the acquisition of Troika have

The gross unrealized losses related to the Companys debt
securities were due to changes in interest rates. Management
reviewed various factors in determining whether to recognize an
impairment charge related to the unrealized losses on the
Companys debt securities, including the financial
condition and near term prospects of the investee, the magnitude
of the unrealized loss compared to the cost of the investment,
the length of time the investment has been in an unrealized loss
position and the Companys ability to hold the investment
for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
recovery of market value. Based on this analysis, the
Companys management has determined that the gross
unrealized losses at April2, 2006 and April3, 2005
are temporary in nature. 53 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

rate of one-sixteenth of one whole Right per one share of common
stock, as adjusted pursuant to the Companys stock splits.
Each share of common stock presently outstanding that had been
issued since June20, 1996 also includes one-sixteenth
Right, and each share of common stock that may be issued after
the date hereof and prior to the Distribution Date as defined
below also will include one-sixteenth Right. The Rights become exercisable ithe 10thbusiness

market value of the common stock at the beginning or end of each
three-month offering period. The ESPP permits an enrolled
employee to make contributions to purchase shares of common
stock by having withheld from their salary an amount between 1%
and 10% of compensation. As of April2, 2006 and
April3, 2005, ESPP participant contributions of
$08million were included in other current liabilities in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The total number
of shares issued under the ESPP was 430,000, 465,000 and 271,000
during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   
Incentive Compensation Plans The Company may grant to employees and directors options to
purchase shares of the Companys common stock under the
QLogic 2005 Performance Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan. Prior to

granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common
stock under the QLogic Corporation Stock Awards Plan the Stock
Awards Plan and the QLogic Corporation Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan the Director Plan, and together with the
Stock Awards Plan and the 2005 Plan, the Stock Option Plans.
Additionally, the Company has issued options on an ad hoc basis
from time to time and has assumed stock options as part of
acquisitions. The Stock Awards Plan and the 2005 Plan provide for the issuance
of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock
and other stock-based incentive awards for officers and
employees. The Stock Awards Plan and the 2005 Plan permit the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to select
eligible employees to receive awards and to determine the terms
and conditions of awards. No shares of restricted stock have
been issued under the Stock Awards Plan or the 2005 Plan. Options granted under the Companys Stock Awards Plan or
the 2005 Plan provide that an employee holding a stock option
may exchange mature stock, which the employee already owns, as
payment against the exercise of an option. This provision
applies to all options outstanding as of April2, 2006. All
stock options granted to employees under the Companys
Stock Awards Plan and the 2005 Plan have ten-year terms and vest
over four years from the date of grant. Under the terms of the 2005 Plan, new directors receive an
option grant, at fair market value, to purchase
50,000shares of common stock of the Company upon election
to the Board. The 2005 Plan provides for annual grants to each
non-employee director other than the Chairman of the Board of
options to purchase 25,000shares of common stock and
annual grants of options to purchase 75,000shares of
common stock to any non-employee Chairman of the Board. All
stock options granted to directors under the Director Plan and

Upon the adoption of the 2005 Plan, no further shares can be
granted under the Stock Awards Plan or Director Plan. In addition, options to purchase9,000 and
45,000shares of common stock were outstanding as of
April2, 2006 and April3, 2005, respectively, for
options granted outside of the Companys Stock Option Plans
in fiscal 1996 and 1997. These options had four-year vesting

Litigation Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
instituted against the Company. The outcome of litigation cannot
be predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims and
proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Many
intellectual property disputes have a risk of injunctive relief
and there can be no assurance that a license will be granted.
Injunctive relief could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. Based on an evaluation of matters which are pending
or asserted, the Company believes the disposition of such
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.   
Indemnifications The Company indemnifies certain of its customers against claims
that products purchased from the Company infringe upon a patent,
copyright, trademark or trade secret of a third party. In the
event of such a claim, the Company agrees to pay all litigation
costs, including attorney fees, and any settlement payments or
damages awarded directly related to the infringement. The
indemnification provisions generally do not expire. The Company
is not currently defending any intellectual property
infringement claims and has not been informed of any pending
infringement claims. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded a
liability related to such indemnifications.

Based upon the Companys current and historical pre-tax
earnings, management believes it is more likely than not that
the Company will realize the benefit of the existing net
deferred tax assets as of April2, 2006. Management
believes the existing net deductible temporary differences will
reverse during periods in which the Company generates net
taxable income or that there would be sufficient tax carry backs
available; however, there can be no assurance that the Company
will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing
earnings in future years. 60 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued As of April2, 2006, the Company has a remaining federal
net operating loss carryforward of approximately
$77million, which will expire in 2020 if not utilized.
The net operating loss carryforward relates to an acquired
company and is subject to limitations on its utilization. As of April2, 2006, the Company has state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $16million. If not
utilized, the state tax credit carryforwards will begin to
expire in 2014. Approximately $03million of the state tax
credits carryforwards relate to an acquired company and are
subject to limitations on their utilization. The Companys Federal consolidated tax return for the 2004
fiscal year is presently under examination by the Internal
Revenue Service. Management does not expect that the results of
this examination will have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

Subsequent Event On April3, 2006, the Company acquired all outstanding
shares of PathScale, Inc. PathScale. PathScale designs and
develops system area network fabric interconnects targeted at
high-performance clustered system environments. The acquisition
of PathScale expands the Companys portfolio of solutions
to include InfiniBand, a high-performance, low-latency, switched
fabric interconnect. Consideration paid for this acquisition was
approximately $110million in cash, which included the
purchase of all vested PathScale stock options. In addition, the
Company converted unvested PathScale stock options for
continuing employees into options to purchase approximately
307,000shares of QLogic common stock with a
weighted-average exercise price of $300. The total fair value
of the converted options is approximately $6million and
will be recognized as compensation expense over the remaining
service period. The Company is in the process of evaluating the net assets
acquired and expects to finalize the purchase price allocation
during fiscal 2007. The consideration paid in excess of the fair
market value of tangible assets acquired is expected to be
allocated to intangible assets, goodwill and IPRD. To the
extent a portion of the purchase price is allocated to
IPRD, the Company will recognize a charge to operating
expenses for such amount. The historical results of operations
of PathScale are not material in relation to the consolidated
financial statements of the Company. The Company also entered into a performance plan with certain
former PathScale shareholders who became employees of QLogic.
The performance plan provides for the issuance of stock based on
the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued
employment with QLogic. In connection with the performance plan,
the Company could recognize compensation expense of up to
$15million over four years. 62 Table of Contents QLOGIC CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Controls and Procedures Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures to
ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief
executive officer and our chief financial officer, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such
term is defined under
Rule13a-15e
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation,
our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of April2, 2006. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined
in Rule13a-15f
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Internal control over
financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control Integrated
Framework. Based on our evaluation, our management concluded
that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of April2, 2006. The independent registered public accounting firm that audited
the consolidated financial statements included in this annual
report has issued an attestation report on managements
assessment of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. See page37 herein. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting, as defined in
Rule13a-15f
promulgated under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information None. PARTIII
