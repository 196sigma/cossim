Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November30, 2015and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November30, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries as of November30, 2015and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January22, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting./s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLPCertified Public AccountantsMiami, FloridaJanuary22, 201675Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSNovember30, 2015and 20142015 12014  per share amountsASSETSLennar Homebuilding:Cash and cash  cash13,5059,849Receivables,  homes and construction in  and land under  inventory not owned58,85152,453Total  in unconsolidated entities741,551656,837Other  Financial    certain provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810, Consolidations, ASC 810 the Company is required to separately disclose on its consolidated balance sheets the assets of consolidated variable interest entities VIEs that are owned by the consolidated VIEs and liabilities of consolidated VIEs as to which there is no recourse against the Company.As of November30, 2015, total assets include $6523 millionrelated to consolidated VIEs of which $96 millionis included in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, $05 millionin Lennar Homebuilding receivables, net, $39 millionin Lennar Homebuilding finished homes and construction in progress, $1542 millionin Lennar Homebuilding land and land under development, $589 millionin Lennar Homebuilding consolidated inventory not owned, $358 millionin Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, $227 millionin Lennar Homebuilding other assets, $3552 millionin Rialto assets and $115 millionin Lennar Multifamily assets.As of November30, 2014, total assets include $9291 millionrelated to consolidated VIEs of which $117 millionis included in Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents, $03 millionin restricted cash, $02 millionin Lennar Homebuilding receivables, net, $02 millionin Lennar Homebuilding finished homes and construction in progress, $2082 millionin Lennar Homebuilding land and land under development, $525 millionin Lennar Homebuilding consolidated inventory not owned, $239 millionin Lennar Homebuilding investments in unconsolidated entities, $1046 millionin Lennar Homebuilding other assets, $5084 millionin Rialto assets and $192 millionin Lennar Multifamily assets.See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements76Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSNovember30, 2015and 20142015 22014  per share amountsLIABILITIES AND EQUITYLennar Homebuilding:Accounts  related to consolidated inventory not owned51,43145,028Senior notes and other debts   Financial  Multifamily66,95052,243Total  equity:Preferred stockClassA common stock of $010 par value per share; Authorized: 2015 and 2014 -

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which Lennar Corporation has a controlling interest and VIEs see Note 15 in which Lennar Corporation is deemed the primary beneficiary the Company. The Companys investments in both unconsolidated entities in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and in VIEs in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary are accounted for by the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Changes in Accounting PrinciplesIn November 2015, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest Subtopic 835-30ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. As a result, as of November30, 2015and 2014the Company reclassified $264 millionand $289 million, respectively, of Lennar Homebuildings debt issuance costs from Lennar Homebuilding other assets to Lennar Homebuilding notes and other debts payable, and $37 millionand $62 million, respectively, of Rialtos debt issuance costs from Rialto assets to Rialto liabilities, in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. In addition, in accordance with ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, the Company determined to continue presenting the debt issuance costs associated with the Company revolving credit facility, letters of credit facilities and warehouse facilities as other assets included within Lennar Homebuilding, Lennar Financial Services and Rialto assets in the Company consolidated balance sheets and continue amortizing those deferred costs over the term of the facilities.Revenue RecognitionRevenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. See Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily within this Note for disclosure of other revenue recognition policies related to those segments.Advertising CostsThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $479 million, $452 millionand $319 millionfor the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, respectively.Share-Based PaymentsThe Company has share-based awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan the Plan, which provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted common stock nonvested shares and other share based awards to officers, associates and directors. The exercise prices of stock options may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than tenyears after the date of the grant. The Company accounts for stock option awards and nonvested share awards granted under the Plan based on the estimated grant date fair value81Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedCash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values. Cash and cash equivalents as of November30, 2015and 2014included $4149 millionand $2632 million, respectively, of cash held in escrow for approximately 3days.Restricted CashLennar Homebuilding restricted cash consists of customer deposits on home sales held in restricted accounts until title transfers to the homebuyer, as required by the state and local governments in which the homes were sold, as well as funds on deposit to secure and support performance obligations. Rialto restricted cash consists of cash held in escrow by the Company loan servicer provider on behalf of customers and lenders and is disbursed in accordance with agreements between transacting parties.InventoriesFinished homes and construction in progress are included within inventories. Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as incurred. Homes held-for-sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas. The Company reviews its inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were 662and 622active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of November30, 2015and 2014, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.In conducting its review for indicators of impairment on a community level, the Company evaluates, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales and the estimated fair value of the land itself. The Company pays particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, the Company identifies communities whose carrying values exceed their undiscounted projected cash flows.The Company estimates the fair value of its communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above. For example, during the downturn in the housing market, the Company found ways to reduce its construction costs in many communities, and this reduction in construction costs in addition to changes in product type in many communities impacted future estimated cash flows.Each of the homebuilding markets in which the Company operates is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of the Companys homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. The Companys projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in the Companys cash flow model are projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis.In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales included in the Companys cash flow model, the Company analyzes its historical absorption pace in the community as well as other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, the Company considers internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing the Companys historical absorption pace for home sales and corresponding internal and external market studies, the Company places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters as well as forecasted population demographics, unemployment rates and availability of competing product. Generally, if the Company notices a variation from historical results over a span of 82Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedtwo fiscal quarters, the Company considers such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjusts its historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace in the cash flow model for a community.In order to determine the assumed sales prices included in its cash flow models, the Company analyzes the historical sales prices realized on homes it delivered in the community and other comparable communities in the geographical area as well as the sales prices included in its current backlog for such communities. In addition, the Company considers internal and external market studies and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics on sales prices in neighboring communities and sales prices on similar products in non-neighboring communities in the geographic area where the community is located. When analyzing its historical sales prices and corresponding market studies, the Company also places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends such as future forecasted sales prices in neighboring communities as well as future forecasted sales prices for similar products in non-neighboring communities. Generally, if the Company notices a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, the Company considers such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjusts its historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected sales prices in the cash flow model for a community.In order to arrive at the Companys assumed costs to build and deliver homes, the Company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Those costs assumed are used in the cash flow model for the Companys communities.Since the estimates and assumptions included in the Companys cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future.Using all available information, the Company calculates its best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each assets fair value depends on the communitys projected life and development stage. The Company generally uses a discount rate of approximately 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory.The Company estimates the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause the Company to re-evaluate its strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and/or additional write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts.As of November30, 2015, the Company reviewed its communities for potential indicators of impairments and identified 13homebuilding communities with 931homesites and a carrying value of $1217 millionas having potential indicators of impairment. Of those communities, the Company recorded valuation adjustments of $81 millionon 209homesites in 5communities with a carrying value of $194 million.As of November30, 2014, the Company reviewed its communities for potential indicators of impairments and identified 26homebuilding communities with 1,774homesites and a carrying value of $1453 millionas having potential indicators of impairment. Of those communities, the Company recorded valuation adjustments of $29 millionon 120homesites in onecommunity with a carrying value of $81 million.The table below summarizes the most significant unobservable inputs used in the Company discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of its communities for which the Company recorded valuation adjustments during the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013:November 30,201520142013Unobservable inputsRangeRangeAverage selling  rate per quarter homes3-16122-34Discount rate12%-20%20%20%83Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Company also has access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until it has determined whether to exercise its option. A majority of the Companys option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. The Companys option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on the fair value at the time of takedown.In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, the Company evaluates the option primarily based upon its expected cash flows from the property under option. If the Company intends to walk away from an option contract, it records a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.The Companys investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case the Companys investments are written down to fair value. The Company reviews option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet the Companys targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause the Company to re-evaluate the likelihood of exercising its land options.Some option contracts contain a predetermined take-down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, the Company is not required to purchase land in accordance with those take-down schedules. In substantially all instances, the Company has the right and ability to not exercise its option and forfeit its deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of its deposit and pre-acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, the Company does not consider the take-down price to be a firm contractual obligation.When the Company does not intend to exercise an option, it writes off any unapplied deposit and pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract. For the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company wrote-off $31 million, $46 millionand $19 million, respectively, of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land under option that it does not intend to purchase.Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesThe Company evaluates the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period generally using a discount rate between 10%and 20%, subject to the perceived risks associated with the communitys cash flow streams relative to its inventory or operating assets. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, the Companys proportionate share is reflected in the Company Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to its Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities. Additionally, the Company evaluates if a decrease in the value of an investment is other-than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management: 1 projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, 2 discount rates applied to the future distributions and 3 various other factors, which include age of the venture, relationships with the other partners and banks, general economic market conditions, land status and liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.The Company tracks its share of cumulative earnings and distributions of its joint ventures JVs. For purposes of classifying distributions received from JVs in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns oncapital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of the Companys share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in the Companys consolidated statements of cash flows as cash from investing activities.Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesGAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: athe power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and bthe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE84Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Companys variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of 1equity ownership, 2contracts to purchase assets, 3 management and development agreements between the Company and a VIE, 4loans provided by the Company to a VIE or other partner and/or 5guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. The Company examines specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIEs executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality, if any, between the Company and the other partners and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary may require it to exercise significant judgment.Generally, all major decision making in the Companys joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by the Company are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between the Company and other partners. Generally, the Company purchases less than a majority of the JVs assets and the purchase prices under its option contracts are believed to be at market.Generally, Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partners lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, the Company continues to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions.Operating Properties and EquipmentOperating properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is thirty years, for furniture, fixtures and equipment is twoto tenyears and for leasehold improvements is fiveyears or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. Operating properties are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indicators that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.Investment SecuritiesInvestment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax, until realized. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity.At both November30, 2015and 2014, the Lennar Homebuilding segment had available-for-sale securities totaling $05 millionincluded in Lennar Homebuilding other assets, which consist primarily of investments in community development district bonds that mature in 2039. Certain of these bonds are in default by the borrower, which may allow the Company to foreclose on the underlying real estate collateral. Unrealized holding gain losses during the years ended November30, 2015and 2014were deferred as a result of the Company continuing involvement in the underlying collateral, thus no gains were recognized during the years ended November30, 2015and 2014.At November30, 2015and 2014, the Lennar Financial Services segment had investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaling $402 millionand $450 million, respectively, which consist mainly of corporate debt obligations, U.S. government agency obligations, certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities that mature at various dates, mainly within five years. Also, at November30, 2015and 2014, the Lennar Financial Services segment had available-for-sale securities totaling $428 millionand $168 million, respectively, which consist primarily of preferred stock and mutual funds. These investments available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. As of November30, 2015and 2014, investments available-for-sale had net cumulative unrealized gains, net of tax, of $39 thousandand $130 thousand, respectively. During the years ended November30, 2015and 2014, the Company recorded unrealized gains losses in other comprehensive income loss, net of tax of $65 thousandand $130 thousand, respectively.In addition, at November30, 2015and 2014, the Rialto segment had investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaling $256 millionand $173 million, respectively. The Rialto segment held-to-maturity securities consist of commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS. At both November30, 2015and 2014, the Company had noinvestment securities classified as trading85Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedInterest and Real Estate TaxesInterest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventory costs while they are being actively developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to the Lennar Financial Services operations is included in its costs and expenses.During the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, interest incurred by the Companys homebuilding operations related to homebuilding debt was $2885 million, $2734 millionand $2615 million, respectively; interest capitalized into inventories was $2761 million, $2369 millionand $1676 million, respectively.Interest expense was included in cost of homes sold, cost of land sold and other interest expense as follows:Years Ended November30,In  expense in cost of homes  expense in cost of land sold2,4933,6172,562Other interest  interest  TaxesThe Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense.A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by the Company based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a more-likely-than-not standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Companys experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.Based on the analysis of positive and negative evidence, the Company believed that there was enough positive evidence for the Company to conclude that it was more likely than not that the Company would realize the majority of its deferred tax assets. As of November30, 2015and 2014, the Company net deferred tax assets included a valuation allowance of $59 millionand $80 million, respectively. See Note 10 for additional information86Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedProduct WarrantyWarranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. The Company regularly monitors the warranty reserve and makes adjustments to its pre-existing warranties in order to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Warranty reserves are included in Lennar Homebuilding other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The activity in the Companys warranty reserve was as follows:November30,In thousands20152014Warranty reserve, beginning of year$115,927102,580Warranties issued81,50560,856Adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates  reserve, end of year$130,853115,9271The adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates during the years ended November30, 2015and 2014primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other  insurable risks such as construction defects, general liability, medical and workers compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Companys self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. The Companys self-insurance reserve as of November30, 2015and 2014was $965 millionand $1032 million, respectively, of which $650 millionand $693 million, respectively, was included in Lennar Financial Services other liabilities in the respective years. Amounts incurred in excess of the Company self-insurance occurrence or aggregate retention limits are covered by insurance up to the Company purchased coverage levels. The Company insurance policies are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom the Company believes counterparty default risk is not significant.Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings of the Company.All outstanding nonvested shares that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents that participate in undistributed earnings with common stock are considered participating securities and are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Companys restricted common stock nonvested shares are considered participating securities.Lennar Financial ServicesRevenue RecognitionTitle premiums on policies issued directly by the Company are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by the Company. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates87Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedLoans Held-for-SaleLoans held-for-sale by the Lennar Financial Services segment, including the rights to service the mortgage loans, are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. At November30, 2015and 2014, loans held-for-sale, all of which were accounted for at fair value, had an aggregate fair value of $8433 millionand $7384 million, respectively, and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $8150 millionand $7060 millionat November30, 2015and 2014, respectively.In addition, the Lennar Financial Services segment recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services' other assets as of November30, 2015and 2014. Fair value of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the Companys servicing sales contracts.Provision for LossesThe Company establishes reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. Loan origination liabilities are included in Lennar Financial Services liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The activity in the Companys loan origination liabilities was as follows:November30,In thousands20152014Loan origination liabilities, beginning of year$11,8189,311Provision for losses4,0402,908Adjustments to pre-existing provisions for losses from changes in estimates  origination liabilities, end of year$19,49211,8181Provision for losses included an adjustment for additional repurchase requests that were received beyond the estimated provision that was recorded.Loans Held-for-Investment, NetLoans for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of mortgage loans carried at lower of cost, net of unamortized discounts. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method.The Lennar Financial Services segment also provides an allowance for loan losses. The provision recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by managements continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, credit worthiness and nature of underlying collateral, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Companys management. Anticipated changes in economic factors, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by the Companys management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While the Companys management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond managements control.Derivative Financial InstrumentsThe Lennar Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. The segment uses mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of fixed rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value included in Lennar Financial Services revenues88Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  Fee RevenueThe Rialto segment provides services to a variety of legal entities and investment vehicles such as funds, joint ventures, co-invests, and other private equity structures to manage their respective investments. As a result, Rialto earns and receives management fees, underwriting fees and due diligence fees. These fees are included in Rialto revenues and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rialto receives investment management fees from investment vehicles based on 1 a percentage of committed capital during the commitment period and after the commitment period ends and 2 a percentage of invested capital less the portion of such invested capital utilized to acquire investments that have been sold in whole or in part or liquidated. Fees earned for underwriting and due diligence services are based on actual costs incurred. In certain situations, Rialto may earn additional fees when the return on assets managed exceeds contractually established thresholds. Such revenue is only booked when the contract terms are met, the contract is at, or near, completion and the amounts are known and collectability is reasonably assured. Since such revenue is recognized during the latter half of the life of the investment vehicle, after substantially all of the assets have been sold and investment gains and losses realized, the possibility of claw backs is limited. In addition, Rialto may also receive tax distributions in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income due to Rialto carried interests in the funds. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks and therefore are recorded as revenue when received.Rialto Mortgage Finance - Loans Held-for-SaleThe originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option for Rialto Mortgage Finance RMF loans held-for-sale in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Management believes that carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments, which are also carried at fair value, used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in a securitization on a servicing released, non-recourse basis; although, the Company remains liable for certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. The Company recognizes revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished. Nonaccrual Loans- Revenue Recognition ImpairmentAt November30, 2015and 2014, there were loans receivable with a carrying value of $887 millionand $1301 million, respectively, for which interest income was not being recognized as they were classified as nonaccrual. When forecasted principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated at the loan acquisition date or subsequently, management classifies the loan as nonaccrual and accounts for these assets in accordance with ASC 310-10, Receivable, ASC 310-10. When a loan is classified as nonaccrual, any subsequent cash receipt is accounted for using the cost recovery method. In accordance with ASC 310-10, a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected. A provision for loan losses is recognized when the recorded investment in the loan is in excess of its fair value. The fair value of the loan is determined by using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of the real estate is determined through a combination of appraisals, broker opinions of value and management best estimate. The fair value of the underlying collateral is determined in part by placing reliance on independent third-party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity.Real Estate OwnedReal estate owned REO represents real estate that the Rialto segment has taken control in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale or at fair value if classified as held-and-used, which becomes the propertys new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third-party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third-party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for anticipated date of sale, location, property 89Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedsize, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, the Company analyzes historical trends, including trends achieved by the Company local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, the Company then calculates its best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. These methods use unobservable inputs to develop fair value for the Companys REO. Due to the volume and variance of unobservable inputs, resulting from the uniqueness of each of the Company REO, the Company does not use a standard range of unobservable inputs with respect to its evaluation of REO. However, for operating properties included within REO, the Company may also use estimated cash flows multiplied by a capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the property. Generally, the capitalization rates used to estimate fair value ranged from 8%to 12%and varied based on the location of the asset, asset type and occupancy rates for the operating properties.Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by the Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REOs fair value net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale, is recorded as an unrealized gain upon foreclosure in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REOs fair value net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale is generally recorded as a provision for loan losses in the Companys consolidated statements of operations.Additionally, REO includes real estate which Rialto has purchased directly from financial institutions. These REOs are recorded at cost or allocated cost if purchased in a bulk transaction.Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying value or current fair value, less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale. Held-and-used assets are tested for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recorded for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any subsequent impairment losses, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto other income expense, net. REO assets classified as held-and-used are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. REO assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated. Occasionally an asset will require certain improvements to yield a higher return. In accordance with ASC 970-340-25, Real Estate, construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development of the asset may be capitalized. Derivative InstrumentsThe Rialto segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments on loans held-for-sale in order to minimize its exposure to fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates as well as lessen its credit risk. The segment hedges interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and swap futures. These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with derivative instruments in gain positions recorded in other assets while derivative instruments in loss positions are recorded in other liabilities.Consolidations of Variable Interest EntitiesIn 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40%managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies LLCs, in partnership with the FDIC. The Company determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, Consolidations, ASC 810-10-65-2, the Company identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance and determined that it has the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs portfolios of assets, which consisted primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans. At November30, 2015, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $3552 millionand $113 million, respectively. At November30, 2014, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of $5084 millionand $215 million, respectively.The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate the Companys role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolios. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without 90Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedthe FDICs approval, the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, the Company can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans e.g. REO and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but the Company can decide not to follow the FDICs suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDICs voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs economic performance.In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, the Company determined that it had an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors:Rialto/Lennar owns 40%of the equity of the LLCs and has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact their economic performance through loan resolutions and the sale of REO.Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which the Company earns a 05%servicing fee.Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to $10 million.The Company is aware that the FDIC, as the owner of 60%of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE.Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810-10-65-2 are met, the Company consolidated the LLCs.Voting Interest EntitiesRialto Real Estate Fund, LP Fund I, Rialto Real Estate Fund II, LP Fund II, Rialto Real Estate Fund III Fund III and the Rialto Mezzanine Partners Fund, LP Mezzanine Fund are unconsolidated entities and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. They were determined to have the attributes of an investment company in accordance with ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies, the attributes of which are different from the attributes that would cause a company to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value with increases/decreases in fair value recorded in their respective statements of operations, the Companys share of which will be recorded in the Rialto equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities financial statement line item. The Company determined that Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund are not variable interest entities but rather voting interest entities due to the following factors:The Company determined that Rialtos general partner interest and all the limited partners interests qualify as equity investment at risk.Based on the capital structure of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund 100% capitalized via equity contributions, the Company was able to conclude that the equity investment at risk was sufficient to allow Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.The general partner and the limited partners in Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund, collectively, have full decision-making ability as they collectively have the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund, since Rialto, in addition to being a general partner with a substantive equity investment in Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund, also provides services to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund under a management agreement and an investment agreement, which are not separable from Rialtos general partnership interest.As a result of all these factors, the Company has concluded that the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund reside in its general partnership interest and thus with the holders of the equity investment at risk.In addition, there are no guaranteed returns provided to the equity investors and the equity contributions are fully subjected to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund operational results, thus the equity investors absorb the expected negative and positive variability relative to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund.Finally, substantially all of the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund are not conducted on behalf of any individual investor or related group that has disproportionately few voting rights i.e., on behalf of any individual limited partner91Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedHaving concluded that Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund are voting interest entities, the Company has evaluated the funds under the voting interest entity model to determine whether, as general partner, it has control over Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund. The Company determined that it does not control Fund I, Fund II, Fund III or the Mezzanine Fund as its general partner, because the unaffiliated limited partners have substantial kick-out rights and can remove Rialto as general partner at any time for cause or without cause through a simple majority vote of the limited partners. In addition, there are no significant barriers to the exercise of these rights. As a result of determining that the Company does not control Fund I, Fund II, Fund III or the Mezzanine Fund under the voting interest entity model, Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and the Mezzanine Fund are not consolidated in the Companys financial statements.Lennar MultifamilyManagement Fees and General Contractor RevenueThe Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which the Company has investments. As a result, the Lennar Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are included in Lennar Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Lennar Multifamily provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method. New Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contracts which include i identifying the contracts with the customer, ii identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, iii determining the transaction price, iv allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and v recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The Company has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company consolidated financial statements.In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation Topic 810: Amendments to the Consolidation AnalysisASU 2015-02. ASU 2015-02 amends the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required. ASU 2015-02 requires management to reevaluate all legal entities under a revised consolidation model specifically i modify the evaluation of whether limited partnership and similar legal entities are VIEs, ii eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, iii affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and iv provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2016 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software Subtopic 350-40: Customers' Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing ArrangementASU 2015-05. ASU 2015-05 provides guidance for a customer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license or should be accounted for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2016 and subsequent interim periods. As permitted, the Company has elected early adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 will not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period AdjustmentsASU 2015-16. ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 will be effective 92Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedfor the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesASU 2016-01. ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements2. Operating and Reporting SegmentsAs of and for the year ended November30, 2015, the Companys operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. The Companys reportable segments consist of:1Homebuilding East2Homebuilding Central3Homebuilding West4Homebuilding Southeast Florida5Homebuilding Houston6Lennar Financial Services7Rialto8Lennar MultifamilyInformation about homebuilding activities in which the Companys homebuilding activities are not economically similar to other states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other, which is not considered a reportable segment. Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings loss before income taxes. Operations of the Companys homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Companys unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings loss for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities and other income expense, net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and other interest expense of the segment. As of November30, 2015, the Companys reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have operations located in:East:Florida1, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and VirginiaCentral:Arizona, Colorado and Texas2West:California and NevadaSoutheast Florida:Southeast FloridaHouston:Houston, TexasOther:Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington1Florida in the East reportable segment excludes Southeast Florida, which is its own reportable segment2Texas in the Central reportable segment excludes Houston, Texas, which is its own reportable segment.Operations of the Lennar Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Companys homes and others. The Lennar Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Lennar Financial Services operating earnings consist of revenues generated primarily from mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services, less the cost of such services and certain selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment. The Lennar Financial Services segment operates generally in the same states as the Companys homebuilding operations as well as in other states93Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  of the Rialto segment include raising, investing and managing third-party capital, originating and securitizing commercial mortgage loans as well as investing its own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities.

For the year ended November30, 2013, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities included $198 millionof equity in earnings primarily as a result of sales of homesites to third parties by one unconsolidated entity3.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral for accounts receivable. Mortgages and notes receivable arising from the sale of land are generally collateralized by the property sold to the buyer. Allowances are maintained for potential credit losses based on historical experience, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Company4. Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated EntitiesSummarized condensed financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuildings unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:Statements of OperationsYears Ended November30,In  and  income49,34314,602Net earnings loss of unconsolidated  Homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities$63,37335523,803For the year ended November30, 2015, net earnings of unconsolidated entities included the sale of approximately 1,800homesites and a commercial property by El Toro for $11 billionthat resulted in $3732 millionof gross profit, of which 1 approximately 300homesites were sold to Lennar for $1396 millionthat resulted in $493 millionof gross profit, of which the Company portion was deferred, 2 approximately 800homesites were sold to a joint venture in which the Company has a 50% investment and for which the Company portion of the gross profit from the sale was deferred, and 3 approximately 700homesites and a commercial property were sold to third parties. In addition, net earnings for the year ended November30, 2015included a gain on debt extinguishment related to a debt paydown by El Toro. These transactions resulted primarily in the recognition of $828 millionof Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings for the year ended November30, 2015.For the year ended November30, 2014, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities related primarily to the Company share of operating losses from various Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, which included $46 millionof valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, partially offset by $47 millionof equity in earnings as a result of third-party land sales by one unconsolidated entity. For the year ended November30, 2013, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities included $198 millionof equity in earnings primarily as a result of sales of homesites to third parties by one unconsolidated entity97Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedBalance SheetsNovember30,In thousands20152014Assets:Cash and cash   and equity:Accounts payable and other  of November30, 2015and 2014, the Companys recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were $7416 millionand $6568 million, respectively, while the underlying equity in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners net assets as of November30, 2015and 2014was $8395 millionand $7226 million, respectively. The basis difference is primarily as a result of the Company buying an interest in a partner equity in a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity at a discount to book value, contributing non-monetary assets to an unconsolidated entity with a higher fair value than book value and deferring equity in earnings on land sales.During the year ended November30, 2015, the Company bought out the partner of one of its unconsolidated entities for approximately $10 millionof which $7 millionwas paid in cash and the remainder was financed with a short-term note. As a result, the Company $70 millioninvestment in the unconsolidated entity was reclassified primarily to inventory.During the year ended November30, 2015, El Toro sold approximately 800homesites to a joint venture, in which the Company has a 50%investment, for $4720 millionof which $320 millionwas financed through a non-recourse note. This transaction resulted in $1574 millionof gross profit, of which the Company portion was deferred. In addition, this transaction resulted in an increase in inventory, other assets and debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities reflected in the summarized condensed financial information presented in the previous table.The Companys partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. The unconsolidated entities follow accounting principles that are in all material respects the same as those used by the Company. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the day-to-day manager under the direction of a management committee that has shared powers amongst the partners of the unconsolidated entities and receives management fees and/or reimbursement of expenses for performing this function. During the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities totaling $313 million, $307 millionand $188 million, respectively.The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the Company receives the options. During the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, $1776 million, $590 millionand $1925 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to the Company. The Company does not include in its Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities its pro-rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of the Companys share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until the Company delivers a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.The Lennar Homebuilding entities in which the Company has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, the Company and its partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities98Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe total debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments was as follows:November30,Dollars in  bank debt and other debt partners share of several  land seller debt and other debt 1324,0004,022Non-recourse debt with completion guarantees 2146,760442,854Non-recourse debt without completion  debt to the Company781,905713,274The Companys maximum recourse exposure10,98124,481Total debt$792,886737,755The Companys maximum recourse exposure as a % of total JV debt1%3%1Non-recourse land seller debt and other debt as of November30, 2015included a $320 millionnon-recourse note related to a transaction between El Toro and an unconsolidated joint venture, described previously2The decrease in non-recourse debt with completion guarantees was primarily related to a debt paydown by El Toro as a result of sales of homesites and debt extinguishment.In most instances in which the Company has guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, the Companys partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payments. Historically, the Company has had repayment guarantees and/or maintenance guarantees. In a repayment guarantee, the Company and its venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral. In the event of default, if the Companys venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, the Company may be liable for more than its proportionate share, up to its maximum recourse exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value or the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. As of both November30, 2015and 2014, the Company did not have any maintenance guarantees related to its Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, the Company and its joint venture partners or entities related to them have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.If the Company is required to make a payment under any guarantee, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase the Company investment in the unconsolidated entity and its share of any funds the entity distributes.As of both November30, 2015and 2014, the fair values of the repayment guarantees and completion guarantees were not material. The Company believes that as of November30, 2015, in the event it becomes legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or the Company and its partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, the Company has placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for its joint ventures see Note 699Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued5. Lennar Homebuilding Operating Properties and EquipmentOperating properties and equipment are included in Lennar Homebuilding other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and were as follows:November30,In thousands20152014Operating properties 1$93,174161,741Leasehold  fixtures and  depreciation and  properties primarily include rental operations and commercial properties.

Debt issuance costs as of November30, 2015and 2014were $264 millionand $289 million, respectively In April 2015, the Company amended its unsecured revolving credit facility the Credit Facility to reduce the interest rate and increase the maximum potential borrowing capacity. At November30, 2015, the Company had a $16 billionCredit Facility, which includes a $163 millionaccordion feature, subject to additional commitments with certain financial institutions. The maturity for $13 billionof the Credit Facility is in June 2019, with the remainder maturing in June 2018. The proceeds available under the Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement also provides that up to $500 millionin commitments may be used for letters of credit. As of both November30, 2015and 2014, the Company had nooutstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. Under the Credit Facility agreement, the Company is required to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio and either a liquidity or an interest coverage ratio. These ratios are calculated per the Credit Facility agreement, which involves adjustments to GAAP financial measures. The Company believes it was in compliance with its debt covenants at November30, 2015. In addition, the Company had $315 millionletter of credit facilities with different financial institutions100Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Companys performance letters of credit outstanding were $2365 millionand $2341 millionat November30, 2015and 2014, respectively. The Companys financial letters of credit outstanding were $2167 millionand $1904 millionat November30, 2015and 2014, respectively. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the Companys performance of certain development and construction activities. Financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at November30, 2015, the Company had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects including certain projects of the Companys joint ventures of $13 billion, which includes $2234 millionrelated to pending litigation. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. As of November30, 2015, there were approximately $4900 million, or 38%, of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements. The Company does not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds or letters of credit, but if any such draws occur, the Company does not believe they would have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.The terms of each of the Company senior and convertible senior notes outstanding at November30, 2015were as follows:Senior and Convertible Senior Notes Outstanding 1Principal AmountNet Proceeds 2PriceDates IssuedDollars in thousands650% senior notes due  20061225% senior notes due  2009475% senior notes due 2017400,000395,900100%July 2012, August 2012695% senior notes due 2018250,000243,90098929%May 20104125% senior notes due 2018  20134500% senior notes due 2019500,000495,7254February 2014450% senior notes due 2019600,000595,8015November 2014, February 2015275% convertible senior notes due 2020 6446,000436,400100%November 2010325% convertible senior notes due  2011, December 20114750% senior notes due 2022 3575,000567,5857October 2012, February 2013, April 20134875% senior notes due  20154750% senior notes due 2025500,000495,528100%April 20151Interest is payable semi-annually for each of the series of senior and convertible senior notes.

However, it is the Companys intent to settle the face value of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes in cash. Shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because even though it is the Company intent to settle the face value of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes in cash, the Company volume weighted average stock price exceeded the conversion price. For the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013, the Company volume weighted average stock price was $4861, $3996and $3706, respectively, which exceeded the conversion price, thus 86 millionshares, 90 millionshares and 82 millionshares, respectively, were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.At November30, 2015, holders may convert the 275%Convertible Senior Notes at the initial conversion rate of 451794shares of ClassA common stock per $1,000principal amount or 10,567,145shares of ClassA common stock if all the remaining 275%Convertible Senior Notes are converted, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $2213per share of ClassA common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments.

Holders of the 275% Convertible Senior Notes had the right to require the Company to repurchase them for cash equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest, on December15, 2015, but none of them elected to do so.The Company has the right to redeem the 275% Convertible Senior Notes at any time on or after December20, 2015 for 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest.During the year ended November30, 2015, the Company exchanged and converted approximately $212 millionin aggregate principal amount of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes for approximately $213 millionin cash and 52 millionshares of Class A common stock, including accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of completion of the exchanges and conversions.

The amount of contingent interest payable per $1,000principal amount of notes during the applicable interest period will equal 075%per year of the average trading price of such $1,000principal amount of 275%Convertible Senior Notes during the five trading day reference period.Certain provisions under ASC 470, Debt, require the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuers non-convertible debt borrowing rate. The Company has applied these provisions to its 275%Convertible Senior Notes. At issuance, the Company estimated the fair value of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes using similar debt instruments that did not have a conversion feature and allocated the residual value to an equity component that represented the estimated fair value of the conversion feature at issuance. The debt discount of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes was amortized over the five years ended November30, 2015, and the annual effective interest rate was 71%after giving effect to the amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs. At November30, 2015and 2014, the principal amount of the 275%Convertible Senior Notes was $2339 millionand $4460 million, respectively.

This difference was neither accreted into income nor recorded on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the cost of the loans acquired was referred to as the accretable yield and was recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loans using the effective yield method. During the fourth quarter of 2014, in an effort to better reflect the performance of the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios, Rialto changed from recording accretable yield income on a loan pool basis to recording income on a cost recovery basis per loan as the timing and amount of expected cash flows on the remaining loan portfolios could no longer be reasonably estimated. 106Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedFor the year ended November30, 2015, there was no activity in the accretable yield for the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios as all the remaining accreting loans were classified as nonaccrual loans during the fourth quarter of 2014, as explained above.

The risk of nonaccrual loans relates to a decline in the value of the collateral securing the outstanding obligation and the recognition of an impairment through an allowance for loan losses if the recorded investment in the loan exceeds its fair value.

The risk associated with loans in this category relates to the possible default by the borrower with respect to principal and interest payments and/or the possible decline in value of the underlying collateral and thus, both could cause a decline in the forecasted cash flows used to determine accretable yield income under ASC 310-30 and the recognition of an impairment through an allowance for loan losses but can be reversed if conditions improve.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by the Company based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a more-likely-than-not standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Companys experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.As of November30, 2015and 2014, the net deferred tax assets included a valuation allowance of $59 millionand $80 million, respectively, primarily related to state net operating loss NOL carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carryforward periods that exist in certain states. During the year ended November30, 2015, the Company reversed $21 millionof valuation allowance due to the utilization or expiration of state net operating losses. During the year ended November30, 2014, the Company reversed $47 millionof valuation allowance, primarily due to the utilization of federal and state net operating losses. 115Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedAt November30, 2015and 2014, the Company had federal tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling $19 millionand $20 million, respectively, that may be carried forward up to 20years to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2029.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value DisclosuresThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at November30, 2015and 2014, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The fair value for investments held-to-maturity is based on discounted cash flows. For notes and other debts payable, the fair value is calculated based on discounted cash flows using the Companys weighted average borrowing rate and for the warehouse repurchase financing agreements fair values approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities. Lennar Financial ServicesThe fair values above are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair values for instruments that do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial information. For notes and other debt payable, the fair values approximate their carrying value due to variable interest pricing terms and short-term nature of the borrowing.Lennar HomebuildingFor senior notes and other debts payable, the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings is based on quoted market prices and the fair value of variable-rate borrowings is based on expected future cash flows calculated using current market forward rates.Fair Value MeasurementsGAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosures about fair value measurements and establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value summarized as follows:Level 1:Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.Level 2:Fair value determined using significant other observable inputs.Level 3:Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs120Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Companys financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:In  Value at November 30, 2015Fair Value at November 30, 2014Lennar Homebuilding Assets:Investments available-for-saleLevel 3$523480Rialto Financial Assets:Loans held-for-sale 1Level 3$316,275113,596Interest rate swaps and swap futuresLevel 1$280Credit default swapsLevel 2$6,1531,694Rialto Financial Liabilities:Interest rate swaps and swap futuresLevel 1$9781,376Credit default swapsLevel 2$720766Lennar Financial Services Assets:Loans held-for-sale  available-for-saleLevel 1$42,82716,799Mortgage loan commitmentsLevel 2$13,06012,687Forward contractsLevel 2$5317,576Mortgage servicing rightsLevel 3$16,77017,3531The aggregate fair value of Rialto loans held-for-sale of $3163 millionat November30, 2015exceeds their aggregate principal balance of $3143 millionby $20 million.

Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:Lennar Homebuilding investments available-for-sale The fair value of these investments is based on third-party valuations and/or estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows and it is included in the Lennar Homebuilding segment other assets.Rialto loans held-for-sale The fair value of loans held-for-sale is calculated from model-based techniques that use discounted cash flow assumptions and the Companys own estimates of CMBS spreads, market interest rate movements and the underlying loan credit quality. Loan values are calculated by allocating the change in value of an assumed CMBS capital structure to each loan. The value of an assumed CMBS capital structure is calculated, generally, by discounting the cash flows associated with each CMBS class at market interest rates and at the Companys own estimate of CMBS spreads. The Company estimates CMBS spreads by observing the pricing of recent CMBS offerings, secondary CMBS markets, changes in the CMBX index, and general capital and commercial real estate market conditions. Considerations in estimating CMBS spreads include comparing the Companys current loan portfolio with comparable CMBS offerings containing loans with similar duration, credit quality and collateral composition. These methods use unobservable inputs in estimating a discount rate that is used to assign a value to each loan. While the cash payments on the loans are contractual, the discount rate used and assumptions regarding the relative size of each class in the CMBS capital structure can significantly impact the valuation. Therefore, the estimates used could differ materially from the fair value determined when the loans are sold to a securitization trust.Rialto interest rate swaps and swap futures The fair value of interest rate swaps derivatives is based on observable values for underlying interest rates and market determined risk premiums. The fair value of interest rate swap futures derivatives is based on quoted market prices for identical investments traded in active markets.Rialto credit default swaps The fair value of credit default swaps derivatives is based on quoted market prices for similar investments traded in active markets121Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedLennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale as of November30, 2015and 2014. Fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics.Lennar Financial Services investments available-for-sale The fair value of these investments is based on the quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.Lennar Financial Services mortgage loan commitments Fair value of commitments to originate loans is based upon the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Lennar Financial Services segment has committed to originate the loans. The fair value of commitments to sell loan contracts is the estimated amount that the Lennar Financial Services segment would receive or pay to terminate the commitments at the reporting date based on market prices for similar financial instruments. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics. The fair value of the mortgage loan commitments and related servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services other assets. Lennar Financial Services forward contracts Fair value is based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments. The fair value of forward contracts is included in the Lennar Financial Services segment other assets as of November30, 2015. The fair value of forward contracts is included in the Lennar Financial Services segment other liabilities as of November30, 2014.The Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge its mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting the Companys counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting the Companys credit standards. The segments risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At November30, 2015, the segment had open commitments amounting to $10 billionto sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2016.Lennar Financial Services mortgage servicing rights Lennar Financial Services records mortgage servicing rights when it sells loans on a servicing-retained basis or through the acquisition or assumption of the right to service a financial asset. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated using third-party valuations. The key assumptions, which are generally unobservable inputs, used in the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights include mortgage prepayment rates, discount rates and delinquency rates. As of November30, 2015, the key assumptions used in determining the fair value include a 122%mortgage prepayment rate, a 121%discount rate and a 75%delinquency rate. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is included in the Lennar Financial Services segment other assets122Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe changes in fair value for Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments measured on a recurring basis are shown below by financial instrument and financial statement line item:Years Ended November30,In thousands201520142013Changes in fair value included in Lennar Financial Services revenues:Loans  loan   available-for-sale$26Changes in fair value included in Rialto revenues:Financial Assets:Interest rate swaps and swap futures$280Credit default swaps$477288Financial Liabilities:Interest rate swaps and swap futures$3981,34631Credit default swaps$148349318Changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income loss, net of tax:Lennar Financial Services investments  on Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale and Rialto loans held-for-sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and recorded as revenues in the Lennar Financial Services statement of operations and Rialto statement of operations, respectively.The following table represents the reconciliations of the beginning and ending balance for the Level 3 recurring fair value measurements:Years Ended November 30,20152014Lennar Financial ServicesLennar HomebuildingRialtoLennar Financial ServicesLennar HomebuildingRialtoIn thousandsMortgage servicing rightsInvestments available-for-saleLoans held-for-saleMortgage servicing rightsInvestments available-for-saleLoans held-for-saleBeginning of  originations  originations sold, including those not   in fair value  and principal paydowns37800End of  the year ended November30, 2014, the Lennar Financial Services mortgage and servicing rights included the $57 millionacquisition of a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights.

Consolidation of Variable Interest EntitiesThe Company evaluated the joint venture agreements of its joint ventures that were formed or that had reconsideration events during the year ended November30, 2015. Based on the Companys evaluation, no VIEs were consolidated during the year ended November30, 2015. In addition, during the year ended November30, 2015, the Company deconsolidated an entity within its Lennar Multifamily segment that had total combined assets of $174 millionprimarily operating properties and equipment and liabilities of $12 million. The Companys recorded investments in unconsolidated entities were as follows:November 30,In thousands20152014Lennar   VIEsAs of November30, 2015, the carrying amount of the VIEs assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated were $6523 millionand $844 million, respectively. As of November30, 2014, the carrying amount of the VIEs assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated were $9291 millionand $1498 million, respectively. Those assets are owned by, and those liabilities are obligations of, the VIEs, not the Company.A VIEs assets can only be used to settle obligations of that VIE. The VIEs are not guarantors of the Companys senior notes and other debts payable. In addition, the assets held by a VIE usually are collateral for that VIEs debt. The Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to a VIE unless the Company and/or the other partners have entered into debt guarantees with the VIEs banks. Other than debt guarantee agreements with a VIEs banks, there are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to a VIE. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contracts.Unconsolidated VIEsAt November30, 2015and 2014, the Companys recorded investments in VIEs that are unconsolidated and its estimated maximum exposure to loss were as follows:November30, 2015In thousandsInvestments  Homebuilding 1$102,706111,215Rialto 225,62525,625Lennar Multifamily  2014In thousandsInvestments  to LossLennar Homebuilding 1$124,311194,321Rialto 217,29017,290Lennar Multifamily  November30, 2015and 2014, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Homebuildings investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $83 millionand $700 million, respectively, remaining commitment to fund an unconsolidated entity for further expenses up until the unconsolidated entity obtains permanent financing.

At November30, 2015and 2014, investments in unconsolidated VIEs and Lennars maximum exposure to loss included $256 millionand $173 million, respectively, related to Rialtos investments held-to-maturity3As of November30, 2015, the remaining equity commitment of $3783 millionto fund the Venture for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects is included in Lennar maximum exposure to loss. In addition, at November30, 2015and 2014, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Multifamily investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to $300 millionand $234 million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding for certain of the unconsolidated VIEs that could be drawn upon in the event of default under their debt agreements. While these entities are VIEs, the Company has determined that the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance is generally shared and the Company and its partners are not de facto agents. While the Company generally manages the day-to-day operations of the VIEs, each of these VIEs has an executive committee made up of representatives from each partner. The members of the executive committee have equal votes and major decisions require unanimous consent and approval from all members. The Company does not have the unilateral ability to exercise participating voting rights without partner consent.The Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to the VIEs, except for $3783 millionremaining equity commitment to fund the Venture for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects and $300 millionof letters of credit outstanding for certain Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated VIEs that could be drawn upon in the event of default under their debt agreements. In addition, there are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to the VIEs, except with regard to a $83 millionremaining commitment to fund a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity for further expenses up until the unconsolidated entity obtains permanent financing. Except for the unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, the Company and the other partners did not guarantee any debt of the other unconsolidated VIEs. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its unconsolidated VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contracts.Option ContractsThe Company has access to land through option contracts, which generally enables it to control portions of properties owned by third parties including land funds and unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether to exercise the option.The Company evaluates all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or makes a significant deposit for optioned land, it may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land.During the year ended November30, 2015, consolidated inventory not owned increased by $64 millionwith a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to more construction started on homesites not owned than homesite takedowns. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, the Company had a net reclass related to option deposits from consolidated inventory not owned to land under development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November30, 2015. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and the Companys cash deposits.The Companys exposure to loss related to its option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of its non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling $892 millionand $856 millionat November30, 2015and 2014, respectively. Additionally, the Company had posted $704 millionand $345 millionof letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts as of November30, 2015and 2014, respectively126Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued16. Commitments and Contingent LiabilitiesThe Company is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a party to various lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These lawsuits include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of properties and disputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell properties. The Company has been engaged in litigation since 2008 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland regarding whether the Company is required by a contract it entered into in 2005 to purchase a property in Maryland. After entering into the contract, the Company later renegotiated the purchase price, reducing it from $200 millionto $134 million, $20 millionof which has been paid and subsequently written off, leaving a balance of $114 million. In January 2015, the District Court rendered a decision ordering the Company to purchase the property for the $114 millionbalance of the contract price, to pay interest at the rate of 12%per annum from May 27, 2008, and to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes and attorneys fees. The Company believes the decision is contrary to applicable law and has appealed the decision. The Company does not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and, therefore, no liability has been recorded with respect to this case.If the District Court decision were affirmed in its entirety, the Company would purchase the property and record it at fair value, which the Company believes would not result in an impairment. The amount of interest the Company would be required to pay has been the subject of further proceedings before the court. On June 29, 2015, the court ruled that interest will be calculated as simple interest at the rate of 12%per annum from May 27, 2008 until the date the Company purchases the property. Simple interest on $114 millionat 12%per annum will accrue at the rate of $137 millionper year, totaling approximately $103 millionas of November30, 2015. In addition, if the Company is required to purchase the property, it will be obligated to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes, which currently total $16 million. The Company has not engaged in discovery regarding the amount of the plaintiffs attorneys fees. If the District Court decision was totally reversed on appeal, the Company would not have to purchase the property or pay interest, real estate taxes or attorneys fees. In its June 29, 2015 ruling, the District Court determined that the Company will be permitted to stay the judgment during appeal by posting a bond in the amount of $2234 millionrelated to pending litigation. The District Court calculated this amount by adding 12%per annum simple interest to the $114 millionpurchase price for the period beginning May 27, 2008 through May 26, 2016, the date the District Court estimates the appeal of the case will be concluded. The posting of this bond did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial position. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into.The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase, development and sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts generally enable the Company to control portions of properties owned by third parties including land funds and unconsolidated entities until the Company determines whether to exercise the option. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At November30, 2015, the Company had $892 millionof non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites, which were included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the noncancellable leases in effect at November30, 2015were as follows:In  expense for the years ended November30, 2015, 2014and 2013was $559 million, $489 millionand $419 million, respectively127Table of ContentsLENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinuedThe Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $4532 millionat November30, 2015. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects including certain projects in the Companys joint ventures of $13 billion, which includes $2234 millionrelated to pending litigation. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. As of November30, 2015, there were approximately $4900 million, or 38%, of costs to complete related to these site improvements. The Company does not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Over the last several years there has been an industry-wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. Mortgage investors could seek to have the Company buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans that the Company has sold based on claims that the Company breached its limited representations or warranties. The Companys mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed the Companys expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred17.

The entities referred to as guarantors in the following tables are subsidiaries that are not finance company subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and were guaranteeing the senior notes because at November30, 2015they were guaranteeing Lennar Corporation letter of credit facilities and its Credit Facility, disclosed in Note 6. The guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. A subsidiary guarantee will be suspended at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least $75 millionprincipal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation, and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of. For purposes of the condensed consolidating statement of cash flows included in the following supplemental financial information, the Company accounting policy is to treat cash received by Lennar Corporation the Parent from its subsidiaries, to the extent of net earnings from such subsidiaries as a dividend and accordingly a return on investment within cash flows from operating activities. Distributions of capital received by the Parent from its subsidiaries are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. The cash outflows associated with the return on investment dividends and distributions of capital received by the Parent are reflected by the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries in the Dividends line item within cash flows from financing activities. All other cash flows between the Parent and its subsidiaries represent the settlement of receivables and payables between such entities in conjunction with the Parent centralized cash management arrangement with its subsidiaries, which operates with the characteristics of a revolving credit facility, and are accordingly reflected net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from investing activities for the Parent and net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from financing activities for the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries128Table of ContentsLENNAR

Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November30, 2015to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.Our CEO and CFO also participated in an evaluation by our management of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November30, 2015. That evaluation did not identify any changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm obtained from Deloitte Touche LLP relating to the effectiveness of Lennar Corporations internal control over financial reporting are included elsewhere in this document.Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework2013,our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November30, 2015. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2015has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein138Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar CorporationWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November30, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November30, 2015, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended November30, 2015of the Company and our report dated January22, 2016expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements./s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLPCertified Public AccountantsMiami, FloridaJanuary 22, 2016139Table of ContentsItem9.
