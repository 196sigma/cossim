Notes to Consolidated Financial    40              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ugly Duckling Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ugly
Duckling Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ugly
Duckling Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2001 in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Organization, Operations and Acquisitions
Ugly Duckling Corporation, a Delaware corporation the Company, was
incorporated in April 1996 as the successor to Ugly Duckling Holdings, Inc.
UDH, an Arizona corporation formed in 1992.
The Company, through wholly owned subsidiaries, operates 76 used car sales
dealerships, 13 inspection centers, 2 servicing centers and two loan-servicing
facilities.  Three additional wholly owned special purpose securitization
subsidiaries are Ugly Duckling Receivables Corporation II, Ugly Duckling
Receivables Corporation III and IV, all of which are bankruptcy remote
subsidiaries. Their assets at December 31, 2001 included continuing residuals
in finance receivables sold and investments held in trust and at December 31,
2000, included both continuing and discontinued residuals in finance receivables
sold and investments held in trust in the amounts of $700 million and $723
million, respectively. The assets of these three special purpose securitization
subsidiaries generally would not be available to satisfy claims of creditors of
the Company.
As part of our restructuring and cost reduction plan implemented in 2001,
we closed our Clearwater, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona loan servicing centers
and consolidated their operations into our Gilbert, Arizona and Dallas, Texas
loan servicing centers. In addition we closed two service centers, one located
in California and the other in Texas, and one dealership located in Arizona and
consolidated its business with another one of our stores.
During 1999 and 1997 the Company completed a total of five acquisitions.
These acquisitions were recorded in accordance with the purchase method of
accounting, and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the
assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair values of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill, which is
being amortized over periods ranging from fifteen to twenty years. The results
of operations of the acquired entities have been included in the accompanying
statements of operations from the respective acquisition dates.
During 1999, the Company completed two acquisitions of two portfolios and
nine car sales locations. In August, 1999, the Company acquired certain assets
of DCT of Ocala Corporation, including four dealerships in Orlando, Florida and
a loan portfolio of approximately $15 million in exchange for approximately
$121 million in cash. In November 1999, the Company acquired certain assets of
Virginia Auto Mart, including five dealerships in Richmond, Virginia and a loan
portfolio of approximately $68 million in exchange for approximately $39
million in cash and $27 million in debt provided by the sellers. The debt
balance was zero as of December 31, 2001. The excess of the purchase price over
the fair values of the net assets acquired was approximately $11 million.
2 Discontinued Operations
During the first quarter of 1998, the Company closed its branch office
network the Branch Offices through which the Company purchased retail
installment loans, and exited this line of business. The Company plans to
complete servicing its existing portfolio. The Company recorded a pre-tax charge
to discontinued operations of $151 million approximately $92 million, net of
income taxes in 1998 for branch closing costs, loan losses and related loan
servicing expenses. Loan losses and related loan servicing expenses exceeded
amounts originally provided for such activities and in the fourth quarter of
1999 the Company recorded an additional charge of $25 million $15 million net
of income tax for costs and loan losses associated with the remaining portfolio
servicing activities. The Company has reclassified the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations of the Branch Offices
to Discontinued Operations.
The Company Cygnet Dealer program provided qualified used car dealers
with warehouse purchase facilities and revolving lines of credit primarily
secured by the dealers' finance receivable portfolios. In December 1999, the
Company sold its Cygnet Dealer Finance CDF subsidiary to an entity controlled
by Ernest C. Garcia II, Chairman and principal shareholder of the Company, for
approximately $375 million,  the estimated book value of the Company
investment in CDF. As a result of the sale, CDF has been reclassified as
discontinued operations for 1999 and all preceding years.
The purchase price of CDF was paid through the assumption by the buyer of
approximately $80 million of outstanding debt owed by the Company to Verde
Investments Inc. Verde, an affiliate of Mr. Garcia, a $12 million, and 10-year
promissory note from the buyer to the Company that is guaranteed by Verde, and
the remainder in cash. The note is subordinate to the initial financing obtained
by Cygnet Dealer.   Effective December 31, 1999, the Company adopted a formal plan to abandon
any effort for its third party dealer operations to acquire loans or servicing
rights to additional portfolios. Accordingly, the Company Cygnet Servicing and
the associated Cygnet Corporate segment also are reported as components of
discontinued operations. The Company plans to complete servicing the portfolios
that it currently services.
No gain or loss has been recorded on the disposal of Cygnet Servicing as
the Company anticipates that over the servicing period, expected to be 18 months
remaining from December 31, 2001, it will realize a net gain.

3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company provides sales finance services in connection with the sales of
used cars to individuals residing in numerous metropolitan areas. The Company
operated a total of 76, 77, and 72 used car dealerships Company dealerships at
December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively in eleven metropolitan markets
in 2001, 2000 and 1999.   Periodically during the year, the Company maintains cash in financial
institutions in excess of the amounts insured by the federal government.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
generally consist of interest-bearing money market accounts.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from the sales of used cars is recognized upon delivery, when the
sales contract is signed and the agreed-upon down payment has been received.
Interest income is recognized using the interest method. Direct loan
origination costs related to loans originated at Company dealerships are
deferred and charged against finance income over the life of the related
installment sales loan using the interest method. The accrual of interest for
accounting purposes is suspended if collection becomes doubtful, generally 90
days past due, and is resumed when the loan becomes current. Interest income
also includes income on the Company residual interests from its securitization
program.
Residuals in Finance Receivables Sold, Investments Held in Trust, and Gain on
Sale of Loans
Under the current legal structure of the securitization program, the
Company sells loans to Company subsidiaries that then securitize the loans by
transferring them to separate trusts that issue several classes of notes and
certificates collateralized by the loans. The securitization subsidiaries then
sell Class A notes or certificates Class A obligations to investors, and
subordinate classes are retained by the Company. The Company continues to
service the securitized loans.
The Class A obligations have historically received investment grade
ratings. To secure the payment of the Class A obligations, the securitization
subsidiaries have obtained an insurance policies from MBIA Insurance Corporation
that guarantees payment of amounts to the holders of the Class A obligations.
Additionally, a cash reserve account is established for the benefit of the
Class A obligations holders. The reserve accounts are classified in the
financial statements as Investments Held in Trust and are a component of Finance
Receivables, Net.
For securitization transactions closed during the third quarter of 1998 and
prior years, gains on sale were computed based upon the difference between the
sales proceeds for the portion of finance receivables sold and the Company
recorded investment in the finance receivables sold. The Company allocated the
recorded investment in the finance receivables between the portion of the
finance receivables sold and the portion retained based on the relative fair
values on the date of sale. The retained portion is reported as Residuals in
Finance Receivables Sold and is a component of Finance Receivables, Net.
Residuals in Finance Receivables Sold represents the present value of
future cash flows from the underlying trust portfolios. These securitization
transactions were discounted with a rate of 12% using the cash out method. To
the extent that actual cash flows on a securitization are below original
estimates and differ materially from the original securitization assumptions
and, in the opinion of management, those differences appear to be other than
temporary in nature, the Company residual will be adjusted, with corresponding
charges against income in the period in which the adjustment is made. Such
evaluations are performed on a security-by-security basis, for each residual
interest retained by the Company.
Residuals in Finance Receivables are classified as held-to-maturity
securities in accordance with Statement No. 115.
Securitization transactions closed subsequent to September 30, 1998 have
been accounted for as a collateralized borrowing in accordance with Statement
No. 125, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities Statement No. 125, as superseded by Statement
No. 140. The loan contracts included in the transaction remain in Finance
Receivables and the Class A obligations are reflected in Notes Payable. Servicing Income
Under servicing agreements for all Company securitizations, servicing fees
are earned and paid monthly. Servicing Income is recognized when earned for
securitization transactions structured as sales. Servicing Income earned on
securitization  transactions  structured  as  borrowings is eliminated in
consolidation. All servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. In the
event delinquencies and/or losses on any portfolio serviced exceed specified
levels, the Company may be required to transfer the servicing of the portfolio
to another servicer.
Finance Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
Finance Receivables consist of contractually scheduled payments from
installment sales contracts loans net of unearned finance charges, plus
accrued interest receivable, direct loan origination costs, residuals in finance
receivables sold, investments held in trust, and allowance for credit losses.
The Company follows the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with
Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases. Direct loan
origination costs represent the unamortized balance of costs incurred in the
origination of loans.
An allowance for credit losses allowance is established by charging the
provision for credit losses and the allocation of acquired allowances. For loans
generated by the Company dealerships, the allowance is established by charging
the provision for credit losses. To the extent that the allowance is considered
insufficient to absorb anticipated credit losses over the next 12 months,
additions to the allowance are established through a charge to the provision for
credit losses. The evaluation of the allowance considers such factors as the
performance of each dealership loan portfolio, the Company historical credit
losses, the overall portfolio quality and delinquency status, the value of
underlying collateral, and current economic conditions that may affect the
borrowers' ability to pay.
Inventory
Inventory consists of used vehicles held for sale, which is valued at the
lower of cost or market, and repossessed vehicles, which are valued at market
value. Vehicle reconditioning costs are capitalized as a component of inventory
cost. The cost of used vehicles sold is determined on a specific identification
basis.
Property and Equipment
Property and Equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which
range from three to ten years for equipment and thirty years for buildings.
Leasehold and land improvements are amortized using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related
improvements.
The Company has capitalized costs related to the development of software
products for internal use. Capitalization of costs begins during the development
stage and ends when the software is available for general use. Amortization is
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of
seven years. During 2001, the Company made a change in the economic life of
software developed for internal use. In prior years, the Company amortized the
software straight-line over 5 years. In 2001, the economic life was changed to 7
years as we continue to make enhancements to the software that will allow a
longer economic life. The impact of the change in economic life was not
material.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, generally fifteen to twenty years. Effective January 1,
2002 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which required that goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead tested for
impairment at least annually.
Post-Sale Customer Support Programs
A liability for the estimated cost of post sale customer support, including
car repairs and the Company down payment back and credit card programs, is
established at the time the used car is sold by charging Cost of Used Cars Sold.
The liability is evaluated for adequacy through a separate analysis of the
various programs' historical performance. Effective August 1, 2001, the credit
card program was eliminated. Advertising
All costs related to production and advertising are expensed in the period
incurred. The Company had no advertising costs capitalized as of December 31,
2001 and 2000. Total production and advertising costs for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $100 million, $115 million and $99
million respectively.
Interest Expense
The Company allocates interest expense to discontinued operations in
accordance  with guidance under EITF 87-24:  Allocation of Interest to
Discontinued Operations. Interest expense charged to discontinued operations is
limited to the total of interest on debt assumed by the discontinued operations
and an allocation of other consolidated  interest that is not directly
attributable to other continuing operations of the Company. Other consolidated
interest that cannot be allocated to operations of the Company is allocated
based on a uniform ratio of consolidated debt to equity.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date. A valuation allowance is established to the extent that it is
not more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized.
Stock Option Plan
The Company accounts for its stock option plan in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. As such, compensation
expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the
underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. The Company has adopted the
disclosure  provisions of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to provide pro forma net earnings and pro
forma earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in
1995 and subsequent years as if the fair-value-based method as defined in
Statement No. 123 had been applied.
The Company uses one of the most widely used option pricing models, the
Black-Scholes model Model, for purposes of valuing its stock option grants.
The Model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, it
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected
stock price volatility, expected dividend yields, the risk free interest rate,
and the expected life. Because the Company stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management opinion, the value determined by the Model is not necessarily
indicative of the ultimate value of the granted options.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could
occur if securities or contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that
then shared in the earnings of the Company.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-Lived Assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to
future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years' consolidated
financial statement amounts to conform to the current year presentation.

attributable to no additional loans securitized under the gain on sale method,
as well as the runoff of portfolios securitized and sold during prior periods.

In connection with its securitization transactions, the Company provides a
credit enhancement to the investor. The Company makes an initial cash deposit,
ranging from 3% to 6% of the initial underlying finance receivables principal
balance, into an account held by the trustee reserve account and pledges this
cash to the trust to which the finance receivables were transferred. Additional
deposits from the residual cash flow through the trustee are made to the
reserve account as necessary to attain and maintain the reserve account at a
specified percentage, ranging from 80% to 110%, of the underlying finance
receivables principal balances.
Due to the impact of the recession, the events of September 11th and the
poor auction recovery market at year end 2001, three of our trusts, 2000B, 2000C
and 2001A, reached charge-off levels for the month of December 2001 that
triggered an acceleration of rights for MBIA under the Insurance Agreements of
the respective trusts. These rights include, among other things, the ability to
transition servicing on the trusts to a third party and accelerate the cash flow
to the A bondholders until they have been paid in full. These trusts reached
these levels only for the month indicated and have dropped back below these
levels in January 2002. These trusts continue to trap cash in the reserve
accounts related to these breaches in charge-off levels.
During 2001, the Company made initial reserve account deposits totaling
approximately $106 million at the time of securitizations. The required
aggregate reserve balance for all oustanding securitizations, based upon the
original targeted percentages excluding trapped cash, was approximately $394
million at December 31, 2001. Actual balances in the reserve accounts, including
trapped cash, totaled $453 million at December 31, 2001.

6 Related Party Transactions
In January 2001, the Company entered into a $35 million senior secured loan
facility as a renewal for a $38 million senior loan facility originated in May
1999. As a condition to the $35 million senior secured loan agreement, Verde
Investments, Inc., an affiliate of Mr. Garcia, was required to invest $7 million
in the Company through a subordinated loan. The funds were placed in escrow as
additional collateral for the $35 million senior secured loan. The funds were to
be released in July 2001 if, among other conditions, the Company had at least $7
million in pre-tax income through June of 2001 and, at that time, Mr. Garcia
would have guaranteed 33% of the $35 million facility. The Company did not meet
this pre-tax income requirement for the first six months of 2001. Per the loan
agreement, Mr. Garcia was entitled to receive warrants from the Company for 15
million shares of stock, vesting over a one-year period, at an exercise price of
$450 subject to certain conditions. Also as consideration for the loan, the
Company released all options to purchase real estate that were then owned by
Verde and leased to the Company. The Company also granted Verde the option to
purchase, at book value, any or all properties currently owned by the Company,
or acquired by the Company prior to the earlier of December 31, 2001, or the
date the loan is repaid. Verde agreed to lease the properties back to the
Company, on terms similar to our current leases, if it exercises its option to
purchase any of the properties. In December 2001, Verde exercised its right to
purchase from, and lease back to the Company, six properties having a net book
value of approximately $67 million. This purchase and lease back transaction
closed in January 2002. The loan is secured by a portion of the finance
receivables in the Company securitization transactions but is subordinate to
the senior secured loan facility. The loan requires quarterly interest payments
at LIBOR plus 600 basis points and is subject to pro rata reductions if certain
conditions are met. An independent committee of the Company board reviewed and
negotiated the terms of this subordinated loan and the Company also received an
opinion from an investment banker, which deemed the loan fair from a financial
point of view both to the Company shareholders and the Company. The balance of
the note with Verde was $54 million at December 31, 2001.
In May 2001, Verde purchased one of the Company properties in Atlanta,
Georgia, pursuant to the Verde option discussed above. The property book value
was approximately $17 million. The lease is on terms consistent with other
sale-leasebacks. Verde has leased the property back to the Company under a
20-year lease, which expires May 2021.
The Note Receivable - Related Party originated from the Company December
1999 sale of its Cygnet Dealer Finance subsidiary to Cygnet Capital Corporation,
an entity controlled by Ernest C. Garcia II, Chairman and principal shareholder
of the Company. The $120 million note from Cygnet Capital Corporation has a
10-year term, with interest payable quarterly at 9%, due December 2009. The note
is secured by the capital stock of Cygnet Capital Corporation and guaranteed by
Verde Investments, Inc. Verde, an affiliate of Mr. Garcia. Under the terms
of the agreement, Mr. Garcia is allowed to reduce the principal balance up to a
maximum of $80 million by surrendering to the Company shares of Ugly Duckling
common stock valued at 98% of the average of the closing prices of the stock on
NASDAQ for the ten trading days prior to the surrender as long as Mr. Garcia
ownership interest of the Company voting stock does not fall below 15% and the
acceptance of such stock by the Company does not result in a breach of a
covenant. As a result of the going private transaction, this ability to
surrender stock for a note reduction was terminated at that time. The balance of
this loan at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $120 million.

In January 2001, the Company issued a subordinated note payable to Verde
Investments, Inc., an affiliate of Mr. Garcia. The loan, which matures in
December 2003, is secured by a portion of the finance receivables in the
Company securitization transactions but is subordinate to the senior secured
loan facility. The loan requires quarterly interest payments at LIBOR plus 600
basis points and is subject to pro rata reductions if certain conditions are
met. For a full description of all of the terms of the loan transaction see Note
6 - Related Party Transactions.
In June 2001, the Company repurchased in the open market and retired
approximately $36 million of the $175 million in subordinated debentures for
approximately $26 million. The after tax impact, net the associated unamortized
discount, of the transaction was a gain from extinguishment of debt of $03
million. The gain has been classified as Extraordinary Item - Gain on Early
Extinguishment of Debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
In connection with the 1998 issuance of the $15 million senior subordinated
notes payable, the Company issued warrants to the lenders to purchase up to
500,000 shares of the Company common stock. The warrants were valued at
approximately $900,000, had an exercise price of $1000 per share and were
exercisable at any time until the later of February 2001, or such time as the
notes have been paid in full. In September 2000, the Loan Agreement, Warrants
and Warrant Agreements between the Company and certain lenders under this Loan
Agreement were amended to: reduce the outstanding principal balance under the
Loan Agreement from $15 million to $135 million; require us to take out one of
the lenders in the facility by paying off that lender $15 million share of
the loan which occurred, and cancel the number of outstanding warrants
attributable to that portion of the loan; increase the interest rate under the
Loan Agreement to 15%; extend the term of the Loan Agreement to February 12,
2003; and provide for the repayment of principal and the corresponding reduction
of warrants under certain terms and conditions.

debentures are subordinate to all other Company indebtedness and contain certain
call provisions at the option of the Company. The debentures were issued at a
premium of approximately $39 million in excess of the market value of the shares tendered, which will be amortized as interest expense over the life of
the debentures. In connection with this exchange offer, Mr. Garcia and entities
affiliated with Mr. Garcia exchanged 294,500 shares and owns approximately
$3,020,000 in 2000 Exchange Debt.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had net operating loss of $16 million
for US federal tax purposes. Utilization of net operating loss, which begins to
expire at various times starting in 2011, may be subject to certain limitations
under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.
There was an increase of $3 million in the Valuation Allowance for the
year ended December 31, 2000. In assessing the ability to realize the Deferred
Tax Assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the Deferred Tax Assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of Deferred Tax Assets is dependent upon generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become
deductible. Management considers the reversal of Deferred Tax Liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this
assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections
for future taxable income over the periods in which the Deferred Tax Assets are
deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will
realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the established
valuation allowance at December 31, 2001. 10 Lease Commitments
The Company leases used car sales facilities, loan servicing centers,
offices, and certain office equipment from unrelated and related entities under
various operating leases that expire through December 2020. The leases require
monthly rental payments and contain various renewal options from one to ten
years. In certain instances, the Company is also responsible for occupancy and
maintenance costs, including real estate taxes, insurance, and utility costs.
Rent expense totaled $129 million, $142 million and $130 million for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

In 1998 the Company sold 17 properties to an unrelated investment company
under a sale-leaseback agreement. In December 1999, Verde acquired these 17
properties at a 100% discount for approximately $246 million. In addition, the
Company sold to Verde one property in 2001 and six properties in 2002 under
sale-leaseback agreements. The total amount paid to Verde under these leases in
2001 and 2000 was approximately $37 million and $33 million, respectively. The
Company had previously acquired the option to purchase these properties at
Verde purchase price under certain conditions. As consideration for the $7
million subordinated loan from Verde, the Company released these purchase
options and also granted Verde the option to purchase, at book value, any or all
properties currently owned by the Company, or acquired by the Company prior to
the earlier of December 31, 2001, or the date the loan is repaid. Verde agreed
to lease the properties back to the Company, on terms similar to our current

13 Stock Option Plan
In June 1995, the Company adopted a long-term incentive plan Stock Option
Plan under which it has set aside 1,800,000 shares of common stock to be
granted to employees. Options are to vest over a period to be determined by the
Board of Directors upon grant and will generally expire 6 to 10 years after the
date of grant. The options generally vest over a period of 5 years.
In August 1998, the Company stockholders approved an executive incentive
stock option plan Executive Plan. The Company has reserved 800,000 shares of
its common stock for issuance. Options granted under the plan expire ten years
after the grant date and vest 20% per year upon completion of each year of
service after the date of grant beginning 1 year after the grant date subject
to meeting additional vesting hurdles that are based on the trading price of the
Company stock and/or the achievement of certain internal performance measures.
Even if these additional vesting hurdles are not met, the options will fully
vest 7 years after the date of grant.   A summary of the aforementioned stock plan activity including the number
and weighted average price per share Average Price follows                            Stock Option Plan              Executive Plan

At December 31, 2001, there were 920,000 and 190,000 additional shares
available  for grant under the Stock Option Plan and  Executive  Plan,
respectively. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted
during 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $273, $309 and $388, respectively, on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following are the
weighted-average assumptions: 2001-- expected dividend yield 0%, risk-free
interest rate of 419%, expected volatility of 823%, and an expected life of 5
years; 2000 -- expected dividend yield 0%, risk-free interest rate of 464 expected volatility of 489%, and an expected life of 5 years; 1999 -- expected
dividend yield 0%, risk-free interest rate of 567%, expected volatility of
412%, and an expected life of 5 years.
During 1998, the Board of Directors approved separate plans to reprice the
Company outstanding stock options under the Stock Option Plan, one in January
1998 and a second in November 1998. The forfeited options had exercise prices
ranging from $975 to $2075 and were repriced at $975 or $513 per share, the
fair market value on the date of the respective repricings. Approximately
391,000 options were issued under the repricing program. The vesting period was
not affected for the options repriced under the January 1998 repricing plan.
However, the vesting period started over on the repricing date for the options
issued under the November 1998 repricing plan.   The Company applies APB Opinion 25 in accounting for its Plans, and
accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock options in
the consolidated financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation
cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under
Statement No. 123, the Company net earnings loss and earnings loss per
share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below $ in

14 Commitments and Contingencies
In connection with its securitization transactions, the Company provides a
credit enhancement to the investor. The Company maintains reserve accounts at a
specified percentage, ranging from 80% to 110%, of the underlying finance
receivables' principal balance. In the event that the cash flows generated by
the finance receivables are insufficient to pay obligations of the trust,
including principal or interest due to certificate holders or expenses of the
trust, the trustee will draw funds from the reserve account as necessary to pay
the obligations of the trust. The reserve account must be maintained at a
specified percentage of the principal balances of the finance receivables held
by the trust, which can be increased in the event delinquencies or losses exceed
specified levels. If the reserve account exceeds the specified percentage, the
trustee will release the excess cash to the Company from the pledged reserve
account. Except for releases in this manner, the cash in the reserve account is
restricted from use by the Company. Due to the impact of the recession, the
events of September 11th and the poor auction recovery market at year end 2001,
three of our trusts, 2000B, 2000C and 2001A, reached charge-off levels for the
month of December 2001 that triggered an acceleration of rights for MBIA under
the Insurance Agreements of the respective trusts. These rights include, among
other things, the ability to transition servicing on the trusts to a third party
and accelerate the cash flow to the A bondholders until they have been paid in
full. These trusts reached these levels only for the month indicated and have
dropped back below these levels in January 2002. These trusts continue to trap
cash in the reserve accounts related to these breaches in charge-off levels.
On July 18, 1997, the Company filed a Form S-3 registration statement for
the purpose of registering up to $200 million of its debt securities in one or
more series at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale. The
registration statement has been declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and may be available for future debt offerings. There can be
no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to use this registration
statement to sell debt or other securities.
The Company is involved in various claims and actions arising in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, based on consultation
with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company. No provision has been made in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements for losses, if any, which might
result from the ultimate disposition of these matters.
15 Retirement Plan
The Company has established qualified 401k retirement plan defined
contribution plan which became effective on October 1, 1995. The plan, as
amended, covers substantially all employees having no less than 90 days of
service, have attained the age of 18, and work at least 1,000 hours per year.
Participants may voluntarily contribute to the plan up to the maximum limits
established by Internal Revenue Service regulations.
Prior to January 1, 2002, the 401k plan provided a matching contribution
of Ugly Duckling common stock of up to 50% for up to the first six percent of a
participant pre-tax contributions. The matching contribution vesting and
percentage match were based upon years of service with one hundred percent
vesting and fifty percent matching at five years. After an analysis and
determination of what was in the best interests of the plan participants, all of
the shares of our stock in the 401k plan were tendered in the amended tender
offer.  Beginning January 1, 2002, the Company no longer does matching
contributions  with Ugly Duckling stock and instead provides a matching
contribution of cash in the amount of 35% of the first 6% of each employee
deferrals. Compensation expense related to this plan totaled $678,000, $566,000,
and $194,000 during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999,
respectively. 16 Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires that the Company disclose
estimated fair values for its financial instruments. The following summary
presents a description of the methodologies and assumptions used to determine
such amounts.
Limitations - Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time and
are based on relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument; they are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties, matters of
judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. These estimates do
not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at
one time the Company entire holdings of a particular instrument. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect these estimates.
Since the fair value is estimated as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the
amounts that will actually be realized or paid in settlement of the instruments
could be significantly different.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The carrying amount is estimated to be the fair
value due to the liquidity of these instruments.
Finance Receivables, Residuals in Finance Receivables Sold, Investments
Held in Trust, and Notes Receivable - The carrying amount is estimated to be the
fair value due to the relatively short maturity and repayment terms of the
portfolio as compared to similar instruments.
Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Notes Payable - The carrying amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The
terms of the Company notes payable approximate the terms in the market place
at which they could be replaced. Therefore, the fair market value approximates
the carrying value of these financial instruments.
Subordinated Notes Payable - The terms of the Company subordinated notes
payable approximate the terms in the market place at which they could be
replaced. Therefore, the fair value approximates the carrying value of these
financial instruments.
17 Subsequent Events
On January 4, 2002, Verde Investments, Inc. Verde, an affiliate of Mr.
Ernest Garcia II, the Company chairman, purchased six properties located in
Dallas, Texas,  Richmond,  Virginia,  and Los Angeles,  California,  and
simultaneously leased the properties to the Company on terms similar to the
Company current leases. This purchase was pursuant to an option granted to
Verde in partial consideration for Verde making a $70 million investment in
subordinated debt of the Company in January 2001.
In January 2002, the Company completed a second reduction in work force.
The estimated restructuring charge is approximately $08 million.
On January 16, 2002, UDC Acquisition Corp., an entity controlled by Ugly
Duckling Chairman, Mr. Ernest C. Garcia III, and Ugly Duckling President and
Chief Executive Officer Gregory B. Sullivan, successfully completed its amended
tender offer for the common stock of Ugly Duckling not owned by Mr. Garcia, Mr.
Sullivan or their affiliates. As of the expiration of the offer, UDC Acquisition
Corp. owned or controlled over 92% of the Company outstanding shares when
combined with the shares already owned by Mr. Garcia, Mr. Sullivan and their
affiliates. Because UDC Acquisition Corp. had more than 90% of the common stock
of Ugly Duckling; it completed on March 4, 2002, a short form merger with and
into Ugly Duckling without any further action by Ugly Duckling shareholders. At
the time of the merger, the Company stock was delisted from Nasdaq. All
warrants previously issued and not expired as of the closing date of the going
private transaction, March 4, 2002, were terminated upon closing. Additionally,
upon the closing of the going private transaction, all outstanding options were
terminated.
On March 18, 2002, the Company extended its revolving warehouse facility
with Greenwich Capital Financial Products, Inc. for an additional 364 days
maturing March 17, 2003. The maximum borrowing under the extended facility is
$100 million for the entire term and the 65% cap rate on the advance rate was
removed and the calculation of the warehouse advance relative to the net
securitization advance was improved by 2% of the balance of eligible loans from
the sale of used cars. 18 Business Segments
