40 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2010. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Rush Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2010, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, Rush Enterprises, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents RUSH ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company was incorporated in 1965 under the laws of the State of
Texas. The Company operates a Truck Segment. The Truck Segment operates a regional network of
Rush Truck Centers. Rush Truck Centers primarily sell commercial vehicles manufactured by
Peterbilt, International, Hino, UD, Ford, Isuzu, Mitsubishi Fuso, IC Bus or Blue Bird. Through its
strategically located network of Rush Truck Centers, the Company provides one-stop service for the
needs of its customers, including retail sales of new and used commercial vehicles, aftermarket
parts sales, service and repair facilities, financing, leasing and rental, and insurance products.
The Companys Rush Truck Centers are located in areas on or near major highways in Alabama,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for segment information. Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2009,
have been classified as Assets Held for Sale related to the sale of the construction equipment
business in September2010. Amounts in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the
years ended December31, 2009 and 2008, have been reclassified to reflect the results of the
equipment center business sold during 2010, as if the Company had classified the equipment center
business as discontinued operations for all years presented. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Rush Enterprises,
Inc. together with our consolidated subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money market instruments. The Company
considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less to be cash
equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Receivables and Repossession Losses The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and repossession losses after
considering historical loss experience and other factors that might affect the collection of
accounts receivable and the ability of customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts
sold by the Company. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by specific
identification of new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and by the first-in,
first-out method for tires, parts and accessories. An allowance is provided when it is anticipated
that cost will exceed net realizable value plus a reasonable profit margin. 46 Table of Contents Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or the term of the
lease, whichever is shorter. Provision for depreciation of property and equipment is calculated
primarily on a straight-line basis. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the
active construction period of major capital projects. Capitalized interest, when incurred, is added
to the cost of underlying assets and is amortized over the estimated useful life of such assets.
The Company capitalized interest of $05million related to major capital projects during 2010.
The cost, accumulated depreciation and amortization and estimated useful lives are summarized as

As of December31, 2010, the Company had $535million in lease and rental vehicles under various
capital leases included in property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $126
million. The Company recorded depreciation expense of $396million and amortization expense of
$63million for the year ended December31, 2010, and depreciation expense of $361million and
amortization expense of $46million for the year ended December31, 2009. Depreciation and
amortization of vehicles related to lease and rental operations is included in lease and rental
cost of products sold. Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets
acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method. The Company does not
amortize goodwill, but tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or when
indications of potential impairment exist. These indicators would include a significant change in
operating performance, or a planned sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business,
among other factors. The Company tests for goodwill impairment utilizing a fair value approach at
the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, for which discrete financial
information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company has deemed its
reporting unit to be its operating segment, the Truck Segment, which is the level at which segment
management regularly reviews operating results and makes resource allocation decisions. The impairment test for goodwill involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its
carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. The second step includes
hypothetically valuing all the tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit as if the
reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. Then, the implied fair value of the
reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying
amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, the Company
would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the carrying
amount. The Company determines the fair values calculated in an impairment test using the
discounted cash flow method, which requires assumptions and estimates regarding future revenue,
expenses and cash flow projections. The analysis is based upon available information regarding
expected future cash flows of each reporting unit discounted at rates consistent with the cost of
capital specific to the reporting unit. 47 Table of Contents An interim evaluation of goodwill was required during the second quarter of 2009 due to General
Motors decision to terminate production of medium-duty GMC trucks, which resulted in the
winding-down of the Companys medium-duty GMC truck franchises. The goodwill allocation was based
on the relative fair values of the medium-duty GMC truck franchises and the portion of the
Companys Truck Segment remaining. The Companys Truck Segment recorded a non-cash charge of $08
million related to the impairment of the goodwill of its medium-duty GMC truck franchises. See
Note 18 for further discussion of the wind-down of the Companys medium-duty GMC truck franchise
agreements. Goodwill was tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2010 and no impairment write down
was required. However, the Company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might
adversely affect the reported value of goodwill in the future. Such events may include, but are
not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions or
another significant decrease in general economic conditions in the United States. The following table sets forth the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the Company for
the period ended December31, 2010

Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required to determine the provisions for income taxes and to
determine whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. When it is
more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be
realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets
that are determined not to be realizable. Accordingly, the facts and financial circumstances
impacting state deferred income tax assets are reviewed quarterly and managements judgment is
applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required, if any, in any given period. In determining our provision for income taxes, the Company uses an annual effective income tax rate
based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax
rates. The effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax
audits. The Company adjusts its annual effective income tax rate as additional information on
outcomes or events becomes available. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax
laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. The Companys income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by U.S.
federal, state and local tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding the Companys
tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions. At any one time, multiple tax
years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities. In evaluating the tax benefits
associated with the Companys various tax filing positions, it records a tax benefit for uncertain
tax positions. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which the Company has
established a liability, is audited and effectively settled. The Company adjusts its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which it determines the issue is effectively settled
with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to
examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. The Company includes its
liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, in accrued liabilities on the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet and in income tax expense in the Companys Consolidated
Statement of Income. Additionally, despite the Companys belief that its tax return positions are consistent with
applicable tax law, management believes that certain positions may be challenged by taxing
authorities. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some
partial adjustment reached through negotiations. 48 Table of Contents Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted ASC topic 740-10, Income Taxes. ASC topic 740-10
clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by
prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. ASC topic 740-10 provides guidance regarding the recognition,
measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial statements of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on a tax return. ASC topic 740-10 requires that only income tax benefits that
meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on
its effective date. The Companys income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and
changes to reserves that it considers appropriate, as well as related interest. Unfavorable
settlement of any particular issue would require use of the Companys cash and a charge to income
tax expense. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the
time of resolution. Revenue Recognition Policies Income on the sale of a vehicle a unit is recognized when the seller and customer execute a
purchase contract, delivery has occurred and there are no significant uncertainties related to
financing or collectibility. Finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over the
period of the respective finance contract, based on the effective interest rate method, if the
finance contract is retained by the Company. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, no finance contracts were
retained for any significant length of time by the Company but were generally sold, with limited
recourse, to certain finance companies concurrent with the sale of the related unit. Gain or loss
is recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance contracts to the finance companies, net
of a provision for estimated repossession losses and early repayment penalties. Lease and rental
income is recognized over the period of the related lease or rental agreement. Contingent rental
income is recognized when it is earned. Parts and services revenue is earned at the time the
Company sells the parts to its customers or at the time the Company completes the service work
order related to service provided to the customers unit. Payments received on prepaid maintenance
plans are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and recognized as income when the maintenance
is performed. Cost of Sales For the Companys new and used commercial vehicle operations and its parts operations, cost of
sales consists primarily of the Companys actual purchase price, less manufacturers incentives,
for new and used commercial vehicles and parts. The Company is subject to a chargeback of
manufacturer incentives for commercial vehicles that are not sold to the customer for which they
were ordered. The Company records a liability for a potential chargeback of manufacturer
incentives in its financial statements. For the Companys service and body shop operations,
technician labor cost is the primary component of cost of sales. For the Companys rental and
leasing operations, cost of sales consists primarily of depreciation and amortization, rent, and
interest expense on the lease and rental fleet owned and leased by the Company, and the maintenance
cost of the lease and rental fleet. There are no costs of sales associated with the Companys
finance and insurance revenue or other revenue. Taxes Assessed by a Governmental Authority The Company accounts for sales taxes assessed by a governmental authority, that are directly
imposed on a revenue-producing transaction, on a net excluded from revenues basis. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of incentive-based compensation for
sales, finance and general management personnel, salaries for administrative personnel and expenses
for rent, marketing, insurance, utilities, shipping and handling costs and other general operating
purposes. Stock Based Compensation The Company applies the provisions of ASC topic 718-10, Compensation Stock Compensation, which
requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards
made to employees and directors including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock and
employee stock purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan based on estimated fair values. 49 Table of Contents The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based
payment awards on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately
expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Companys
Consolidated Statements of Income. Stock-based compensation expense recognized is based on the fair value of the portion of
share-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Compensation
expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option
method. As stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income is
based on awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures.
Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The Companys determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using
an option-pricing model is affected by the Companys stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited
to, the Companys expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and
projected stock option exercise behaviors. Option-pricing models were developed for use in
estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully
transferable. Because the Companys stock options have certain characteristics that are
significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can
materially affect the estimated value, in managements opinion, the existing valuation models may
not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the Companys stock options. Although the
fair value of stock options is determined in accordance with ASC topic 718-10 using an
option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a market
transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller. The following table reflects the weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during each
period using the Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted-average

$562 The Company computes its historical stock price volatility in accordance with ASC topic 718-10.
The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The dividend yield assumption is based
on the Companys history and expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life of stock options
represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and marketing expense was $29million for
2010, $21million for 2009 and $36million for 2008. Advertising and marketing expense is
included in selling, general and administrative expense. Accounting for Internal Use Software The Companys accounting policy with respect to accounting for computer software developed or
obtained for internal use is consistent with ASC topic 350-40 which provides guidance on accounting
for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and identifies
characteristics of internal-use software. The Company has capitalized software costs, including
capitalized interest, of approximately $367million at December31, 2010, and $285million at
December31, 2009. 50 Table of Contents Insurance The Company is partially self-insured for a portion of the claims related to its property and
casualty insurance programs, requiring it to make estimates regarding expected losses to be
incurred. The Company engages a third party administrator to assess any open claims and the
Company adjusts its accrual accordingly on an annual basis. The Company is also partially
self-insured for a portion of the claims related to its workers compensation and medical insurance
programs. The Company uses actuarial information provided from third party administrators to
calculate an accrual for claims incurred, but not reported, and for the remaining portion of claims
that have been reported. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risk. The types
of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of cash flows and changes in the fair value
of the Companys financial instruments caused by movements in interest rates. The Company assesses
hedge effectiveness at the inception and during the term of each hedge. Derivatives are reported at
fair value on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December31, 2010, the Company had an aggregate $450million notional amount of interest rate
swap contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to pay fixed rates of interest and
receive a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. The fixed interest rates specified in the interest
rate swap contracts become effective on or about January1, 2012. 3. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various manufacturers of vehicles
Manufacturers. These agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the Company to stock,
sell at retail and service commercial vehicles and products of the Manufacturers in the Companys
defined market. The agreements allow the Company to use the Manufacturers names, trade symbols and
intellectual property and expire as follows   
Distributor
Expiration Dates   Peterbilt
April 2011 through July 2013   International
May 2013 through May 2015   Autocar

May 2015 These agreements, as well as agreements with various other Manufacturers, impose a number of
restrictions and obligations on the Company, including restrictions on a change in control of the
Company and the maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of these
restrictions could result in the loss of the Companys right to purchase the Manufacturers
products and use the Manufacturers trademarks. The Company purchases its new Peterbilt vehicles and most of its parts from PACCAR, the maker of
Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new
Peterbilt trucks accounted for approximately 771% of the Companys new vehicle sales for the year
ended December31, 2010, and 805% of the Companys new vehicle sales for the year ended December
31, 2009. 51 Table of Contents Primary Lenders The Company purchases its new and used commercial vehicle inventories with the assistance of floor
plan financing programs. The Companys floor plan financing agreements provide that the occurrence
of certain events will be
considered events of default. There were no known events of default as of December31, 2010. In
the event that the Companys floor plan financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship with
any of its current primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain similar financing
from other sources. Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or
alternative financing if necessary. The Companys long-term real estate debt agreements and floor plan financing arrangements require
the Company to satisfy various financial ratios such as the debt to worth ratio, leverage ratio,
the fixed charge coverage ratio and certain requirements for tangible net worth and GAAP net worth.
At December31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants. The Company does not
anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable future. Concentrations of Credit Risks Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places
its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers to be quality financial institutions. As of
December31, 2010, the Company had deposits in excess of federal insurance protection totaling
approximately $425million. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals and by selling a majority of its trade
receivables without recourse. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Companys customer
base, thus spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of the Companys business, however, is
concentrated in the United States commercial vehicle markets and related aftermarkets. The Company generally sells finance contracts it enters into with customers to finance the purchase
of commercial vehicles to third parties. These finance contracts are sold both with and without
recourse. A majority of the Companys finance contracts are sold without recourse. The Company
provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and a reserve for repossession losses related to
finance contracts sold. Historically, the Companys allowance and reserve have covered losses
inherent in these receivables. 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Companys accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following in thousands

Allowance for Doubtful Receivables The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible warranty receivables. The Company evaluates the
collectibility of its warranty claims receivable based on a combination of factors, including aging
and correspondence with the applicable manufacturer. Management reviews the warranty claims
receivable aging and adjusts the allowance based on historical experience. The Company records
charge-offs related to warranty receivables on an as-needed basis. The Company sells a majority of its customer accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third
party that is responsible for qualifying the customer for credit at the point of sale. If the
third party approves the customer for credit, then the third party assumes all credit risk related
to the transaction. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables after considering
historical loss experience and other factors that might affect the collection of accounts
receivable. 53 Table of Contents Inventory The Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow moving parts. The reserve is reviewed and, if
necessary, adjustments are made on a quarterly basis. The Company relies on historical information
to support its reserve. Once the inventory is written down, the Company does not adjust the reserve
balance until the inventory is sold. The valuation for new and used commercial vehicle inventory is based on specific identification. A
detail of new and used commercial vehicle is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments to the value
of specific units are made on a quarterly basis. 7. FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable Floor plan notes are financing agreements to facilitate the Companys purchase of new and used
commercial vehicles. These notes are collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts
receivable arising from the sale thereof. The Companys wholesale security agreement with GE
Capital has the interest rate benchmarked to LIBOR, as defined in the agreement. The interest rate applicable to the GE Capital wholesale security agreement was approximately 141%
as of December31, 2010. The Companys weighted average interest rate for floor plan notes payable
was 109% for the year ended December31, 2010, and 128% for the year ended December31, 2009.
The wholesale security agreement allowed for prepayments with monthly adjustments to the interest
due on outstanding advances, which reduced the Companys weighted average interest rate. On December31, 2010, the Company entered into a new credit agreement with GE Capital. The
interest rate under the new credit agreement is LIBOR plus 295%. The GE Capital credit agreement
allows for prepayment of the inventory loans, up to 65% of the aggregate inventory loans
outstanding, with monthly adjustments to the interest due. Amounts borrowed under the agreement
are due when the related commercial vehicle inventory collateralis sold and the sales proceeds
are collected by the Company. This agreement may be modified, suspended or terminated by the
lender as described in Note 3. The Company finances substantially all of the purchase price of its new commercial vehicle
inventory, and the loan value of its used commercial vehicle inventory under the credit agreement
with GE Capital, under which GE Capital pays the manufacturer directly with respect to new
commercial vehicles. On December31, 2010, the Company had approximately $2299million
outstanding under its credit agreement with GE Capital. Navistar Financial Corporation offers a floor plan program that provides an interest free financing
period, which varies depending on the commercial vehicle purchased. If the commercial vehicle
financed by Navistar is not sold within the interest free finance period, the Company transfers the
financed commercial vehicle to the GE Capital credit agreement. On December31, 2010, the Company
had approximately $79million outstanding under its floor plan program with Navistar Financial
Corporation. Pursuant to the disposition of Rush Equipment Centers, the Companys floor plan agreement with
Chase and the dealership agreement John Deere were terminated. At December31, 2010, there was not
a balance outstanding under the floor plan agreement with Chase or the dealership agreement John
Deere. 54 Table of Contents Assets pledged as collateral as of December31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows in thousands

The interest rates on the Companys variable interest rate notes are based on LIBOR. The interest
rates on the notes range from approximately 155% to 3375% on December31, 2010. Payments on the
notes range from $1,910 to $50,300 per month, plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from
December2012 to September2015. 55 Table of Contents The Companys fixed interest rate notes are with financial institutions and had interest rates that
ranged from approximately 304% to 860% on December31, 2010. Payments on the notes range from
$302 to $76,196 per month, plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from January2011, to
May2019. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used primarily to acquire land, buildings and
improvements, transportation equipment and leasing vehicles. The notes are secured by the assets
acquired with the proceeds of such notes. The Companys long-term real estate debt agreements and floor plan arrangement require the Company
to satisfy various financial ratios such as the debt to worth ratio, leverage ratio, the fixed
charge coverage ratio and certain requirements for tangible net worth and GAAP net worth. At
December31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants related to debt secured by
real estate. The Company does not anticipate any breach of the covenants in the foreseeable
future. 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE Certain methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating the fair value of financial
instruments at December31, 2010. The carrying value of current assets and current liabilities
approximates the fair value due to the short maturity of these items. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on secondary market indicators. Since the
Companys debt is not quoted, estimates are based on each obligations characteristics, including
remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization schedule and
liquidity. The carrying amount approximates fair value. If investments are deemed to be impaired, the Company determines whether the impairment is
temporary or other than temporary. If the impairment is deemed to be temporary, the Company
records an unrealized loss in other comprehensive income. If the impairment is deemed other than
temporary, the Company records the impairment in the Companys consolidated statement of
operations. In prior years, the Company invested in interest-bearing short-term investments primarily
consisting of investment-grade auction rate securities classified as available-for-sale and
reported at fair value. These types of investments were designed to provide liquidity through an
auction process that reset the applicable interest rates at predetermined periods ranging from 1 to
35days. This reset mechanism was intended to allow existing investors to continue to own their
respective interest in the auction rate security or to gain immediate liquidity by selling their
interests at par. As a result of the liquidity issues experienced in the global capital markets, auctions for
investment grade securities held by the Company have failed. An auction fails when there is
insufficient demand. However, a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer. The
auction rate securities continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the underlying
security; however, liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time
as other markets for these investments develop. The Company has the intent and ability to hold
these auction rate securities until liquidity returns to the market. The Company does not believe
that the lack of liquidity relating to its auction rate securities will have a material impact on
its ability to fund operations. As of December31, 2010 and December31, 2009, the Company held $76million of auction rate
securities with underlying tax-exempt municipal bonds that mature in 2030. These bonds have credit
wrap insurance and a credit rating of A by Standard Poors. The Company believes that the credit quality and fair value of the auction rate securities it holds
has not been negatively impacted; therefore, no impairment charges have been recorded as of
December31, 2010. As of December31, 2010, the Company has valued these investments at fair
value, which approximates cost. The Company used observable inputs to determine fair value,
including consideration of broker quotes, the overall quality of the underlying municipality, the
credit quality of the insurance company, as well as successful subsequent auctions. Accordingly,
the Company has considered this fair value to be a Level 2 valuation under ASC 820-10, Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures. If the credit quality of these investments deteriorates, or adverse
developments occur in the bond insurance market, the Company may be required to record an
impairment charge on these investments in the future. 56 Table of Contents Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company has entered into swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in
interest rates on its floating-rate debt instruments. Swap agreements that hedge exposures to
changes in interest rates expose us to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the potential
failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the swap agreement. The Company attempts
to minimize this risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. Market risk
is the potential adverse effect on the value of the swap agreement that results from a decline in
interest rates. The market
risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters
that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. At December31, 2010, the Company had an aggregate $450million notional amount of interest rate
swap contracts, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, to pay fixed rates of interest and
receive a floating interest rate based on LIBOR. The fixed interest rates specified in the interest
rate swap contracts become effective on or about January1, 2012. The Companys interest rate
swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses will be recognized in interest
expense, if they occur. Amounts to be received or paid under the contracts will be recognized as
interest expense over the life of the contracts. The Company did not have any interest rate swap
contracts in place as of December31, 2009. There was no ineffectiveness for these swaps during
the year ended December31, 2010. The fair value of cash flow swaps is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows,
determined on the basis of forward interest rates and present value factors. As such, the carrying
amounts for these swaps are designated to be level 2 fair values and totaled $04million as of
December31, 2010. The carrying value of these swaps is included in Other Long-Term Liabilities on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2010. As of December31, 2010 the Company was party to derivative financial instruments, as described in

57 Table of Contents 10. LEASING ACTIVITIES Vehicle Leases as Lessee The Company leases vehicles, as lessee, primarily over periods ranging from one to ten years under
operating lease and capital lease arrangements. Generally, the Company is required to incur all
operating costs and pay a minimum rental. The Company guarantees the residual value of vehicles
under operating lease and capital lease arrangements. At December31, 2010, the Company guaranteed
vehicle residual values of $49million under operating lease arrangements and $174million under
capital lease arrangements. Historically, the Company purchases these vehicles at the end of the
lease term and recognizes a gain on the subsequent sale of the vehicle. The residual values are
not reflected in the future minimum lease payments for operating leases. Vehicle lease expenses
were approximately $38million for the year ended December31, 2010, $38million for the year
ended December31, 2009, and $44million for the year ended December31, 2008. As discussed below, these vehicles are then subleased by the Company to customers under various
agreements. Future minimum sublease rentals to be received by the Company under non-cancelable
subleases, as described below, are $485million. Future minimum lease payments under capital and non-cancelable vehicle leases as of December31,
2010, are as follows in thousands

Customer Vehicle Leases as Lessor The Company leases both owned and leased trucks to customers primarily over periods of one to ten
years under operating lease arrangements. These leases require a minimum rental payment and a
contingent rental payment based on mileage. Rental income during the year ended December31, 2010,
consisted of minimum rental payments of approximately $534million and contingent rental payments
of $75million. Rental income during the year ended December31, 2009, consisted of minimum
rental payments of approximately $472million and contingent rental payments of $63million.

10% of their base earnings toward the semi-annual purchase of the Companys ClassA common stock.
The employees purchase price is 85% of the lesser of the closing price of the ClassA common stock
on the first business day or the last business day of the semi-annual offering period, as reported
by The NASDAQ Global Select MarketSM. Employees may purchase shares having a
fair market value of up to $25,000 measured as of the first day of each semi-annual offering
period for each calendar year. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, there are approximately
527,000 shares remaining of the 900,000 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock that have been
reserved for issuance. The Company issued 65,757 shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
during the year ended December31, 2010 and 91,355 shares during the year ended December31, 2009.

plan to include ClassA common stock awards. The Director Plan was also amended on May18, 2010 to
reduce the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by 1,000,000 shares of ClassA
common stock. The Director Plan is designed to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors. Prior

ClassA common stock upon their respective date of appointment and each year on the date that they
are elected or reelected by the shareholders to serve on the Board of Directors. Each option has a
ten year term from the grant date and vested immediately. Beginning in 2008, each non-employee
director received a grant of the Companys ClassA common stock equivalent to a compensation value
of $125,000 and in 2009 the compensation value was reduced to $100,000. Each non-employee director
received a grant of 8,756 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock in 2009. In 2010, two
non-employee directors received a grant of 6,527 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock and
three non-employee directors received a grant of 4,242 shares of the Companys ClassA common stock

unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Plan and the 2007
Incentive Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 30
years. 61 Table of Contents Defined Contribution Plan The Company has a defined contribution plan the Rush 401k Plan, which is available to all
Company employees and the employees of certain affiliates. Each employee who has completed 90days
of continuous service is entitled to enter
the Rush 401k Plan on the first day of the following month. Participating employees may contribute
from 1% to 50% of total gross compensation. However, certain higher paid employees are limited to a
maximum contribution of 15% of total gross compensation. In March2009, the Company discontinued
its matching contributions to the Rush 401k plan. On April1, 2010 the Company reinstated its
matching contributions. For the first 10% of an employees contribution, the Company, at its
discretion, may contribute an amount equal to 5% of the employees contributions for those
employees with less than five years of service and an amount equal to 10% of the employees
contributions for those employees with more than five years of service. The Company incurred
expenses related to the Rush 401k Plan of approximately $04million during the year ended December
31, 2010, $06million during the year ended December31, 2009, and $34million during the year
ended December31, 2008. Deferred Compensation Plan On November6, 2010 the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc.
Deferred Compensation Plan the Deferred Compensation Plan wherein selected employees and
directors may elect to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The Deferred Compensation Plan
also provides the Company with the discretion to make matching contributions to participants
accounts. The Company has established a rabbi trust to finance obligations under the Deferred
Compensation Plan with corporate-owned variable life insurance contracts. Participants are 100%
vested in their respective deferrals and the earnings thereon. The first deferral election period
began on January1, 2011. The Company currently does not provide any postretirement benefits nor does it provide any post
employment benefits. 12. STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN Stock Repurchase Plan On July22, 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing
the Company to repurchase, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $20,000,000 of its shares of
ClassA common stock and/or ClassB common stock. Repurchases will be made at times and in amounts
as the Company deems appropriate and will be made through open market transactions, privately
negotiated transactions and other lawful means. The manner, timing and amount of any repurchases
will be determined by the Company based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and
other factors, including those related to the ownership requirements of its dealership agreements
with manufacturers it represents. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date and may be
suspended or discontinued at any time. While the stock repurchase program does not obligate the
Company to acquire any particular amount or class of common stock, the Company anticipates that it
will be repurchasing primarily shares of its ClassB common stock. During the year ended December31, 2008, the Company repurchased 1,639,843 shares of ClassB common
stock at a cost of $179million. The Company is holding the repurchased shares of the common
stock as treasury stock and is accounting for the treasury stock pursuant to the cost method. The
Company includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders equity. On November6, 2010, the
Board of Directors of the Company approved the termination of the stock repurchase program. 13. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS were computed by dividing income from continuing operations by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
differs from basic EPS due to the assumed conversions of potentially dilutive options and
restricted shares that were outstanding during the period. The Companys ClassA common stock and
ClassB common stock have equal claims on earnings of the Company. The following is a
reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted per share
computations for income from continuing operations. 62 Table of Contents

The Companys various state net operating loss carry forwards expire from 2011 through 2024. 64 Table of Contents The Company included accruals for unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $15million as a
component of accrued liabilities as of December31, 2010, and $18million as of December31, 2009.
The unrecognized tax benefits of $15million at December31, 2010, and $18million as of
December31, 2009, if recognized, would impact the Companys effective tax rate. An unfavorable
settlement would require a charge to income tax expense and a favorable resolution would be
recognized as a reduction to income tax expense. As of December31, 2010, the Company accrued
interest of $130,000 related to unrecognized tax benefits in the current provision for income
taxes. No amounts were accrued for penalties. The Company does not anticipate a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in
the next 12months. As of December31, 2010, the tax years ended December31, 2008 through 2010
remained subject to audit by federal tax authorities and the tax years ended December31, 2006
through 2010, remained subject to audit by state tax authorities. A reconciliation of the change in the unrecognized tax benefits from January1, 2008, to December

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance companies for certain notes initiated on behalf of
such finance companies related to the sale of commercial vehicles. The majority of finance
contracts are sold without recourse against the Company. A majority of the Companys liability
related to finance contracts sold with recourse is generally limited to 5% to 20% of the
outstanding amount of each note initiated on behalf of the finance company. The Company provides
for an allowance for repossession losses and early repayment penalties that it may be liable for
under finance contracts sold without recourse. The Company is involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims or
proceedings to which the Company is a party would have a material adverse effect on the Companys
financial position or results of operations; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of
litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding
would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations for the fiscal
period in which such resolution occurred. In 2006, the Company signed an agreement with Titan Technology Partners to implement SAP enterprise
software and a new SAP dealership management system. The cost of the SAP software and
implementation is estimated at approximately $390million, of which $362million was expended at
December31, 2010. 16. ACQUISITIONS All of the following acquisitions, unless otherwise noted, were considered business combinations

18. MEDIUM-DUTY GMC TRUCK FRANCHISES During the second quarter of 2009, General Motors made the decision to terminate its medium-duty
GMC truck production and wind-down the Companys medium-duty GMC truck franchises, which forced the
Company to take a $67million pre-tax asset impairment charge. The impairment charge was offset
by $18million in assistance from General Motors. In the second quarter of 2009, this impairment
charge resulted in a net charge to cost of sales of $40million, a net charge to SGA expense of
$01million and a charge to amortization expense of $08million. During the third and fourth
quarters of 2009, the Company adjusted the estimated impairment charge related to the medium-duty
GMC truck and parts inventories, which resulted in a net credit to cost of sales of $19million. 19. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to comprehensive income in

21. SEGMENTS The Company currently has one reportable business segment, the Truck segment. The Truck segment
operates a network of commercial vehicle dealerships that provide an integrated one-stop source for
the commercial vehicle needs of its customers, including retail sales of new and used commercial
vehicles; aftermarket parts, service and body shop facilities; and a wide array of financial
services, including the financing of new and used commercial vehicle purchases, insurance products
and truck leasing and rentals. The commercial vehicle dealerships are deemed as a single reporting
unit because they have similar economic characteristics. The Companys chief operating decision
maker considers the entire Truck segment, not individual dealerships, when making decisions about
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The Construction Equipment segment is no longer reported as a separate business segment due to the
sale of Companys construction equipment business. See Note 17 for further discussion of the sale
of the construction equipment business. The assets of the construction equipment business have
been included in the All Other segment assets in the table below for 2009 and 2008. 70 Table of Contents The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on income from continuing
operations before income taxes not including extraordinary items. The Company accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to
third parties, that is, at current market prices. There were no material intersegment sales during
the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The following table contains summarized information about reportable segment revenue, segment
income or loss from continuing operations and segment assets for the periods ended December31,
2010, 2009 and 2008 in thousands
