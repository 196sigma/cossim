REPORT OF MANAGEMENT 
Managements Report on Financial Information and Procedures 
The accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required. 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control
systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent
limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance
of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31,2011 to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. 
Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.

The effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31,2011 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein. 
Managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31,2011 excluded the five acquisitions we completed in 2011. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in managements report on internal control
over financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within twelve months of managements evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 28% of our consolidated assets at December31,2011 and 09% of our
consolidated revenues for the year ended December31,2011.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.: 
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash
flows and equity, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31,2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December31,2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31,2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. As described in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, management has excluded its 2011 acquisitions from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December31,2011 because these acquisitions were acquired by the Company through purchase business
combinations during 2011. We have also excluded the Companys 2011 acquisitions from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The 2011 acquisitions of the Company and its related subsidiaries are wholly owned subsidiaries of the
Company and have total assets and revenues which represent approximately 28% and 09%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December31,2011.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta
Services, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which are also referred to as its operating units. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quantas investments in joint ventures, which are either
consolidated or proportionately consolidated, as discussed in the following summary of significant accounting policies. Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta owns more than a 20% interest and do not have a controlling interest are
accounted for using the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the
financial statements are published and the reported amount of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records
the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on Quantas beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with
respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates are primarily used in Quantas assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of assets, fair
value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other 
81 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
intangibles and long-lived asset impairments, equity investments, loan receivables, purchase price allocations, liabilities for self-insured and other claims, multi-employer pension plan
withdrawal liabilities, revenue recognition for construction contracts and fiber optic licensing, share-based compensation, operating results of reportable segments, as well as the provision benefit for income taxes and the calculation of
uncertain tax positions. 
Reclassifications 
Certain reclassifications have been made in prior years segment
disclosures to conform to classifications used in the current year. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Quanta had cash and cash equivalents of $3153 million and $5392
million as of December31,2011 and 2010. Cash consisting of interest-bearing demand deposits is carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Quanta considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents, which are carried at fair value. At December31,2011 and 2010, cash equivalents were $1659 million and $4608 million, which consisted primarily of money market mutual funds and investment grade
commercial paper and are discussed further in Fair Value Measurements below. As of December31,2011 and 2010, cash and cash equivalents held in domestic bank accounts were approximately $2309 million and $5096 million
and cash and cash equivalents held in foreign bank accounts were approximately $844 million and $296 million. 
Current and Long-Term Accounts and Notes Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
Quanta provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection of an account
or note receivable is considered doubtful, and receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible. Inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including, among
others, the customers access to capital, the customers willingness or ability to pay, general economic and market conditions and the ongoing relationship with the customer. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after
30days but does not generally include delinquent accounts in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts unless the accounts receivable have been outstanding for at least 90 days. In addition to balances that have been outstanding for
90days or more, Quanta also includes accounts receivable balances that relate to customers in bankruptcy or with other known difficulties in its analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Under certain circumstances such as foreclosures
or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. Material changes in Quantas customers business or cash flows, which may be impacted by negative economic and market
conditions, could affect its ability to collect amounts due from them. As of December31,2011 and 2010, Quanta had total allowances for doubtful accounts of approximately $38 million and $73 million, of which approximately $38 million
and $61 million was included as a reduction of net current accounts receivable. Should customers experience financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, or should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other
workout situations fail to materialize, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided. The balances billed but not paid by customers pursuant to retainage provisions in certain contracts are generally due upon completion of the contracts and acceptance by the customer. Based on
Quantas experience with similar contracts in recent years, the majority of the retainage balances at each balance sheet date are expected to be collected within the next twelve months. Current retainage balances as of
December31,2011 and 2010 were approximately $1171 million and $1194 million and are included in accounts receivable. Retainage

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
balances with settlement dates beyond the next twelve months are included in other assets, net, and as of December31,2011 and 2010 were $283 million and $80 million. 
Within accounts receivable, Quanta recognizes unbilled receivables in circumstances such as when: revenues have been
earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date; costs have been incurred but are yet to be billed under cost-reimbursement type contracts; or amounts arise from routine lags in billing for
example, work completed one month but not billed until the next month. These balances do not include revenues accrued for work performed under fixed-price contracts as these amounts are recorded as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
on uncompleted contracts. At December31,2011 and 2010, the balances of unbilled receivables included in accounts receivable were approximately $1408 million and $1035 million. 
Inventories 
Inventories consist primarily of parts and supplies held for use in the ordinary
course of business, which are valued by Quanta at the lower of cost or market as determined by using either the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet
installed which are valued using the specific identification method. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is
computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of
the asset. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was approximately $1161 million, $1075 million and $869 million for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Quanta capitalizes costs associated with internally developed or constructed assets primarily associated with fiber optic
licensing networks and software systems for internal applications. Capitalized costs include external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining internal-use assets, as well as payroll and payroll-related expenses for
employees who are directly associated with and devote time to placing the assets into service. Capitalization of such costs is recorded to construction work-in-process beginning when the preliminary project stage is complete and ceases no later than
the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose, at which point in time the asset is placed into service. As of December31,2011 and 2010, approximately $141 million and $113 million related
to fiber optic licensing networks and $80 million and $55 million associated with internally developed software systems were recorded in construction work-in-process. These capitalized costs are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
economic useful life of the asset, beginning when the asset is ready for its intended use. Capitalized costs are included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and
betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the adjusted remaining useful life of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, fair value would be
determined by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset and comparing it to the 
83 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
assets carrying amount to determine if an impairment of such asset is necessary. The effect of any impairment would be to expense the difference between the fair value of such asset and its
carrying value in the period incurred. During 2010 and 2009, approximately $82 million and $78 million in
net property and equipment was reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets as they were deemed to be assets held for sale. In conjunction with this assessment, approximately $01 million and $45 million in net losses from the
impairment of assets held for sale were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2010 and 2009. During 2011, there was no property and equipment classified as assets held for sale. 
Other Assets, Net 
Other assets, net consists primarily of equity investments, debt issuance
costs, long term receivables, non-current inventory, refundable security deposits for leased properties and insurance claims in excess of deductibles that are due from Quantas insurers. 
Debt Issuance Costs 
Capitalized debt issuance costs related to Quantas credit facility and any other
debt outstanding at a given balance sheet date are included in other assets, net and are amortized into interest expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the debt issuance costs, which Quanta
believes approximates the effective interest rate method. During 2011, Quanta incurred $41 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendment and restatement of its credit facility and recorded a $03 million charge to interest expense for the
write-off of a portion of the debt issuance costs related to the prior facility. As of December31,2011 and 2010, capitalized debt issuance costs were $44 million and $29 million, with accumulated amortization of $04 million and $21
million. For the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, amortization expense related to capitalized debt issuance costs was $09 million, $06 million and $09 million, respectively. 
Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its
acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment using a two-step fair value-based test, which Quanta performs at the operating unit level. Each of Quantas operating units is organized into one of three internal
divisions, which are closely aligned with Quantas reportable segments, based on the predominant type of work performed by the operating unit at the point in time the divisional designation is made. Because separate measures of assets and cash
flows are not produced or utilized by management to evaluate segment performance, Quantas impairment assessments of its goodwill do not include any consideration of assets and cash flows by reportable segment. As a result, Quanta has
determined that its individual operating units represent its reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairments. Quantas goodwill impairment assessment is performed annually at year-end, or more frequently if events or circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be impaired. For instance, a decrease
in Quantas market capitalization below book value, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of goodwill associated with one or all of
its reporting units. The first step of the two-step fair value-based test involves comparing the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its
fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the 
84 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
reporting units goodwill to the implied fair value of its goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recorded as a
reduction to goodwill with a corresponding charge to operating expense. Quanta determines the fair value of
its reporting units using a weighted combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches, with heavier weighting on the discounted cash flow method, as in managements opinion, this method
currently results in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Such estimates and assumptions include
revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions, among others. Quanta believes the estimates and assumptions used in its impairment assessments are reasonable and based on
available market information, but variations in any of the assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value and determinations of whether or not an impairment is indicated. 
Under the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each
reporting unit, discounted to present value using risk-adjusted industry discount rates, which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. Cash flow projections are
derived from budgeted amounts and operating forecasts typically a two-year model plus an estimate of later period cash flows, all of which are evaluated by management. Subsequent period cash flows are developed for each reporting unit using growth
rates that management believes are reasonably likely to occur along with a terminal value derived from the reporting units earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. The EBITDA multiples for each reporting unit
are based on trailing twelve-month comparable industry data. Under the market multiple and market
capitalization approaches, Quanta determines the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units by applying transaction multiples to each reporting units projected EBITDA and then averaging that estimate with similar historical
calculations using either a one, two or three year average. For the market capitalization approach, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be received in a sale of the reporting unit in an orderly
transaction between market participants. The projected cash flows and estimated levels of EBITDA by reporting
unit were used to determine fair value under the three approaches discussed herein. The following table presents the significant estimates used by management in determining the fair values of Quantas reporting units at

impairment test may indicate an implied fair value that is substantially similar to the reporting units carrying value. Such similarities in value are generally an indication 
85 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
that managements estimates of future cash flows associated with the recently acquired reporting unit remain relatively consistent with the assumptions that were used to derive its initial
fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2011, a goodwill impairment analysis was performed for each of Quantas reporting units, which indicated that the implied fair value of each of Quantas reporting units was substantially in excess
of their carrying value other than those recently acquired reporting units. Following the analysis, management concluded that no impairment was indicated at any reporting unit. As discussed generally above, when evaluating the 2011 step one
impairment test results, management considered many factors in determining whether or not an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit was reasonably likely to occur in future periods, including future market conditions and the economic
environment in which Quantas reporting units were operating. Additionally, management considered the sensitivity of its fair value estimates to changes in certain valuation assumptions, and after giving consideration to at least a 10% decrease
in the fair value of each of Quantas reporting units, the results of the assessment at December31, 2011 did not change. However, circumstances such as market declines, unfavorable economic conditions, the loss of a major customer or
other factors could impact the valuation of goodwill in future periods. The goodwill analysis performed for
each reporting unit was based on estimates and industry comparables obtained from the electric power, natural gas and pipeline, telecommunications and fiber optic licensing industries, and no impairment was indicated. The 15-year discounted cash
flow model used for fiber optic licensing is based on the long-term nature of the underlying fiber optic network licensing agreements. Quanta assigned a higher weighting to the discounted cash flow approach in all periods to reflect increased expectations of market value being determined from a held and used model. Discount
rates for the 2011 analysis were decreased for the reporting units providing predominately electric power, natural gas and pipeline and telecommunications infrastructure services due to generally more favorable market conditions for these reporting
units in 2011 as compared to 2010. At December31, 2010, certain EBITDA multiples were increased slightly from 2009 multiples to reflect more favorable market conditions as the effects of the economic recession had lessened. 
Quantas intangible assets include customer relationships, backlog, trade names, non-compete agreements, patented
rights and developed technology and software, all subject to amortization, along with other intangible assets not subject to amortization. The value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired using the value-in-use
concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the excess earnings method. The excess earnings analysis consists of discounting to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to
customer contract renewals, the importance or lack thereof of existing customer relationships to Quantas business plan, income taxes and required rates of return. Quanta values backlog for acquired businesses as of the acquisition date based
upon the contractual nature of the backlog within each service line, using the income approach to discount back to present value the cash flows attributable to the backlog. The value of trade names is estimated using the relief-from-royalty method
of the income approach. This approach is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of this intangible asset. 
Quanta amortizes intangible assets based upon the estimated consumption of the economic benefits of each intangible
asset, or on a straight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefits consumption cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment and are tested for recoverability whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For instance, a significant change in business climate or a loss of a significant customer, among other things, may trigger the need for interim impairment testing of
intangible assets. An impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
In the normal course of business, Quanta enters
into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or
other forms of equity participation. These investments may also include Quantas participation in different finance structures such as the extension of loans to project specific entities, the acquisition of convertible notes issued by project
specific entities, or other strategic financing arrangements. Quanta determines whether such investments involve a variable interest entity VIE based on the characteristics of the subject entity. If the entity is determined to be a VIE, then
management determines if Quanta is the primary beneficiary of the entity and whether or not consolidation of the VIE is required. The primary beneficiary consolidating the VIE must normally meet both of the following characteristics: ithe
power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly affect the VIEs economic performance and iithe obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE, in either case that could potentially
be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and the other partys equity interest in the VIE is accounted for as a noncontrolling interest. In cases where Quanta determines that it has
an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated VIE e.g., a general partnership interest, such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quantas ownership interest in the unincorporated
entity. Investments in minority interests in entities of which Quanta is not the primary beneficiary, but
over which Quanta has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Quantas share of net income or losses from unconsolidated equity investments is included in other income expense in
the consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment by assessing whether any decline in the fair value of the investment below the carrying value is other than temporary. In making this determination, factors
such as the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment and the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity are evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized. Any impairment losses would be
recognized in other expense. Equity method investments are carried at original cost and are included in other assets, net in the consolidated balance sheet and are adjusted for Quantas proportionate share of the investees income, losses
and distributions. In 2011, Quanta acquired an equity ownership interest of approximately 39% in Howard
Midstream Energy Partners, LLC HEP for an initial capital contribution of $350 million. HEP is engaged in the business of owning, operating and constructing midstream plant and pipeline assets in the natural gas and oil industry. HEP commenced
operations in June 2011 with the acquisitions of Texas Pipeline LLC, a pipeline operator in the Eagle Ford shale region of South Texas, and Bottom Line Services, LLC, a construction services company. Quanta accounts for this investment using the
equity method of accounting. During the third quarter of 2011, Quanta loaned $40 million to the indirect
parent of NJ Oak Solar, LLC NJ Oak Solar. The loan proceeds, together with NJ Oak Solars other financing and equity funds, were used for their construction of a 10 MW solar power generation facility in New Jersey. The construction of the
facility, which began in the second quarter of 2011, is being performed by Quanta and was substantially complete at the end of 2011.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
price and non-fixed price installation contracts. Pricing under these contracts may be competitive unit price, cost-plus/hourly or time and materials basis or fixed price or lump sum basis,
and the final terms and prices of these contracts are frequently negotiated with the customer. Under unit-based contracts, the utilization of an output-based measurement is appropriate for revenue recognition. Under these contracts, Quanta
recognizes revenue as units are completed based on pricing established between Quanta and the customer for each unit of delivery, which best reflects the pattern in which the obligation to the customer is fulfilled. Under cost-plus/hourly and time
and materials type contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred and services are performed. Revenues from fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs for each contract. These
contracts provide for a fixed amount of revenues for the entire project. Such contracts provide that the customer accept completion of progress to date and compensate Quanta for services rendered, which may be measured in terms of units installed,
hours expended or some other measure of progress. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation
costs. Much of the materials associated with Quantas work are owner-furnished and are therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of Quantas
engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Changes in job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence managements assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to
complete those contracts and therefore Quantas profit recognition. Changes in these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined. Provisions for
losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Quanta may incur costs subject to change orders, whether approved or unapproved by the customer, and/or claims related to certain contracts. Quanta determines the probability that such costs will be
recovered based upon evidence such as past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer or verbal approvals. Quanta treats items as a cost of contract performance in the period incurred if it is not
probable that the costs will be recovered or will recognize revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and can be reliably estimated. As of December31,2011 and 2010, Quanta had approximately $773 million and
$831 million of change orders and/or claims that had been included as contract price adjustments on certain contracts which were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. 
The current asset Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed price contracts. The current liability Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized for fixed
price contracts.

Fiber Optic Licensing The Fiber Optic Licensing segment
constructs and licenses the right to use fiber optic telecommunications facilities to its customers pursuant to licensing agreements, typically with terms of five to twenty-five years, inclusive of certain renewal options. Under those agreements,
customers are provided the right to use a portion of the capacity of a fiber optic facility, with the facility owned and maintained by Quanta. Revenues, including any initial fees or advance billings, are recognized ratably over the expected length
of the agreements, including probable renewal periods. As of December31,2011 and 2010, initial fees and advance billings on these licensing agreements not yet recorded in revenue were $474 million and $444 million and are recognized as
deferred revenue, with $383 million and $347 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Minimum future licensing revenues expected to be recognized by Quanta pursuant to these agreements at
December31,2011 are as follows in thousands: 
Year Ending December 31  2012 83,937 2013 65,832 2014 47,889 2015 27,394 2016 19,368 Thereafter 118,158 
Fixed non-cancelable minimum licensing revenues 362,578 
Income Taxes 
Quanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are
expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. Quanta regularly
evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of deferred tax
assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If
actual future taxable income differs from these estimates, Quanta may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent estimated. Quanta records reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions in those instances where Quanta considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected
on income tax returns filed. When recording reserves for expected tax consequences of uncertain positions, Quanta assumes that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to
additional tax obligations and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have
been accrued and are classified in the provision for income taxes. The income tax laws and regulations are
voluminous and often ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in its future consolidated balance sheets and statements of
operations. 
89 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Collective Bargaining Agreements 
Certain of Quantas subsidiaries are parties to various
collective bargaining agreements with certain of their employees. The agreements require such subsidiaries to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and
employee benefit trusts. Quantas multi-employer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union
employee payrolls. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
Quanta recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based
compensation based on the fair value of the awards granted, net of estimated forfeitures, at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of Quantas
common stock on the date of grant. An estimate of future forfeitures is required in determining the period expense. Quanta uses historical data to estimate the forfeiture rate; however, these estimates are subject to change and may impact the value
that will ultimately be realized as compensation expense. The resulting compensation expense from discretionary awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, while
compensation expense from performance based awards is recognized using the graded vesting method over the requisite service period. The cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the compensation expense recognized for restricted
stock and stock options excess tax benefit are classified as financing cash flows. 
Functional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements 
The U.S.dollar is the functional currency
for the majority of Quantas operations, which are primarily located within the United States. The functional currency for Quantas foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada, is typically the currency of the country in
which the foreign operating unit is located. Generally, the currency in which the operating unit transacts the majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures, would be considered the functional currency.
Under the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of foreign currency translation gains or losses is dependent upon managements determination of the functional currency of each operating unit, which involves consideration of all relevant
economic facts and circumstances affecting the operating unit. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the financial statements of its foreign operating units from their functional currency into U.S.dollars.
Statements of operations and cash flows are translated at average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at the month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance sheets at the month-end exchange rates results in translation gains
or losses. If transactions are denominated in the operating units functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of equity under the caption Accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
If transactions are not denominated in the operating units functional currency, the translation gains and losses are included within the statement of operations. 
Derivatives 
From time to time, Quanta enters into forward currency contracts that qualify as
derivatives in order to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions. Quanta does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative
purposes; however, for accounting purposes, certain transactions may not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting. For a hedge to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, a hedge must be documented at the
90 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
inception of the contract, with the objective and strategy stated, along with an explicit description of the methodology used to assess hedge effectiveness. The dates or periods for the
expected forecasted events and the nature of the exposure involved including quantitative measures of the size of the exposure must also be documented. At the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge must be deemed to be
highly effective at minimizing the risk of the identified exposure. Effectiveness measures relate the gains or losses of the derivative to changes in the cash flows associated with the hedged item, and the forecasted transaction must be
probable of occurring. For forward contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges, Quanta accounts for the change
in fair value of the forward contracts directly in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Any ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period in which ineffectiveness occurs. For instance, if
a forward contract is discontinued as a cash flow hedge because it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period, the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss would be reclassified to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period such determination is made. When a forecasted transaction occurs, the portion of the accumulated gain or loss applicable to the
forecasted transaction is reclassified from equity to earnings. Changes in fair value related to transactions that do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are recorded in the consolidated results of operations and are included in
other income expense. 
Comprehensive Income 
Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period except
those resulting from investments by and distributions to stockholders. Quanta records other comprehensive income loss, net of tax, for foreign currency translation adjustments related to its foreign operations and changes in fair value of
Quantas derivative contracts that were classified as cash flow hedges, as applicable. 
Litigation Costs and Reserves 
Quanta records reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as incurred. Further details are presented in Note14. 
Fair Value Measurements 
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of those instruments. For disclosure purposes, qualifying assets and liabilities are categorized into three broad levels based on the priority of
the inputs used to determine their fair values. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level1and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs Level3. All of Quantas cash equivalents are categorized as Level1 assets at December31,2011 and 2010, as all values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that Quanta has
the ability to access. In connection with Quantas acquisitions, identifiable intangible assets acquired
include goodwill, backlog, customer relationships, trade names, covenants not to compete and software. Quanta utilizes the fair value premise as the primary basis for its valuation procedures, which is a market-based approach to determining the
price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Quanta periodically engages the services of an independent valuation firm when a new business is acquired to assist
management with this valuation process, which includes assistance with the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the development of market-based valuation assumptions. Based on 
91 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
these considerations, management utilizes various valuation methods, including an income approach, a market approach and a cost approach, to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired
based on the appropriateness of each method in relation to the type of asset being valued. The assumptions used in these valuation methods are analyzed and compared, where possible, to available market data, such as industry-based weighted average
costs of capital and discount rates, trade name royalty rates, public company valuation multiples and recent market acquisition multiples. The level of inputs used for these fair value measurements is the lowest level Level3. Quanta believes
that these valuation methods appropriately represent the methods that would be used by other market participants in determining fair value. Quanta uses fair value measurements on a routine basis in its assessment of assets classified as goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets held and used. In accordance with its annual
impairment test during the quarter ended December31,2011, the carrying amounts of such assets, including goodwill, were compared to their fair values. The inputs used for fair value measurements for goodwill, other intangible assets and
long-lived assets held and used are the lowest level Level3inputs for which Quanta uses the assistance of third party specialists to develop valuation assumptions. 
Quanta also uses fair value measurements in connection with the valuation of its investments in private company equity
interests and financing instruments. These valuations require significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such assets. Typically, the initial costs of these
investments are considered to represent fair market value, as such amounts are negotiated between willing market participants. On a quarterly basis, Quanta performs an evaluation of its investments to determine if an other-than-temporary decline in
the value of each investment has occurred andwhether the recorded amount of each investment will be realizable. If an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an investment occurs, a fair value analysis would be performed to determine the
degree to which the investment was impaired and a corresponding charge to earnings would be recorded during the period. These types of fair market value assessments are similar to other fair value measures used by Quanta, which include the use of
significant judgment and available relevant market data. Such market data may include observations of the valuation of comparable companies, risk adjusted discount rates and an evaluation of the expected performance of the underlying portfolio
asset, including historical and projected levels of profitability or cash flows. In addition, a variety of additional factors will be reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, contemporaneous financing and sales transactions with third
parties, changes in market outlook and the third-party financing environment.

in a Multiemployer PlanASU2011-09. This guidance requires employers to make various disclosures for each individually significant multiemployer plan that provides pension benefits to its employees. Generally, an employer must
disclose the employers contributions to the plan during the period and provide a description of the nature and effect of any significant changes that affect comparability of total employer contributions from period to period. Additionally, the
employer is required to provide a description of the nature of the plan benefits, a qualitative description of the extent to which the employer could be responsible for the obligations of the plan and other quantitative information, to the extent
available, as of the most recent date available, to help users understand the financial information for each significant plan. An employer should also provide disclosures for total contributions made to all plans that are not individually
significant and total contributions made to all plans. If certain quantitative information cannot be obtained without undue cost and

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
effort, that quantitative information may be omitted, although the employer should describe what information has been omitted and why. The required disclosures must be provided retrospectively
for all prior periods presented. The adoption of ASU2011-09did not have a material impact on Quantas consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows but did impact the disclosures in the notes to its
consolidated financial statements. See Note12 for the disclosures related to Quantas participation in multi-employer plans. In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements
in U.S.GAAP and IFRSs ASU2011-04,which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2011. This guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value
measurements. Additional disclosure requirements in the update include: 1for Level3 fair value measurements, quantitative information about unobservable inputs used, a description of the valuation processes used by the entity, and a
qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs; 2for an entitys use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the assets highest and best use, the reason for the
difference; 3for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required, the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined; and 4the disclosure of all
transfers between Level1 and Level2 of the fair value hierarchy. Quanta adoptedASU2011-04on January1, 2012. Quanta does not anticipate that ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements but will consider whether any additional disclosures are necessary. In June 2011, the FASB issued
ASU2011-05,Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05,which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2011. Accordingly, Quanta adopted
ASU2011-05on January1, 2012. This guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. This guidance is intended to increase the
prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring that such amounts be presented either in a single continuous statement of income and comprehensive income or separately in consecutive statements of income and
comprehensive income. The adoption of ASU2011-05is not expected to have a material impact on Quantas disclosures.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
In September 2011, the FASB issued
ASU2011-08,Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for Impairment the revised standard ASU 2011-08,which is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2011. This guidance gives entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step goodwill impairment test. If an entity believes that, as a
result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. An entity can choose
to perform the qualitative assessment on none, some or all of its reporting units. An entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test, and then resume
performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. ASU2011-08also includes new qualitative indicators that replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required to be performed.
The adoption of ASU2011-08is not expected to have a material impact on Quantas financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

been included in Quantas consolidated results of operations since October1, 2009. Also in 2009,
Quanta completed three other acquisitions of specialty contractors with operations in the electric power, natural gas and pipeline and telecommunications industries for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $360 million, consisting of a
total of approximately $253 million in cash and approximately 05million shares of Quanta common stock valued in the aggregate at approximately $107 million as of the dates of acquisition. These acquisitions enhance Quantas electric
power, natural gas and pipeline and telecommunications capabilities throughout various regions of the United States and Western Canada. The following table summarizes the aggregate consideration paid for the 2011 and 2010 acquisitions and presents the allocation of these amounts to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based
on their estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. This allocation requires the significant use of estimates and is based on information that was available to management at the time these consolidated financial statements were

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount
of the fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 2011 and 2010 acquisitions strategically expand Quantas Canadian service offering, add an Australian service offering and enhance its domestic electric power
infrastructure service offerings, which Quanta believes contributes to the recognition of the goodwill. In connection with the 2011 acquisitions, goodwill of $349 million was recorded for reporting units included within Quantas electric power
division and $89 million was recorded for the reporting unit included within Quantas natural gas and pipeline division at December31, 2011. In connection with the 2010 acquisition, goodwill of $1094 million was recorded and included
within Quantas electric power division at December31, 2010. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes other than $131 million recorded in 2011.

PER SHARE INFORMATION: 
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases
where the effect of the common stock equivalent would be antidilutive.
The amounts used to compute the basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are illustrated below in thousands: 
Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 NET INCOME Net income attributable to common stock 132,515 153,176 162,162 
Net income attributable to common stock for diluted earnings per share 132,515 153,176 162,162

Weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share 213,168 211,796 201,311 
For the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, a nominal number of stock options were
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of the stock options were greater than the average market price of Quantas common stock. The 39million exchangeable shares of a Canadian subsidiary
of Quanta that were issued pursuant to the acquisition of Valard on October25,2010, which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis with shares of Quanta common stock, are included in weighted average shares outstanding for basic and
diluted earnings per share for the full year of 2011 and are weighted for the portion of 2010 they were outstanding. Shares of Quanta common stock placed in escrow related to a previous acquisition are included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, and are weighted based on the portion of the year they were held in escrow. These shares were released from escrow on April4, 2011. For the years ended December31,
2010 and 2009, the effect of assuming conversion of Quantas 375% convertible subordinated notes due 2026 375% Notes would have been antidilutive and therefore the shares issuable upon conversion were excluded from the calculation of
diluted earnings per share. The 375% Notes were not outstanding after May1, 2010 and therefore had no impact on diluted shares during the year ended December31, 2011.

Credit Facility Quanta has a credit agreement with various lenders that provides for a $7000 million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on August2, 2016. The entire amount of the facility is
available for the issuance of letters of credit, and up to $250 million of the facility is available for swing line loans. Up to $1000 million of the facility is available for revolving loans and letters of credit in certain alternative currencies
in addition to the U.S. dollar. Borrowings under the credit agreement are to be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. Quanta entered into the credit agreement on
August2, 2011, which amended and restated its prior credit agreement. As of December31, 2011,
Quanta had approximately $1914 million of letters of credit issued under the credit facility and no outstanding revolving loans. The remaining $5086 million was available for revolving loans or issuing new letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under
the credit agreement in U.S. dollars bear interest, at Quantas option, at a rate equal to either athe Eurocurrency Rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 125% to 250%, as determined based on Quantas Consolidated
Leverage Ratio as described below, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost as defined in the credit agreement required to compensate lenders for the cost of compliance with certain European regulatory requirements, or bthe Base Rate as
described below plus 025% to 150%, as determined based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Amounts borrowed under the credit agreement in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Eurocurrency Rate plus
125% to 250%, as determined based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio, plus, if applicable, any Mandatory Cost. Standby letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of 125% to 250%, based on
Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio, and Performance Letters of Credit as defined in the credit agreement issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of 075% to
150%, based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Quanta is also

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
subject to a commitment fee of 020% to 045%, based on Quantas Consolidated Leverage Ratio, on any unused availability under the credit agreement. The Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the
ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement. For purposes of calculating both the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and the maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio discussed below, total
funded debt and total senior debt are reduced by all cash and Cash Equivalents as defined in the credit agreement held by Quanta in excess of $250 million. The Base Rate equals the highest of ithe Federal Funds Rate as defined in the
credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1%, iiBank of Americas prime rate and iiithe Eurocurrency Rate plus 100%. Subject to certain exceptions, the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of Quanta and its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries, and by a pledge of all of the capital stock of
Quantas wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of the direct foreign subsidiaries of Quanta or its wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries. Quantas wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries also guarantee the repayment of all amounts
due under the credit agreement. Subject to certain conditions, at any time Quanta maintains a corporate credit rating that is BBB- stable or higher by Standard Poors Rating Services and a corporate family rating that is Baa3
stable or higher by Moodys Investors Services, all collateral will be automatically released from these liens. The credit agreement contains certain covenants, including a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in each case as specified in the credit agreement. The credit
agreement also contains a maximum senior debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio, as specified in the credit agreement, that will be in effect at any time that the collateral securing the credit agreement has been and remains released. The credit
agreement limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, capital expenditures, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on assets. The credit agreement also includes
limits on the payment of dividends and stock repurchase programs in any fiscal year except those payments or other distributions payable solely in capital stock. As of December31, 2011, Quanta was in compliance with all of the covenants in the
credit agreement. The credit agreement provides for customary events of default and includes cross-default
provisions with Quantas underwriting, continuing indemnity and security agreement with its sureties and all of Quantas other debt instruments exceeding $300 million in borrowings or availability. If an event of default as defined in
the credit agreement occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, amounts outstanding under the credit agreement may be accelerated and may become or be declared immediately due and
payable. Prior to August2, 2011, Quanta had a credit agreement that provided for a $4750 million
senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on September19, 2012. Subject to the conditions specified in the prior credit agreement, borrowings under the prior credit facility were to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and
other general corporate purposes. The entire unused portion of the prior credit facility was available for the issuance of letters of credit. Amounts borrowed under the prior credit facility bore interest, at Quantas option, at a rate equal to either athe Eurodollar Rate as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 0875% to
175%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the prior credit agreement, or bthe base rate as described below plus 000% to 075%, as determined by the ratio of Quantas
total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility were subject to a letter of credit fee of 0875% to 175%, based on the ratio of Quantas total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA. Quanta was
also subject to a commitment fee of 015% to 035%, based on the ratio of its total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA, on any unused availability under the prior credit facility. The base rate equaled the higher of ithe Federal Funds Rate
as defined in the prior credit agreement plus 1/2 of 1% or iithe banks prime rate.

375%Convertible Subordinated Notes 
As of December31, 2011 and 2010, none of Quantas 375% Notes were outstanding. The 375% Notes were originally
issued in April 2006 in an aggregate principal amount of $1438 million and required semi-annual interest payments on April30 and October30 until maturity. On May14, 2010, Quanta redeemed all of the $1438 million aggregate
principal amount outstanding of the 375% Notes at a redemption price of 101607% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The redemption resulted in a payment of the
aggregate redemption price of $1461 million and the recognition of a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $71 million. Included in the loss on early extinguishment of debt was a non-cash loss of $35 million related to the
difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the 375% Notes, calculated as of the date of redemption, the payment of $23 million representing the 1607% redemption premium above par value and a non-cash loss of $13
million from the write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 375% Notes.  9.

The valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets at
December31,2011, 2010, and 2009 was $88 million, $114 million, and $86 million, respectively. These valuation allowances relate to state net operating loss carryforwards, a deferred tax asset for goodwill and foreign tax credit
carryforwards. The net change in the total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December31,2011, 2010, and 2009 was a decrease of $26 million, an increase of $28 million and a decrease of $06 million, respectively. The
valuation allowance was established primarily as a result of uncertainty in Quantas outlook as to future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its
deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowances. 
At December31,2011, Quanta had state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the
tax effect of which is approximately $156 million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2012, $03 million; 2013, $04 million; 2014, $08 million; 2015, $03 million; 2016, $03 million and $135 million thereafter. A valuation allowance of
$64 million has been recorded against certain state net operating loss carryforwards. 
Through December31,2011, Quanta has not provided U.S.income
taxes on unremitted foreign earnings because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.It is not practicable to determine the amount of any additional U.S.tax liability that may result if Quanta decides to
no longer indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings outside the U.S.

For the year ended December31, 2011, the $86 million reduction is
primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the 2007 tax year and the $49 million reduction primarily relates to settlement with tax authorities regarding a foreign tax credit position taken in a
pre-acquisition tax return of an acquired business. For the year ended December31,2010, the $103 million reduction is primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the 2006 tax year. For the
year ended December31,2009, the $250 million reduction is primarily due to the expiration of certain federal and state statutes of limitations for the 2005 tax year.

Quanta recognized $07 million of interest expense and $22 million and $36 million of interest income in the provision for income taxes for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
Quanta is subject to income tax in the United States, multiple state jurisdictions and a few foreign jurisdictions.
Quanta remains open to examination by the IRS for tax years 2008 through 2011 as these statutes of limitations have not yet expired. Quanta does not consider any state in which it does business to be a major tax jurisdiction. 
10.EQUITY: 
Exchangeable Shares and Series F Preferred Stock 
In connection with acquisition of Valard as discussed in Note 4, certain former owners of Valard received exchangeable
shares of a Canadian subsidiary of Quanta which may be exchanged at the option of the holder for Quanta common stock on a one-for-one basis. The holders of exchangeable shares can make an exchange only once in any calendar quarter and must exchange
a minimum of either 50,000 shares or, if less, the total number of remaining exchangeable shares registered in the name of the holder making the request. Quanta also issued one share of Quanta SeriesF preferred stock to a voting trust on
behalf of the holders of the exchangeable shares. The SeriesF preferred stock provides the holders of the exchangeable shares voting rights in Quanta common stock equivalent to the number of exchangeable shares outstanding at any time. The
combination of the exchangeable shares and the share of SeriesF preferred stock gives the holders of the exchangeable shares rights equivalent to Quanta common stockholders with respect to dividends, voting and other economic rights.

Limited Vote Common Stock 
Effective May19, 2011, each outstanding share of Quantas Limited Vote Common Stock was reclassified and
converted into 105 shares of Quanta common stock, as set forth in a Certificate of Amendment to Restated Certificate of Incorporation approved by the stockholders of Quanta and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on
May19, 2011. At December31, 2011 and 2010, there were 0 and 432,485 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock outstanding. The Certificate of Amendment also eliminated entirely the class of Limited Vote Common Stock. The shares of Limited Vote
Common Stock had rights similar to shares of common stock, except with respect to voting. Holders of Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to vote as a separate class to elect one director and did not vote in the election of other directors.
Holders of Limited Vote Common Stock were entitled to one-tenth of one vote for each share held on all other matters submitted for stockholder action. Shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were convertible into Quanta common stock upon disposition by
the holder of such shares in accordance with the transfer restrictions applicable to such shares. During the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, noshares of Limited Vote Common Stock were converted to common stock upon
transfer. In 2011, 432,485 shares of Limited Vote Common Stock were reclassified and converted into 454,107 shares of Quanta common stock pursuant to the Certificate of Amendment approved by the stockholders. In 2010, Quanta issued an aggregate
241,300shares of its common stock in exchange for an aggregate 229,808shares of Limited Vote Common Stock through voluntary exchanges initiated by individual stockholders. 
Treasury Stock 
During the second quarter of 2011,
Quantas board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing Quanta to purchase, from time to time, up to $1500 million of its outstanding common stock. These repurchases could be made in open market transactions, in privately
negotiated transactions, including block purchases, or otherwise, at managements discretion based on market and business conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors. This program does not obligate Quanta to acquire any specific
amount of common stock and will continue until it is completed or otherwise modified or terminated by Quantas board of directors at any time in its sole discretion and without notice. The stock repurchase program is funded with cash on hand.
From the time the stock repurchase program was initiated through December31, 2011, Quanta repurchased 81million shares of its common stock under this program at an aggregate cost of $1495 million. These shares and the related cost to
acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock. Under Delaware corporate law, treasury stock is not entitled to vote or be counted for quorum purposes. 
Under the stock incentive plans described in Note11, employees may elect to satisfy their tax
withholding obligations upon vesting of restricted stock by having Quanta make such tax payments and withhold a number of vested shares having a value on the date of vesting equal to their tax withholding obligation. As a result of such employee
elections, Quanta withheld 299,804shares of Quanta common stock in 2011 with a total market value of $66 million, 243,821shares of Quanta common stock in 2010 with a total market value of $46 million and 210,469shares of Quanta
common stock in 2009 with a total market value of $36 million, in each case for settlement of employee tax liabilities. These shares and the related cost to acquire them were accounted for as an adjustment to the balance of treasury stock.
Noncontrolling Interest 
Quanta holds investments in several joint ventures that provide infrastructure services under specific customer contracts.
Each joint venture is owned equally by its members. Quanta has determined that certain of these joint ventures are variable interest entities, with Quanta providing the majority of the infrastructure services to the joint venture, which management
believes most significantly influences the economic performance of the 
107 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
joint venture. Management has concluded that Quanta is the primary beneficiary of each of these joint ventures and has accounted for each on a consolidated basis. The other parties equity
interests in these joint ventures have been accounted for as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements. Income attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a reduction of reported net income
attributable to common stock in the amount of $119 million, $24 million and $14 million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Equity in the consolidated assets and liabilities of these joint ventures that is
attributable to the other joint venture members has been accounted for as a component of noncontrolling interests within total equity in the accompanying balance sheets. 
The carrying value of the investments held by Quanta in all of its variable interest entities was approximately $73
million and $14 million at December31, 2011 and 2010. The carrying value of investments held by the noncontrolling interests in these variable interest entities at December31, 2011 and 2010 was $73 million and $14 million. During the
years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, distributions to noncontrolling interests were $60 million and $24 million. See Note 14 for further disclosures related to Quantas joint venture arrangements. 
Comprehensive Income Quantas foreign operations are translated into U.S.dollars, and a translation adjustment is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax, as a result. Additionally, unrealized gains and
losses on certain hedging activities are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. The following table presents the components of comprehensive income for the periods presented in thousands: 
Year Ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Net income 144,416 155,557 163,535 Foreign currency translation adjustment, net of tax 12,235 10,210 6,868 Other 1,177 Change in unrealized gain loss on foreign currency cash flow hedges, net of tax 410 410

Comprehensive income attributable to common stock 119,103 163,796 168,620 
In the third quarter of 2009, one of Quantas Canadian operating units entered into three forward
contracts with settlement dates in 2009 and 2010, to reduce foreign currency risk associated with anticipated customer sales that were denominated in South African rand. This same operating unit also entered into three additional forward contracts
with the same settlement dates to reduce the foreign currency exposure associated with a series of forecasted intercompany payments denominated in U.S.dollars to be made over a twelve-month period. These contracts were accounted for as cash
flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the forward contracts were recorded in other comprehensive income prior to their settlement and were reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the hedged transactions occurred.
The South African rand to Canadian dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately
$110 million $CAD at origination, and the Canadian dollar to U.S.Dollar forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $95 million U.S. at origination. During the year ended December31, 2010, net losses of $04
million were recorded in income in connection with the settled contracts. There were no forward contracts outstanding at December31,2011 or December31, 2010, and as a result, there

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
is no balance related to the forward contracts in other comprehensive income. During the year ended December31, 2009, losses of $08 million were recorded in income in connection with the
settled contracts, and at December31, 2009, there was a loss of $04 million in other comprehensive income related to the forward contracts. Effectiveness testing related to these cash flow hedges was performed at the end of each quarter while they were outstanding. Any ineffective portion of these contracts was reclassified into earnings if
the derivatives were no longer deemed to be cash flow hedges. For the years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, a nominal portion of the forward contracts were considered ineffective. 
11.EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION: 
Stock Incentive Plans 
On May19, 2011, Quantas stockholders approved the Quanta Services, Inc. 2011 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan
the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan provides for the award of non-qualified stock options, incentive qualified stock options ISOs, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units RSUs, stock bonus awards, performance
compensation awards including cash bonus awards or any combination of the foregoing. The purpose of the 2011 Plan is to provide participants with additional performance incentives by increasing their proprietary interest in Quanta. Employees,
directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta or its affiliates are eligible to participate in the 2011 Plan, as are prospective employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors of Quanta who have agreed to serve Quanta in those
capacities. An aggregate of 11,750,000 shares of Quanta common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2011 Plan. Additionally, pursuant to the Quanta Services, Inc. 2007 Stock Incentive Plan the 2007 Plan, which was adopted on May24, 2007, Quanta may award restricted common stock, incentive stock options and
non-qualified stock options to eligible employees, directors, and certain consultants and advisors. An aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Quanta also has a Restricted Stock
Unit Plan the RSU Plan, pursuant to which RSUs may be awarded to certain employees and consultants of Quantas Canadian operations. Equity awards also remain outstanding under a prior plan adopted by Quanta, as well as under plans assumed by Quanta in connection with its acquisition of InfraSource Services, Inc. in 2007. While no
further awards may be made under these plans, the awards outstanding under the plans continue to be governed by their terms. These plans, together with the 2011 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the RSU Plan, are referred to as the Plans. 
The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Quanta. The Compensation Committee
has, subject to applicable regulation and the terms of the Plans, the authority to grant awards under the Plans, to construe and interpret the Plans and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plans. The Board also delegated to the Equity Grant Committee, a committee of the Board consisting of one or more directors, the authority to grant limited awards to eligible persons who are not executive officers or
non-employee directors. Stock Options 
Awards in the form of stock options are exercisable during the
period specified in each stock option agreement and generally become exercisable in installments pursuant to a vesting schedule designated by the Compensation Committee or, if applicable, the Equity Grant Committee. No option will remain exercisable
later than 10 years after the date of award or five years in the case of ISOs awarded to employees owning more than 10% of Quantas voting capital stock. The exercise price for ISOs awarded under the 2011 and 2007 Plans may be no less than
the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of award or 110% in the case of 
109 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
ISOs awarded to employees owning more than 10% of Quantas voting capital stock. Upon the exercise of stock options, Quanta has historically issued shares of common stock rather than
treasury shares or shares purchased on the open market, although the plan permits any of the three. Quanta did not grant any awards of stock options under any of the Plans during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 or 2009. 
Restricted Stock 
Awards in the form of restricted stock are subject to forfeiture
and other restrictions until they vest. Restricted shares of Quantas common stock have been issued under the Plans at the fair market value of the common stock as of the date of issuance. The shares of restricted common stock issued are
subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting, which generally occurs over three years in equal annual installments. During the restriction period, holders are entitled to vote and receive dividends on
such shares. The grant date fair value for awards of restricted stock is based on the market value of Quanta common stock on the date of grant. During the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, Quanta granted 11million, 12million and 11million shares of restricted stock under the Plans with a weighted average
grant date fair value price of $2140, $1920 and $2210, respectively. During the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, 10million, 08million and 06million shares vested, respectively, with an approximate fair
value at the time of vesting of $215 million, $147 million and $131 million, respectively. 
A summary of the restricted stock activity for the year ended December31,2011 is as
follows shares in thousands:  Shares WeightedAverageGrantDateFair ValuePer share Unvested at January 1, 2011 2,070 2068 Granted 1,124 2140 Vested 963 2132 Forfeited 94 2069 
Unvested at December 31, 2011 2,137 2077 
As of December31,2011, there was approximately $222 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock granted to both employees and non-employees. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 162 years. 
Restricted Stock Units 
RSUs granted by Quanta under the Plans are intended to provide
plan participants with cash performance incentives that are substantially equivalent to the risks and rewards of equity ownership in Quanta by providing the participants with rights to receive a cash bonus that is determined by reference to
Quantas common stock price. The number of RSUs awarded to grantees is determined based on the dollar amount of the grant and the closing price on the date of grant of a share of Quanta common stock. The RSUs vest over a designated period,
typically three years, and are subject to forfeiture under certain conditions, primarily termination of service. Upon vesting of RSUs, the holders receive a cash bonus equal to the number of RSUs vested multiplied by Quantas common stock price
on the vesting date. In the future, Quanta may also issue RSUs, that upon vesting, provide for the issuance of Quanta common stock. 
110 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Compensation expense related to RSUs was $13 million and $05 million
for the years ended December31,2011 and 2010. Such expense is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. As the RSUs are settled only in cash, they are not included in the calculation of earnings per share, and the
estimated earned value of the RSUs is classified as a liability. Quanta paid $10 million and $03 million to settle liabilities related to RSUs in 2011 and 2010. Liabilities recorded under the RSUs were $13 million and $02 million at
December31,2011 and 2010.

12.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS: 
Unions Multi-Employer Pension Plans 
Quanta contributes to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining
agreements with various unions that represent certain of Quantas employees. Quantas contribution rates to the multi-employer pension plans generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and
contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multi-employer defined benefit pension
plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities contingent upon an employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the
employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $326 million related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta
subsidiaries from the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan Central States Plan following an amendment to the applicable collective bargaining agreement which eliminated their obligations to contribute to the Central States
Plan. See further information regarding these subsidiaries withdrawal from the Central States Plan in Note 14Collective Bargaining Agreements. 
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 the PPA also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to
plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on a multitude of factors including, for example, the plans
111 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status
through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta
contributes are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such
amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans, and the amount of that future work and the number of affected employees that may be needed cannot reasonably be
estimated. The following table contains a summary of plan information relating to Quantas participation
in multi-employer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status under the PPA of the plans and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution
surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status available in 2011 and 2010 relates to the plans fiscal year-end in 2010 and 2009. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2011. The PPA zone status is based on information that
Quanta received from the respective plans as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website and is certified by the plans actuary. Although a multitude of factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone
status, plans in the red zone generally are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are
classified as critical status, yellow zone plans are classified as endangered status and green zone plans are classified as neither endangered nor critical status. The Subject to Financial
Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan FIP or a rehabilitation plan RP is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quantas
collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject. Changes in annual contribution levels to these plans will vary because the number of union employees, the duration of their employment and the plans in which they participate will vary
from period to period based on the number and location of projects that Quanta has ongoing at any given time and the need for union resources in connection with those projects. Although Price Gregory was acquired on October 1, 2009, all of its
related contributions to defined benefit multi-employer pension plans for the year ended December 31, 2009 have been included in the table below. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans and in the aggregate for
all other plans.

Quanta 401k Plan 
Quanta has a 401k plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective
bargaining agreement may make contributions through a payroll deduction. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of 100% of each employees contribution up to 3% of that employees salary and 50% of each employees contribution
between 3% and 6% of such employees salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to non-union defined contribution plans by Quanta were approximately $109 million, $102 million and $100 million for the years ended
December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 
13.RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS: 
Certain of Quantas operating units have entered into related party lease arrangements for
operational facilities, typically with prior owners of certain acquired businesses. These lease agreements generally have terms of up to five years. Related party lease expense for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009 was
approximately $50 million, $32 million and $54 million, respectively. 
14.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
Investments in Affiliates and Other Entities 
As described in Note10, Quanta holds investments in certain joint ventures with third parties for the purpose of
providing infrastructure services under certain customer contracts. Losses incurred by these joint ventures are shared equally by the joint venture members. However, each member of the joint venture is jointly and severally liable for all of the
obligations of the joint venture under the contract with the customer and therefore can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. In circumstances where Quantas participation in a joint ventures qualifies as a general
partnership, the joint venture partners are jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture, including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead
to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these joint and several liabilities. In
the joint venture arrangements entered into by Quanta, each joint venturer indemnifies the other party for any liabilities incurred in excess of the liabilities such other party is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement. It
is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if the other joint venturer failed or refused to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would
lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would not be indemnified.

Leases 
Quanta leases certain land, buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements, including related party leases
as discussed in Note13. The terms of these agreements vary from lease to lease, including some with renewal options and escalation clauses. The following schedule shows the future minimum lease payments under these leases as of
December31,2011 in thousands:  OperatingLeases Year Ending December 31 2012 43,922 2013 28,924 2014 18,608 2015 12,901 2016 8,969 Thereafter 18,783 
Total minimum lease payments 132,107 
Rent expense related to operating leases was approximately $1188 million, $1094 million and $1122
million for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Quanta has guaranteed
the residual value on certain of its equipment operating leases. Quanta has agreed to pay any difference between this residual value and the fair market value of the underlying asset at the date of termination of the leases. At
December31,2011, the maximum guaranteed residual value was approximately $1260 million. Quanta believes that no significant payments will be made as a result of the difference between the fair market value of the leased equipment and
the guaranteed residual value. However, there can be no assurance that significant payments will not be required in the future. 
Committed Capital Expenditures Quanta has committed capital for the expansion of its fiber optic network, although Quanta typically does not commit capital to new network expansions until it has a committed licensing arrangement in
place with at least one customer. The amounts of committed capital expenditures are estimates of costs required to build the networks under contract. The actual capital expenditures related to building the networks could vary materially from these
estimates. As of December31,2011, Quanta estimates these committed capital expenditures to be approximately $141 million for the year ended December31, 2012. 
Litigation and Claims Quanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for
alleged personal injury, breach of contract and/or property damages, employment-related damages, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings,
Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible.
Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings, separately or in the aggregate, are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In all instances,
management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the

nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success. Managements judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the
known uncertainty of litigation. California Fire Litigation SanDiego County. On
June18, 2010, PAR Electrical Contractors, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta PAR, was named as a third party defendant in four lawsuits in California state court in SanDiego County, California, all of which arise out of a
wildfire in the SanDiego area that started on October21, 2007, referred to as the Witch Creek fire. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection issued a report concluding that the Witch Creek fire was started when the
conductors of a three phase 69kV transmission line, known as TL 637, owned by SanDiego Gas Electric SDGE touched each other, dropping sparks on dry grass. The Witch Creek fire, together with another wildfire referred to as
the Guejito fire that allegedly merged with the Witch Creek fire, burned a reported 198,000acres, over 1,500 homes and structures and is alleged to have caused two deaths and numerous personal injuries. 
Numerous additional lawsuits were filed directly against SDGE and its parent company, Sempra, claiming
SDGEs power lines caused the fire. The court ordered that the claims be organized into the four lawsuits mentioned above and grouped the matters by type of plaintiff, namely, insurance subrogation claimants, individual/business claimants,
governmental claimants, and a class action matter, for which class certification has since been denied. PAR is not named as a direct defendant in any of these lawsuits against SDGE or its parent. SDGE has reportedly settled many of the
claims. On June18, 2010, SDGE joined PAR to the four lawsuits as a third party defendant seeking contractual and equitable indemnification for losses related to the Witch Creek fire, although a claim for specific damages has not been
made. SDGEs claims for indemnity relate to work done by PAR involving the replacement of one pole on TL 637 about four months prior to the Witch Creek fire. Quanta does not believe that the work done by PAR was the cause of the contact
between the conductors. However, PAR has notified its various insurers of the claims. One insurer is participating in the defense of the matter, while others have reserved their rights to contest coverage, not stated their position and/or denied
coverage. One insurer filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division on April15, 2011, seeking a declaratory judgment that coverage does not exist. On June6, 2011 and June16, 2011,
two other insurers intervened in the Texas coverage lawsuit making similar claims. On August5, 2011, PAR and Quanta filed a lawsuit in California state court against certain insurers seeking a determination that coverage exists under the
policies. PAR also filed a motion in the Texas coverage lawsuit asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas to defer to the California state court on the coverage claims.On December12, 2011, the Texas court granted
PARs motion and dismissed the Texas coverage lawsuit, abstaining in favor of the pending California coverage lawsuit.The insurers have not appealed that dismissal. PAR is vigorously defending the third party claims by SDGE and
continues to work to ensure coverage of any potential liabilities. An amount equal to the deductibles under certain of Quantas applicable insurance policies has been expensed in connection with these matters. Quanta also previously recorded a
liability and corresponding insurance recovery receivable of $35 million associated with a policy that is not subject to any of the actions seeking to deny coverage, with the liability reserve being reduced as expenses are incurred in connection
with these matters and the receivable being reduced as these expenses are reimbursed by the insurance carrier. Additional deductibles may apply depending upon the availability of coverage under other insurance policies. Given PARs defenses to
the indemnity claims, as well as the potential for insurance coverage, Quanta cannot estimate the amount of any possible loss or the range of possible losses that may exceed Quantas applicable insurance coverage. However, due to the nature of
these claims, an adverse result in these proceedings leading to a significant uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
California Fire Claim Amador
County.In October 2004, a wildfire in Amador County, California, burned 16,800acres. The United States Forest Service alleged that the fire originated as a result of the activities of a Quanta subsidiary crew
performing vegetation management under a contract with Pacific Gas Electric Co. PGE. In November 2007, the United States Department of Agriculture USDA sent a written demand to the Quanta subsidiary for payment of fire
suppression costs of approximately $85 million. The USDA communicated verbally that it also intends to seek past and future restoration and other damages of approximately $513million. No litigation has been filed. PGE tendered defense
and indemnification for the matter to Quanta in 2010. The USDA, Quanta, its subsidiary and PGE have entered into a tolling agreement with respect to the filing of any litigation and are exchanging information on an informal basis. 
Quanta and its subsidiary intend to vigorously defend against any liability and damage allegations. Quanta has notified
its insurers, and two insurers are participating under a reservation of rights. Other insurers in that policy year have not stated a position regarding coverage. Quanta has recorded a liability and corresponding insurance recovery receivable of
approximately $85 million associated with this matter. Given Quantas intent to vigorously defend against the allegations and the potential for insurance coverage, Quanta cannot estimate the amount of any loss or the range of any possible
losses that might exceed its insurance coverage. However, due to the nature of these claims, an adverse result leading to a significant uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on Quantas consolidated financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows. Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Quanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and accounts
receivable, including amounts related to unbilled accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. Substantially all of Quantas cash investments are managed by what it believes to be high
credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with Quantas investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest this cash in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality investments, which consist
primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market mutual funds and investment grade commercial paper with original maturities of three months or less. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these investments is
subject to any material risk of loss, economic conditions have significantly impacted the interest income Quanta receives from these investments and is likely to continue to do so in the future. In addition, Quanta grants credit under normal payment
terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which include electric power, natural gas and pipeline companies, telecommunications service providers, governmental entities, general contractors, and builders, owners and managers of
commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the United States and Canada. Consequently, Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the United States and Canada, which may
be heightened as a result of depressed economic and financial market conditions that have existed in recent years. However, Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided. Under certain circumstances, such as
foreclosures or negotiated settlements, Quanta may take title to the underlying assets in lieu of cash in settlement of receivables. In such circumstances, extended time frames may be required to liquidate these assets, causing the amounts realized
to differ from the value of the assumed receivable. Historically, some of Quantas customers have experienced significant financial difficulties, and others may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta
to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts for services Quanta has performed. One customer accounted for approximately 11% of
consolidated revenues during the year ended December31, 2010 and approximately 12% of billed and accrued receivables at December31, 2010. Business with this customer is included in the Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services
segment. No other customers represented 10% or more of revenues for the years ended December31,2011, 2010 and 2009 or of billed and unbilled accounts receivable as of December31,2011 and 2010.

NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Self-Insurance 
Quanta is insured for employers liability, general liability, auto liability and workers compensation claims.
Since August1, 2009, all policy deductible levels are $50 million per occurrence, other than employers liability, which is subject to a deductible of $10 million. Quanta also has employee health care benefit plans for most employees
not subject to collective bargaining agreements, of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of $350,000 per claimant per year. For the policy year ended July31, 2009, employers liability claims were subject to a deductible of
$10 million per occurrence, general liability and auto liability claims were subject to a deductible of $30 million per occurrence, and workers compensation claims were subject to a deductible of $20 million per occurrence. Additionally,
for the policy year ended July31, 2009, Quantas workers compensation claims were subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to $10 million on claims in excess of $20 million per occurrence. Quantas
deductibles were generally lower in periods prior to August1, 2008. Losses under all of these insurance
programs are accrued based upon Quantas estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to
assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of Quantas liability in proportion to other parties and the number of incidents not reported. The accruals are based upon
known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate. As of December31,2011 and 2010, the gross amount accrued for insurance claims totaled $2012 million and $2168 million, with $1554 million and
$1643 million considered to be long-term and included in other non-current liabilities. Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December31,2011 and 2010 were $631 million and $663 million, of which $98 million and $94 million
are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $533 million and $569 million are included in other assets, net. Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel Quantas coverage or
determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or Quanta may elect not to obtain certain types or incremental levels of insurance if it believes that the cost to obtain such coverage is too high for the additional benefit obtained. In any such
event, Quantas overall risk exposure would increase, which could negatively affect its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Letters of Credit Certain of Quantas vendors
require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on its behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its self-funded insurance programs. In addition, from time to time some customers require Quanta to post letters of
credit to ensure payment to its subcontractors and vendors and to guarantee performance under its contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution. The letter of credit commits the issuer to pay
specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that Quanta has failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the
circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. Quanta does not believe that it is likely that any material claims will be made under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future.
As of December31,2011, Quanta had $1914 million in letters of credit outstanding under its
credit facility primarily to secure obligations under its casualty insurance program. These are irrevocable stand-by letters of credit with maturities generally expiring at various times throughout 2012. Upon maturity, it is expected that the
majority of these letters of credit will be renewed for subsequent one-year periods. 
118 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Performance Bonds and Parent Guarantees 
In certain circumstances, Quanta is required to provide performance bonds in connection with its contractual commitments.
Quanta has indemnified its sureties for any expenses paid out under these performance bonds. As of December31,2011, the total amount of outstanding performance bonds was approximately $218 billion, and the estimated cost to complete
these bonded projects was approximately $7225 million. Quanta, from time to time, guarantees the obligations
of its wholly owned subsidiaries, including obligations under certain contracts with customers, certain lease obligations and, in some states, obligations in connection with obtaining contractors licenses. Quanta is not aware of any material
obligations for performance or payment asserted against it under any of these guarantees. Employment Agreements
Quanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide
for compensation and certain other benefits and for severance payments under certain circumstances. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that become effective upon a change of control of Quanta. Quanta may be obligated to pay certain
amounts to employees upon the occurrence of any of the defined events in the various employment agreements. Collective
Bargaining Agreements Several of Quantas operating units are parties to various collective
bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. The
agreements require the operating units to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to their union employees and contribute certain amounts to multi-employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quantas multi-employer pension plan
contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements usually on an annual basis, and contributions are made to the plans on a pay-as-you-go basis based on its union employee payrolls, which cannot be
determined for future periods because the location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on the projects Quanta has ongoing at any time and the need for union
resources in connection with those projects. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 also added special funding
and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical status based on a multitude of factors
including, for example, the plans funded percentage, cash flow position and whether it is projected to experience a minimum funding deficiency. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a
funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta
contributes are in endangered, seriously endangered or critical status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such
amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans, and the amount of that future work and the number of affected employees that may be needed cannot reasonably be
estimated. Quanta may be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in
multi-employer defined benefit pension plans. For example, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an
119 Table of Contents QUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTESTO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
employer who is a contributor to a multi-employer pension plan if the employer withdraws from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities include an
allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not merely the benefits payable to a contributing employers own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for
unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. Other
than as described below, Quanta is not aware of any material amounts of withdrawal liability that have been incurred as a result of a withdrawal by any of Quantas operating units from any multi-employer defined benefit pension plans.
In the fourth quarter of 2011, Quanta recorded a partial withdrawal liability of approximately $326 million
related to the withdrawal by certain Quanta subsidiaries from the Central States Plan. The withdrawal followed an amendment to a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that eliminated obligations to
contribute to the Central States Plan, which is in critical status and is significantly underfunded as to its vested benefit obligations. The amendment was negotiated by the Pipe Line Contractors Association PLCA on behalf of its members, which
include the Quanta subsidiaries that withdrew from the Central States Plan. Quanta believed that withdrawing from the Central States Plan in the fourth quarter of 2011 was advantageous because it limited Quantas exposure to increased
liabilities from a future withdrawal if the underfunded status of the Central States Plan deteriorates further. Quanta and other PLCA members will contribute to a different multi-employer pension plan on behalf of Teamsters employees, with
contributions currently being made to an escrow fund until the new plan is finalized. The Central States Plan
has asserted that the PLCA members did not effect a withdrawal in 2011, although Quanta believes that a legally effective withdrawal occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011. If, however, the Central States Plan were to prevail in its assertions and a
withdrawal of the Quanta subsidiaries was deemed to occur after 2011, the amount of any withdrawal liability could increase substantially, although the amount of any such increase cannot yet be determined. 
The partial withdrawal liability recognized by Quanta is based on the most recent information and estimates received from
the Central States Plan for a complete withdrawal by all Quanta companies participating in the Central States Plan. Quanta expects the Central States Plan to issue a formal assessment of the partial withdrawal liability, which is expected to occur
no earlier than 2013, although timing of the assessment could be impacted by the dispute over the withdrawal asserted by the Central States Plan. Once an assessment is received, Quanta may seek to challenge and further negotiate the amount of the
assessment. As a result, the final partial withdrawal liability cannot yet be determined with certainty and could be materially higher or lower than the amount Quanta recognized in the fourth quarter of 2011. 
Certain other Quanta subsidiaries also continue to participate in the Central States Plan. Quanta is evaluating the
possibility of withdrawal of these subsidiaries from the plan, which will depend on various factors, including negotiation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements under which the subsidiaries participate and whether exemptions from
withdrawal liability applicable to construction industry employers will be available. Given the unknown nature of some of these factors, the amount or timing of any liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan
is uncertain. However, Quanta currently does not expect the incremental liability upon withdrawal of the subsidiaries remaining in the Central States Plan to be material.

Indemnities 
Quanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts, as well as other specified
liabilities, which may subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. Quanta has also indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with Quantas
previous acquisitions of certain companies. The indemnities under acquisition agreements are usually contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds. As of December31,2011, except as otherwise set
forth above in Litigation and Claims, Quanta does not believe any material liabilities for asserted claims exist against it in connection with any of these indemnity obligations. 15.
SEGMENT INFORMATION: 
Quanta presents its operations under four reportable segments:
1Electric Power Infrastructure Services, 2Natural Gas and Pipeline Infrastructure Services, 3Telecommunications Infrastructure Services and 4Fiber Optic Licensing. This structure is generally focused on broad end-user
markets for Quantas services. See Note 1 for additional information regarding Quantas reportable segments. Quantas segment results are derived from the types of services provided across its operating units in each of the end user markets described above. Quantas entrepreneurial business model
allows each of its operating units to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end user markets. Quantas operating units are organized into one of three internal divisions, namely, the electric power
division, natural gas and pipeline division and telecommunications division. These internal divisions are closely aligned with the reportable segments described above based on their operating units predominant type of work, with the operating
units providing predominantly telecommunications and fiber optic licensing services being managed within the same internal division. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating unit for the purpose of evaluating segment performance in support of Quantas
market strategies. These classifications of Quantas operating unit revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Quantas operating units may perform joint infrastructure
service projects for customers in multiple industries, deliver multiple types of network services under a single customer contract or provide service across industries, for example, joint trenching projects to install distribution lines for electric
power, natural gas and telecommunications customers. In addition, Quantas integrated operations and
common administrative support at each of its operating units requires that certain allocations, including allocations of shared and indirect costs, such as facility costs, indirect operating expenses including depreciation, and general and
administrative costs, are made to determine operating segment profitability. Corporate costs, such as payroll and benefits, employee travel expenses, facility costs, professional fees, acquisition costs and amortization related to certain intangible
assets are not allocated.
