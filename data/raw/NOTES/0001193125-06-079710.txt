BJS WHOLESALE CLUB, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Summary of
Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of BJs
Wholesale Club, Inc. BJs or the Company or we include the financial statements of all of the Companys subsidiaries, all of whose common stock is wholly owned by the Company.  Fiscal Year  Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. The fiscal years
ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 each included 52 weeks.  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities  We consider highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities exceeding three months are classified as marketable securities.
Our marketable securities, which consist of high-grade debt
securities issued by state governmental agencies or their political subdivisions, are classified as available for sale and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.  Accounts Receivable  Accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card receivables and vendor rebates and allowances and are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts
of $879,000 at January 28, 2006 and $616,000 at January 29, 2005. The determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on BJs historical experience applied to an aging of accounts and a review of individual accounts with a known
potential for write-off.  Merchandise Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined
under the average cost method, or market. We recognize the write-down of slow-moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write-downs are probable and estimable. We recognize a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between
physical inventories based on historical results of previous physical inventories, shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Property and Equipment  Property is depreciated by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Buildings are depreciated over 33 1/3 years. Leasehold costs
and improvements are amortized over the required lease term which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Leasehold costs and improvements that are placed in service significantly
after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term are amortized over the term that includes the required lease term and renewal periods that are reasonably assured or their estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. Furniture,
fixtures and equipment are depreciated over three to ten years. Interest related to the development of buildings is capitalized to the extent that debt is incurred during the construction period.  Normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
31  Impairment of Long-lived Assets  We review the realizability of our long-lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews. For purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long-lived assets, the
recoverability test is performed using undiscounted net cash flows of individual clubs and consolidated net cash flows for long-lived assets not identifiable to individual clubs. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying
amount and the fair value of the impaired assets held for use.  We recorded pretax asset impairment charges of $13,000 in 2005, $2,387,000 in 2004 and $2,342,000 in 2003 to write down leasehold improvements and certain fixtures and equipment to fair value at underperforming clubs that were projected to
have future cash flow losses. The fair value of the assets was based primarily on past experience in disposing of similar assets. Asset impairment charges are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.  Self-Insurance Reserves  We are primarily self-insured for workers compensation and general
liability claims. Reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue from the sale of merchandise, net of estimated returns,
at the time of purchase by the customer in the club. In the limited instances when the customer is not able to take delivery at the point of sale, revenue from the sale of merchandise is not recognized until title and risk of loss pass to the
customer. Membership fee revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the membership, which is typically twelve months.  In determining comparable club information, we include all clubs that were open for at least 13 months at the beginning of the period and were in
operation during all of both periods being compared. However, if a club is in the process of closing, it is excluded from comparable clubs. We include relocated clubs and expansions in comparable clubs.  Vendor Rebates and Allowances  We receive various types of cash consideration from vendors, principally in
the form of rebates based on purchasing or selling certain volumes of product; time-based rebates or allowances, which may include product placement allowances or exclusivity arrangements covering a predetermined period of time; price protection
rebates and allowances for retail reductions on certain merchandise; and salvage allowances for product that is damaged, defective or becomes out-of-date. We recognize such vendor rebates and allowances based on a systematic and rational allocation
of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by BJs toward earning the rebates and allowances, provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable. Otherwise, rebates and
allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met. We recognize product placement allowances as a reduction of cost of sales in the period in which we complete the arranged placement of the product. Time-based rebates or
allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales over the performance period on a straight-line basis. All other vendor rebates and allowances are realized as a reduction of cost of sales when the merchandise is sold or otherwise disposed.
We also receive cash consideration from vendors for
demonstrating their products in the clubs and for advertising their products, particularly in the BJs Journal, a publication sent to BJs members throughout the year. In both cases, such cash consideration is recognized as a
reduction of selling, general and administrative 
32  
SGA expenses to the extent it represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable SGA costs incurred by BJs to
sell the vendors products. If the cash consideration exceeds the costs being reimbursed, the excess is characterized as a reduction of cost of sales. Cash consideration for product demonstrations is recognized in the period during which the
demonstrations are performed. Cash consideration for advertising vendors products is recognized in the period in which the advertising takes place.  Manufacturers Incentives Tendered by Consumers  At the beginning of 2004, we adopted the provisions of EITF Issue No03-10, Application of EITF Issue No02-16 by Resellers to Sales
Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers EITF 03-10, which provides guidance for the reporting of vendor consideration received by a reseller as it relates to manufacturers incentives such as rebates or coupons
tendered by consumers. We include such vendor consideration in revenues only if all of the criteria defined in EITF 03-10 are met. Otherwise, such consideration is recorded as a decrease in cost of sales.  Rent Expenses  Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the term of the leases. We begin recognizing rent expense in the preopening period when we take possession of the club. Our owned buildings, including those located on leased land, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 331/3 years. We calculate rent for ground leases over periods that equal or exceed the time periods for depreciation of
the buildings, which would include reasonably assured lease renewal periods.  Preopening Costs  Preopening costs consist of direct incremental costs of opening or relocating a facility and are charged to operations as incurred.  Advertising Costs  Advertising costs generally consist of promoting new memberships and new store openings and also include during the holiday season television and radio
advertising some of which is vendor-funded. BJs expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expenses were less than 040% of total sales in each of the last three years.  Legal Costs  Legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are recognized at the same time that the loss contingency is recorded.
Stock-Based Compensation  As of January28, 2006, we had two stock-based employee compensation
plans, which are described more fully in Note H. We account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. No
stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant. We do include
stock-based employee compensation cost for restricted stock in net income. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amount
of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of marketable securities approximates fair value because of their interest rate reset feature,
which typically adjusts to market rates every 35 days.  The
carrying amount of long-term debt, including current installments, was $3,197,000 and $3,625,000 as of January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. The fair value of this debt was $3,342,000 and $3,920,000 as of January28,
2006 and January29, 2005, respectively. Fair value was based on our estimate of current rates on debt with similar remaining maturities for companies with credit ratings similar to BJs.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued the
following standards which become effective in 2006:  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123 R revises FASB Statement No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance.  This statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments
for goods or services, and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. 
Through 2005, we accounted for stock-based employee compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25. In
accordance with that standard, no stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options has been reflected in our statements of income. In accordance with the provisions of the original SFAS No123, we have disclosed, on a pro forma basis,
the effect on net income had we applied the provisions of that statement to stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No123R requires us to recognize stock option expense in our statements of income beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2006 and to
estimate the effect of stock option forfeitures. Through 2005, as permitted by the original SFAS No123, we have accounted for forfeitures as they occur. In addition, SFAS 123R amends FASB Statement No95, Statements of Cash
Flows, to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. 
34  As of the beginning of our first fiscal quarter in 2006 the required effective date, we
will apply the provisions of SFAS 123R to new stock awards and to awards modified, repurchased or canceled after the required effective date. Additionally, compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been
rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the service is rendered on or after that date. The compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the fair value of those awards as calculated for
pro forma disclosure purposes under the original SFAS No123.  We estimate that stock option expense in 2006 will be approximately $10 to $12 million post-tax. The actual amount of stock option expense may vary materially from this estimate, due to certain factors, including number of options that will
actually be issued, the timing of option grants, and the market price of our stock on the date of grant. We intend to apply the modified retrospective application transition method.  Most of BJs stock option awards specify that eligible participants whose employment terminates on or after their
normal retirement date as defined may exercise options within the period of one year following their termination. Shares shall continue to become exercisable during this period in accordance with the stock option agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, options shall in no event be exercisable after the final exercise date. For pro forma reporting purposes under SFAS No. 123, we recognize compensation cost for this type of arrangement over the nominal vesting period the nominal
vesting period approach. Issue 19 of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB 25 and FIN 44, EITF 00-23 and paragraph 27 of SFAS 123 specify that an award is
vested when the employees retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service the non-substantive vesting period approach.  We will continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for any new awards granted prior to adopting SFAS 123R and
for the remaining portion of unvested outstanding awards. Upon adopting SFAS 123R, we will apply the non-substantive vesting approach described in paragraphs A57-58 of SFAS 123R to new grants that have retirement eligibility provisions. Applying
the non-substantive vesting approach instead of the nominal vesting approach would have increased post-tax stock option expense by approximately $12 million in 2005, $10 million in 2004 and $08 million in 2003.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No151, Inventory Costs, amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing, to clarify that
abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and spoilage should be recognized as current-period charges. The provisions of SFAS No151 become effective for BJs at the beginning of 2006. We believe that the
adoption of SFAS No151 will not have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections-a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and SFAS No3, requires retrospective application to prior
periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so. When it is impracticable to determine the effect on all prior periods, this statement requires that the new principle be applied to the
earliest period practicable. This statement carries forward without change the guidance in APB Opinion No. 20 for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimates. SFAS No154
shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning in 2006. We expect that adoption of SFAS No154 will not have a material impact on our financial statements.  Estimates Included in Financial Statements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
35  A.Accounting Principle Change  During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS No143. SFAS No143 requires us to recognize future costs for asset retirements to be incurred. We recorded a
post-tax charge of $1,253,000 after reduction for income taxes of $776,000, or $02 per diluted share, to reflect the cumulative effect of adopting this accounting principle change as of the beginning of the fiscal year, primarily in connection
with the future removal of gasoline tanks from our gasoline stations.  The pro forma amounts shown at the bottom of the statements of income reflect net income and earnings per share as if SFAS No143 had been in effect during each period presented.  The following is a summary of activity relating to our liability for asset
retirement obligations:  Fiscal Year Ended January28,2006

B.Spin-off of the Company from Waban Inc. and Related Party Transactions  The Company, which previously had been a wholly owned subsidiary of Waban
Inc. Waban, became a separate and independent public entity on July28, 1997, when Waban distributed to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the Companys outstanding common stock the spin-off.
Pursuant to the spin-off, BJs and Waban entered into a
Tax Sharing Agreement to provide for the payment of taxes and the entitlement to tax refunds for periods prior to the spin-off date. Each party has agreed to indemnify the other in specified circumstances if certain events occurring after
July28, 1997 cause the spin-off or certain related transactions to become taxable.  C.Gain or Loss on Contingent Lease Obligations and Discontinued Operations  In connection with the spin-off of Waban by The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX in 1989, Waban and TJX entered into an agreement pursuant to which
Waban agreed to indemnify TJX against any liabilities that TJX might incur with respect to 41 House2Home leases as to which TJX was either a lessee or guarantor. Pursuant to a subsequent agreement, BJs agreed to indemnify TJX for 100% of
House2Homes lease liabilities through January31, 2003 and for 50% of any such liabilities thereafter.  House2Home filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on November7, 2001. In 2001, we recorded a pretax charge of
$1050 million for our estimated loss associated with House2Home leases. On a post-tax basis, this charge was $630 million.  Based on our continuing evaluation of our remaining obligations and our success in settling liabilities for House2Home leases, we recorded pretax gains of
$01 million in 2005, $27 million in 2004 and $55 million in 2003 to reduce our estimated liability related to House2Home contingent lease obligations.  On November9, 2002, we closed both of our clubs in the Columbus, Ohio, market and an older non-prototypical club in North Dade, Florida. The
operating results of these clubs are presented in discontinued operations in the statements of income for all periods presented. In 2002, we recorded pretax club closing costs of $21,387,000 $12,832,000 post-tax and pretax operating losses of
$3,405,000 $2,111,000 post-tax. There were no revenues after 2002. 
36  In the second quarter of 2005, we settled the lease for one of the closed BJs clubs through a lump
sum settlement. The settlement was consistent with the amount which we had reserved for this club. Loss from discontinued operations in 2005 consisted entirely of interest accretion charges of $514,000 pretax $309,000 post-tax. In 2004, we made a
lump sum payment to settle the lease for one of the clubs that closed in 2002. Based on the settlement and an evaluation of the status of the two remaining clubs, we recorded a pretax charge of $2,853,000 to increase our reserve for closed clubs.
Including pretax accretion charges of $785,000, the pretax loss from discontinued operations totaled $3,638,000 in 2004. On a post-tax basis, this loss was $2,183,000. Loss from discontinued operations in 2003 consisted of pretax accretion charges
of $946,000 and an increase in the reserves of $180,000 for the write-off of additional long-lived assets. On a post-tax basis, these charges amounted to $676,000.  The following is a summary of activity relating to our obligations for House2Home and BJs closed store leases:
Fiscal Year Ended January28,2006 January29,2005 January31,2004 Dollars in Thousands Reserves for closed store liabilities, beginning of year 15,991 21,911 58,334 Provision for increase decrease to reserves 110 203 5,320 Interest accretion charges 514 977 1,958 Cash payments 7,441 7,100 33,061 Reserves for closed store liabilities, end of year 8,954 15,991 21,911  As of January28,
2006, we have settled all 41 House2Home leases for which we were originally contingently liable, including lump sum settlements for 38 leases. The other three House2Home properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to
third parties. Two of the leases for the three BJs clubs closed in November 2002 have been settled. We have reserved a total of $8,954,000 associated with our obligations for the remaining lease as of January28, 2006.  We believe that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements
adequately provide for this lease obligation. However, there can be no assurance that our actual liability for the closed store obligation will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors,
including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease, assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to this property. We consider our maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for our closed store
lease obligations to be approximately $21 million at January28, 2006.  D.Debt  As of
January28, 2006, long-term debt, less the portion due within one year, consisted entirely of real estate debt, bearing interest at 7%, maturing through November1, 2011. The real estate debt has a prepayment penalty. The aggregate
maturities of long-term debt outstanding at January28, 2006 were as follows:  Fiscal Years Ending

Later years 540 Total 2,737  Real estate debt was
collateralized by land and buildings with a net book value of $9,826,000. 
37  On April28, 2005, we entered into a new $225 million unsecured credit agreement with a group of
banks which expires April27, 2010. The new agreement includes a $50 million sub-facility for letters of credit, of which $23 million was outstanding at January28, 2006. We are required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently
015% of the total commitment. Interest on borrowings is payable at BJs option either at athe Eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently 0475% or ba rate equal to the higher of ithe sum of the Federal Funds
Effective Rate plus 050% or iithe agent banks prime rate. We are also required to pay a usage fee whenever the amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds 50% of the total commitment. The usage
fee, if applicable, would be at an annual rate of 0125% of the amount borrowed. The facility fee and Eurodollar margin are subject to change based upon our fixed charge coverage ratio. The agreement contains financial covenants which include a
minimum fixed charge coverage requirement and a maximum adjusted debt to capital limitation. We are required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis. Under the credit agreement, we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any
amount so long as we remain in compliance with all requirements under the agreement. We have no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement. We were in compliance
with the covenants and other requirements set forth in our credit agreement at January28, 2006.  In addition to the credit agreement, we maintain a separate $62 million facility for letters of credit, primarily to support the purchase of inventories,
of which $366 million was outstanding at January28, 2006, and also maintain a $25 million uncommitted credit line for short-term borrowings which expires on September30, 2006.  There were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our
uncommitted credit line at January28, 2006 and January29, 2005.  E.Commitments and Contingencies  We are obligated under long-term leases for the rental of real estate. In addition, we are generally required to pay insurance, real estate taxes and other operating expenses and, in some cases, additional rentals
based on a percentage of sales in excess of certain amounts, or other factors. Many of our leases require escalating payments during the lease term. Rent expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The initial
primary term of our real estate leases excluding ground leases ranges from 4 to 25 years. Most of these leases have an initial term of 20 years. The initial primary term of our ground leases ranges from 15 to 44 years, and averages approximately
25 years. As of January28, 2006, we have options to renew all but one of our leases for periods that range from 5 to 50 years, and average approximately 21 years. Future minimum lease payments as of January28, 2006 were:  Fiscal Years Ending

Later years 1,570,871 Total 2,247,086  We corrected our
methods of accounting related to the timing of rent expense recognition at our leased locations, and for recognizing rent expenses for certain of our ground leases, in the fourth quarter of 2004. As a result of these changes, we recorded cumulative,
non-cash charges of $58 million to begin recognizing rent expenses when we take possession of our clubs, and $14 million to adjust rent for our ground leases, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Of the $72 million recorded for these charges, $475,000
was related to 2004 and the remainder is related to prior years. The effect of this adjustment was to increase preopening expenses by $82 million and to decrease cost of sales, including buying and occupancy costs, by $10 million. See
Summary of Accounting Policies Property and Equipment and Rent Expenses for additional information. 
38  Financial results for prior periods were not restated due to the immateriality of these issues to the
results of operations and statements of financial position for the current year and each prior year. These charges will not affect historical or future cash flows, nor will they affect the timing or amounts of payments for the related leases.
The payments above do not include future payments due under
the lease for one BJs club which was closed in November 2002. Rent liabilities for the closed club is included in the balance sheet see Note C for additional information.  Rental expense under operating leases including contingent rentals, which were not material amounted to $120,197,000 114,984,000 and $102,735,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rental expense in 2004 included corrections to our accounting for leases of $72 million, $67 million of which was related to prior years.  We are involved in various legal proceedings that are typical of a retail
business. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these proceedings or any related claims, we believe that such proceedings or claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
or results of operations.  BJs has filed proofs of claim
against House2Home, Inc. for claims arising under certain agreements between BJs and House2Home in connection with the Companys spin-off from Waban Inc. in July 1997. These claims arise primarily from BJs indemnification of TJX
with respect to TJXs guarantee of House2Home leases and from the Tax Sharing Agreement dated July28, 1997 between BJs and House2Home. House2Home and BJs have settled BJs claims against House2Home. The settlement
provides that BJs will have an unsecured claim of approximately $38 million, on account of claims under the Tax Sharing Agreement and indemnification payments which have been made to TJX. The settlement agreement was approved by the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California on November10, 2003. As part of the settlement, BJs has been released of all claims that House2Home and its bankruptcy estate may have had against BJs, including $17
million owed by BJs to House2Home under the Tax Sharing Agreement. We recognized this amount as a reduction in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2003.  During 2005, we received pretax recoveries on account of our House2Home bankruptcy claims of $44 million. These recoveries
are recorded in gain on contingent lease obligations in the statement of income. On a post-tax basis, these gains totaled $30 million.  During 2004, we received pretax recoveries on account of our House2Home bankruptcy claims totaling $70 million, including a payment of $25 million to
settle our claim against the Indenture Trustee for House2Homes Convertible Subordinated Notes. We have no further claims against the Indenture Trustee. These recoveries are also included in gain on contingent lease obligations in the
statements of income. On a post-tax basis these gains totaled $46 million.  In March 2006, we received bankruptcy recoveries of $31 million on account of our House2Home bankruptcy claims. On a post-tax basis, these gains were $21 million. The Bankruptcy Court has closed our case and we do
not expect to receive further payments on our claims. The recoveries that we received in March 2006 will be recorded in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending February3, 2007.  As permitted by Delaware law, BJs has entered into agreements whereby it indemnifies its directors and officers for
certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving, at the Companys request, in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments that BJs could be required to make under these agreements is not
limited. However, BJs carries directors and officers insurance that covers its exposure up to certain limits. As a result of our insurance coverage, we believe that the estimated fair value of our indemnification agreements with
directors and officers is minimal. No liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of January28, 2006. 
39  In 2002, we began to offer an extended warranty on tires sold at our clubs, under which BJs
customers receive tire repair services or tire replacement in certain circumstances. We have insured this liability through a third party and, therefore, retain no liability in connection with the tire warranty program other than for the premiums
paid to the third-party carrier.  F.Provision for
Credit Card Claims  Early in 2004 we were notified by
credit card issuers that credit and debit card accounts used legitimately at BJs were subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non-BJs locations. In response, we retained a leading computer security firm to conduct a forensic
analysis of our information technology systems with a goal of determining whether a breach had in fact occurred. While no conclusive evidence of a breach was found, the computer security firm concluded that: 1our centralized computer system
that serves as the aggregation point for all BJs credit and debit card transactions chain-wide had not been breached and 2any breach would have likely occurred in a more decentralized fashion involving club-level systems. On
March12, 2004, after our receipt of the computer security firms preliminary report of findings, we issued a public statement alerting consumers to the potential security breach.  In 2004, we recorded charges of $70 million $42 million post-tax to
establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards, monitoring expenses and related fees and expenses.  In 2005, we recorded additional charges of $40 million $24 million post-tax to increase our reserve. These charges were
driven primarily by an increase in our estimate of legal costs to be incurred in connection with this matter. As of January28, 2006, the balance in the reserve was $45 million, which represented our best estimate of the remaining cost and
expenses related to this matter at that time. This reserve is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet.  In connection with this matter, on September20, 2005 the Company entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission FTC,
which has jurisdiction over consumer protection matters. The full text of the consent decree can be found on the FTCs website. In summary, BJs has not admitted any wrongdoing or that the facts alleged in the FTCs complaint are
true. Under the consent decree, BJs will pay no fines or damages. BJs has agreed, however, to maintain a comprehensive information security program, much of which was put in place shortly after BJs first learned of the possible
compromise, and to a biannual assessment of that program by an independent third party.  As of March31, 2006, the amount of outstanding claims, which are primarily from credit card issuing banks, was approximately $13 million. We are unable to predict whether further claims will be asserted. We have
contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims made against us and continue to explore our defenses and possible claims against others.  The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ from the amounts recorded. While that difference could be material to the results of operations for any
affected reporting period, it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or liquidity.  G.Capital Stock  During 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $100 million of the Companys common stock in addition to the $400
million previously authorized. We repurchased 2,535,600 shares of our common stock for $73,233,898 in 2005 and 1,725,200 shares for $45,318,000 in 2004. We did not repurchase any stock in 2003. As of January28, 2006, the Companys
remaining repurchase authorization was $71,905,000.  BJs
has a shareholder rights plan, originally adopted in 1997 and amended in 1999 and in 2003 solely to appoint a new rights agent, pursuant to which shareholders are issued one-half of a Right for each share of 
40  
common stock. Each Right entitles the holder to purchase from the Company 1/1000 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock Series A
Preferred Stock at a price of $120. BJs has designated 100,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for issuance under the shareholder rights plan; none has been issued to date. Generally, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are
designed so that 1/1000 share of Series A Preferred Stock is the economic equivalent of one share of BJs common stock. The Rights are exercisable only if a person acquires 20% or more of the Companys common stock or commences a tender
offer that would result in such person owning 30% or more of the Companys common stock. In addition, in general, if after a person has become a 20% owner, BJs is involved in a business combination transaction in which it is not the
surviving corporation or in connection with which the BJs common stock is changed, or BJs disposes of 50% or more of its assets or earning power, each Right that has not previously been exercised or voided will entitle its holder to
purchase that number of shares of common stock of such other person which equals $120 divided by one-half of the then current market price of such common stock. BJs will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights at $01 per Right at any time
until the tenth business day following public announcement that a person has become a 20% owner. The Rights expire on July10, 2007, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged.  The Company has authorized 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par value, of which no shares have been issued.
In December 1997, one of BJs subsidiaries issued 126
shares of non-voting preferred stock to individual stockholders at $2,200 per share. These shares are each entitled to receive ongoing annual dividends of $200 per share. The minority interest in this subsidiary is equal to the preferred
shares preference in an involuntary liquidation of $277,200 and is included in other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005.  H.Stock Incentive Plans  Under its 1997 Stock Incentive Plan, BJs has granted certain key
employees and directors options to purchase common stock at prices equal to 100% of market price on the grant date. These options, which generally expire ten years from the grant date, are generally exercisable 25%per year starting one year
after the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors expire ten years from the grant date, but are exercisable in three equal annual installments beginning on the first day of the month which includes the first anniversary of the date of
grant. At the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2004, an amendment to increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan by 4,000,000 shares was approved. Certain sub-limits were also approved for
awards from and after the date of the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including a limit of 1,000,000 shares with respect to awards other than options and stock appreciation rights and a limit of 300,000 shares with respect to awards granted to
non-employee directors. The maximum number of shares of common stock issuable under this plan is now 11,249,402 shares, plus shares subject to awards granted under the BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. 1997 Replacement Stock Incentive Plan the
Replacement Plan which are not actually issued because such awards expire or are canceled. Under the Replacement Plan, BJs employees who held Waban stock options and restricted stock were granted replacement BJs options and
restricted stock, which preserved the same inherent value, vesting terms and expiration dates as the Waban awards they replaced in connection with the spin-off. No new options could be granted under the Replacement Plan after January28, 1998.
At the 2003 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held
on May22, 2003, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to BJs 1997 Stock Incentive Plan to permit a stock option exchange program under which outstanding stock options having an exercise price greater than $2900 per share
would be exchanged for new options. The new options would be exercisable for one-half the number of shares of exchanged options and would have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of BJs common stock on the date of the grant, which
would be at least six months and one day after cancellation of the exchanged options. BJs directors, President/Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Presidents were not eligible to participate in the program.  On May27, 2003, the expiration date of the Companys exchange
offer, the Company accepted for exchange from eligible employees options to purchase an aggregate of 1,307,385 shares of BJs common stock. 
41  
These stock options were cancelled as of that date. On November28, 2003, the Company issued new options to purchase 646,054 shares of BJs common
stock in exchange for the options surrendered in the offer. The exercise price of these new options is $2545, which was equal to the fair market value of BJs common stock on November28, 2003. None of the new options vested or became
exercisable until May28, 2004. Beginning on May28, 2004, the new options immediately vested to the same extent that the options they replaced would have been vested on that date had they not been surrendered. After May28, 2004, the
new options have the same vesting schedule and the same remaining term as the options they replaced.  As of January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively, 1,896,691 and 2,763,385 shares were reserved for all future stock awards under
BJs stock incentive plans. As of January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, respectively, of the total shares reserved, a maximum of 847,000 and 862,500 shares were reserved for awards other than options and stock appreciation rights,
and a maximum of 220,000 and 255,000 shares were reserved for awards for non-employee directors.  We apply APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for our stock-based compensation. Total pretax compensation cost recognized in the statements of
income for stock-based employee compensation awards was $1,314,000 in 2005, $672,000 in 2004 and $89,000 in 2003, and consisted entirely of restricted stock expense, which is charged to income ratably over the periods during which the restrictions
lapse. 23,000 shares of restricted stock were issued in 2005 at a weighted-average grant date value of $2928; 137,500 shares of restricted stock were issued in 2004 at a weighted-average grant date value of $2266; and 5,000 shares of restricted
stock were issued in 2003 at a weighted-average grant date value of $2282. Restricted shares granted in the last three years were issued at no cost and have a service condition only. 7,500 restricted shares were returned to the Companys
treasury in 2005. No compensation cost has been recognized under APB 25 for BJs stock options because the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.  The table that follows illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock- Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation, including stock options. The fair
value for stock options was estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 373%, 346% and 295%, in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively;
volatility factor of the expected market price of BJs common stock of 38 in 2005 and 46 in 2004 and 2003; and expected life of the options of 5 years in 2005, 49 years in 2004 and 46 years in 2003. No dividends were expected. The
weighted-average fair value of options granted was $1167 in 2005, $1118 in 2004, and $937 in 2003. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period and
forfeitures are recognized when they occur.

42  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.  Presented below is a summary of the status of stock option activity and

established a valuation allowance because our deferred tax assets can be utilized by offsetting deferred tax liabilities and future taxable income, which management believes will more likely than not be earned, based on our historical earnings
record and projected future earnings.  K.Retirement
Plans  Under BJs 401k Savings plans, participating
employees may make pretax contributions up to 50% of covered compensation, subject to statutory limits. BJs matches employee contributions at 100% of the first one percent of covered compensation and 50% of the next four percent. The
Companys expense under these plans was $4,903,000, $4,177,000 and $3,555,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  We have a non-contributory defined contribution retirement plan for certain key employees. Under this plan, BJs funds annual retirement
contributions for the designated participants on an after-tax basis. For the last three years, the Companys contributions equaled 5% of the participants base salary. Participants become fully vested in their contribution accounts at the
end of the fiscal year in which they complete four years of service. Our pretax expense under this plan was $1,565,000, $1,441,000 and $1,179,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 
45  L.Postretirement Medical Benefits  We have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan which covers employees
and their spouses who retire after age 55 with at least 10 years of service, who are not eligible for Medicare, and who participated in a Company-sponsored medical plan. Amounts contributed by retired employees under this plan are based on years of
service prior to retirement. The plan is not funded. The discount rates presented in the tables below were selected by referencing yields on high quality corporate bonds, including Moodys Aa Corporate Bond Rate and the Citigroup Pension Yield
Curve.  Net periodic postretirement medical benefit cost

49  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc.:
We have completed integrated audits of BJs
Wholesale Club, Inc.s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of January28, 2006 and an audit of its 2004 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.  Consolidated financial statements  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index,present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of BJs Wholesale Club, Inc. and its subsidiaries at January28, 2006 and January29, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January28, 2006 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  As discussed in Note A to the financial statements, the Company adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, on February2, 2003.  Internal control over financial reporting  Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
Item8, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January28, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of January28, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, 
50  
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  /S/PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts April12, 2006  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  BJs management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of January28, 2006. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on its assessment, management concluded that, as of January28, 2006, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has audited the Companys assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of January28, 2006 as stated in their report, which appears herein.  April12, 2006 
51 Item1B.Unresolved Staff Comments  None.  Item2.
Controls and Procedures  The Companys management, with the participation of the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of January28, 2006. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of January28, 2006, the Companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date,
the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  Managements report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange
Act and the independent registered public accounting firms related audit report are included in Item8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.  No change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended
January28, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
