The financial data included in the financial statement schedule
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements. All other schedules have been omitted because they
are not applicable or the required information is shown in the
consolidated financial statements or notes thereto. 20 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bell Industries, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Bell Industries, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2005 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
UnitedStates of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has restated its 2004 and 2003
consolidated financial statements.

See Accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 25 BELL INDUSTRIES, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Summary of Accounting Policies Principles of consolidation The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Restatement The Company has restated certain
amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December31,
2004 and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years
ended December31, 2004 and 2003 to correct an error in the
classification of the Companys floor plan arrangements
with third party finance companies. Previously, the Company
reported borrowings and repayments of floor plan financings with
third party finance companies in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows as operating activities. The Consolidated Statement
of Cash Flows has been restated to include these amounts in cash
flows from financing activities. For the year ended
December31, 2004, this change had the effect of increasing
net cash provided by operating activities and increasing net
cash used in financing activities. For the year ended
December31, 2003 this change had the effect of decreasing
net cash provided by operating activities and increasing net
cash provided by financing activities. Additionally, floor plan
payables are being presented as a separate line item in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet instead of the previous presentation
within accounts payable. A summary of the effects of the restatement follows

Cash and cash equivalents The Company
considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity date of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Included in cash and cash equivalents are repurchase agreements
which are transactions involving the purchase of a security and
the simultaneous commitment to return the security to the seller
at an agreed upon price on an agreed upon date. These agreements
mature the following day and the Company is paid principal plus
interest. The U.S. Government Agency securities committed in
these agreements are segregated by a 26 third party custodian under the Companys name and serve as
collateral under such agreement. As of December31, 2005
and 2004, these transactions amounted to approximately
$73million and $103million, respectively. Based on
the maturity date of the resell agreements, the Company
considers that the amounts presented in the financial statements
are reasonable estimates of fair value. Revenue recognition and receivables The
Companys operations include sales of technology products
and managed lifecycle services Technology Solutions
or BTL; sales of aftermarket products for
recreational vehicles, motorcycles and ATVs, snowmobiles and
powerboats Recreational Products or
RPG; and manufacturing and sales of specialty
electronic components Electronic Components or
JWM. Revenues are recognized when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment of products has
occurred or services have been rendered, the sales price charged
is fixed or determinable, and the collection of the resulting
receivable is reasonably assured. The following summarizes the
underlying terms of sales arrangements at each of the
Companys reporting segments   
Technology Solutions   
BTLs product sales terms provide that title and risk of
loss are passed to the customer at the time of shipment. These
sales terms have been enforced with BTLs customers. An
order or a signed agreement is required for each transaction.
Products are typically shipped directly to customers from
BTLs suppliers. In some instances, products are shipped to
customers out of BTL facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana
and Richmond, Virginia. BTLs services revenues are
primarily derived through support services from recurring
engagements. BTLs support services are typically rendered
separate from product sales. Revenues from these services are
typically under contract and are billed periodically, usually
monthly, based on fixed fee arrangements, per incident or per
resource charges, or on a cost plus basis. Revenue recognition
from support services does not require significant management
estimates. Revenue is recognized in accordance with Emerging
Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No00-21 for
arrangements that include multiple deliverables, primarily
product sales that include deployment services. The delivered
items are accounted for separately, provided that the delivered
item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis and there
is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered items. For such arrangements, product sales and
deployment services are accounted for separately in accordance
with EITF Issue
No00-21.     
In accordance with EITF Issue No99-19, the Company
records revenue either based on the gross amount billed to a
customer or the net amount retained. The Company records revenue
on a gross basis when it acts as a principal in the transaction,
is the primary obligor in the arrangement, establishes prices,
determines the supplier, and has credit risk. The Company
records revenue on a net basis when the supplier is the primary
obligor in the arrangement, when the amount earned is a
percentage of the total transaction value and is usually
received directly from the supplier, and when the supplier has
credit risk. Product sales to most customers are recorded on a
gross basis as the Company is responsible for fulfilling the
order, establishes the selling price to the customer, has the
responsibility to pay suppliers for all products ordered,
regardless of when, or if, it collects from the customer, and
determines the credit worthiness of its customers.   
Recreational Products Group   
RPGs sales terms provide that title and risk of loss are
passed to the customer at time of shipment. These sales terms
have been enforced with RPGs customers. Sales terms are
communicated in each of RPGs product catalogues, which are
widely distributed to customers. An order is required for each
transaction. Products are shipped to customers based on their
proximity to each of RPGs distribution facilities in
Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Over 95% of products are
shipped out of one of these three distribution facilities.
Delivery is fulfilled through either common carriers, local
shipping companies or in the case of same day deliveries to
local customers, through Company-owned vehicles. For over 90% of
sales transactions, delivery occurs within one day of shipment. 27   
Electronic Components   
JWMs sales terms provide that title and risk of loss are
passed to the customer at the time of shipment. These sales
terms have been enforced with JWMs customers. An order is
required for each transaction. Over 90% of the products are
shipped to customers out of a facility in Gardena, California.
Shipments are fulfilled through the carrier selected by the
customer. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
are generally limited due to the large number and general
dispersion of trade accounts, which constitute the
Companys customer base. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the
Company had one Technology Solutions customer, Philip Morris
USA, that accounted for approximately 10%, 14% and 10% of
consolidated net revenues, respectively. At December31,
2005 and 2004, this customer accounted for approximately 17% and
13% of accounts receivable, respectively. Another technology
solutions customer totaled approximately 13% and 6% of accounts
receivable at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral. The Company estimates
reserves for potential credit losses and such losses have been
within these estimates. Inventories Inventories, consisting primarily
of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost determined
using weighted average and
first-in, first-out
methods or market net realizable value. Shipping and handling costs Shipping and
handling costs, consisting primarily of freight paid to
carriers, Company-owned delivery vehicle expenses and payroll
related costs incurred in connection with storing, moving,
preparing, and delivering products totaled approximately
$35million in 2005, $37million in 2004 and
$34million in 2003. These costs are included within
selling and administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. Deferred catalog and advertising costs The
Company capitalizes the direct cost of producing its RPG product
catalogs. Upon completion of each catalog, the production costs
are amortized over the expected net sales period of one year.
Deferred catalog costs totaled approximately $70,000 at
December31, 2005 and 2004. Total consolidated advertising
costs, which are expensed as incurred, and amortized catalog
production costs, totaled approximately $300,000 in 2005 250,000 in 2004 and $250,000 in 2003. Vendor rebates The Company receives rebates
from certain vendors. Rebates are deemed earned based on meeting
volume purchasing or other criteria established by the vendor.
These amounts are recorded at the time the requirements are
considered met or at the time that the credit is received from
the vendor if collectibility risks or other issues exist. Fixed assets, depreciation and amortization
All fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives of
10years for building improvements, 3 to 5years for
computer equipment and software and 3 to 7years for
furniture, fixtures and other. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of their estimated service lives or
the term of the lease. Long-lived assets In accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the Company
assesses potential impairments to its long-lived assets when
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be fully recoverable. If required, an impairment
loss is recognized as the difference between the carrying value
and the fair value of the assets. Income taxes Provision is made for the tax
effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting
basis and the tax basis of the Companys assets and
liabilities. In estimating deferred tax balances, the Company
considers all expected future events other than enactments of
changes in the tax law or rates. Avaluation allowance is
recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accrued liabilities The Company accrues for
liabilities associated with disposed businesses, including
amounts related to legal, environmental and contractual matters.
In connection with these matters, the recorded liabilities
include an estimate of legal fees to be incurred. These legal
fees are charged against the 28 recorded liability when incurred. Accrued liabilities include
approximately $42million and $43million of amounts
attributable to disposed businesses at December31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Environmental matters The Company accrues for
losses associated with environmental remediation obligations
when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Such
accruals are adjusted as further information develops or
circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation
costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their
receipt is deemed probable. Costs of future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations and expected recoveries
from other parties are not discounted to their present value. Retiree medical program The Company accounts
for its postretirement medical obligations in accordance with
SFASNo106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The Company
contributes a defined amount towards medical coverage to
qualifying employees who were employed prior to January1,
1998. Comprehensive income loss Comprehensive
loss is the same as net loss for all periods presented. Stock-based compensation The Company grants
stock options for a fixed number of shares to certain employees
and directors with an exercise price equal to or greater than
the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The Company
accounts for stock option grants in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion APB No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations, and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation
expense for the stock option grants. The following table
illustrates the effect on net loss and net loss per share, for
each of the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,

Use of estimates The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Some of the more significant estimates relate to the
realizable value of accounts receivable, the realizable value of
inventories and reserves associated with disposed businesses.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 29 New pronouncements In December 2004, the FASB
issued SFASNo123 revised 2004 Share-Based
Payment. SFASNo123 revised 2004 revises
SFASNo123 and APB No25 and related
interpretations. SFASNo123 revised 2004 requires
compensation cost relating to all share-based payments to
employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on
their fair values in the first interim or annual reporting
period beginning after June15, 2005 either on a
retroactive or a prospective basis. The proforma
disclosures previously permitted under SFASNo123
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement
recognition. In April 2005, the SEC adopted a rule that delayed
the effective date of SFASNo123 revised 2004 to
the first annual reporting period beginning after June15,
2005. The Company is required to adopt SFASNo123
revised 2004 on January1, 2006. Based on the outstanding
stock options not vested as of December31, 2005, the
adoption of SFASNo123 revised 2004 is not
expected to have a material impact on the Companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations. In March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation
FIN No47, Accounting for Conditional
Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of
FASB Statement No143. FIN47 clarifies that
liabilities associated with asset-retirement obligations whose
timing or method of settlement is conditional upon future events
should be recorded at fair value as soon as fair value can be
reasonably estimated and provides guidance on whether fair value
is considered reasonably estimable. FIN47 is effective no
later than the end of fiscal years ending after
December15, 2005 December31, 2005 for calendar-year
companies. The adoption of the provisions of FIN47 did
not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
SFASNo154 establishes, unless impracticable,
retrospective application as the required method for reporting a
change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit
transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting
principle. The statement provides guidance for determining
whether retrospective application of a change in accounting
principle is impracticable. The statement also addresses the
reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously
issued financial statements. SFASNo154 is effective
for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal
years beginning after December15, 2005. The adoption of
SFASNo154 is not expected to have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial position or results
of operations. Special Items During 2005, the Company recorded a special pre-tax charge
totaling $325,000 in connection with a severance agreement for a
former executive. Substantially all costs related to this charge
were paid in 2005. During 2004, the Company recorded a special
pre-tax charge totaling $700,000 in connection with an
employment agreement for another former executive. Substantially
all costs related to this charge were paid in 2004. Floor Plan Arrangements The Company finances certain inventory purchases in its
Technology Solutions business unit through floor plan
arrangements with two finance companies. The amount of aggregate
outstanding floor plan obligations ranged between $68,000 and
$21million during 2005 and between $15million and
$51million during 2004, and were collateralized by
certain of the Companys inventory and accounts receivable.
The outstanding amounts are payable in 15 to 45days. The
arrangements are generally subsidized by computer products
manufacturers and are interest free if amounts are paid within
the specified terms. The Company paid minimal interest under
floor plan arrangements for the periods presented. Stock Repurchase Program In July 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a stock
repurchase program of up to 1,000,000shares of the
Companys outstanding common stock. The common stock can be
repurchased in the open market at varying prices depending on
market conditions and other factors. No shares were repurchased
by the Company during the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003. 30 Stock Plans The Company maintains certain stock option plans which provide
for the issuance of common stock to be available for purchase by
employees and by non-employee directors of the Company. Under
the stock option plans, both incentive and nonqualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock may be
granted. Options outstanding under the plans have terms of five
or ten years, vest over a period of up to four years and were
issued at market value on the date of grant. The following summarizes activity under the plans

At December31, 2004 and 2003, 455,500 and 861,562 options
were exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of $296
and $384, respectively. Under the Bell Industries Employees Stock Purchase Plan
the ESPP 750,000shares were authorized for
issuance to Bell employees. Eligible employees may purchase Bell
stock at 85% of market value through the ESPP at various
offering times during the year. During the third quarter of
2002, the Company suspended the ESPP. At December31, 2005,
419,450shares were available for future issuance under the
ESPP. The Black-Scholes model was utilized for estimating the fair
value of stock-based grants using an assumed volatility of
approximately 60% for all years presented and an expected four
year life for stock options. The assumed risk free interest rate
was approximately 40% for all years presented. 31 Income Taxes The income tax provision benefit charged creditedwas

After consideration of relevant factors, including recent
operating results and the prior utilization of all previously
available tax carryback opportunities, the Company recorded a
full valuation allowance against net deferred tax asset balances
in the fourth quarter of 2003. Based on continued operating
losses and other relevant factors, the Company recorded an
increase in the valuation allowance of approximately $278,000
and $16million during the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company reversed previously
recorded tax accruals in the amount of $13million that
were no longer required. These accruals existed for the
potential disallowance of transaction 32 costs in connection with the purchase of a business in 1997 and
for a goodwill deduction taken in connection with the sale of
the Companys Electronics Distribution Group in January
1999. The statute of limitations for these matters expired in
2003. As of December31, 2005, the Company has Federal net
operating loss carryforwards of $64million that expire in
years 2023 through 2025. The use of the net operating loss
carryforwards could be subject to certain statutory limitations
upon a change in control. Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans The Company has a qualified, trusteed, savings and profit
sharing plan for eligible employees. The Companys matching
contributions and discretionary contributions to the plan, as
determined by the Board of Directors, were $75,000 in 2005 87,000 in 2004 and $59,000 in 2003. The Company has deferred compensation plans available for
certain officers and other key employees. Expense associated
with the deferred compensation element of these plans was
$108,000 in 2005, $149,000 in 2004 and $207,000 in 2003. Retiree Medical Program The Company provides postretirement medical coverage for
qualifying employees who were employed prior to January1,
1998. The employee must meet age and years of service
requirements and must also be participating in a Bell medical
plan at the time of retirement to be eligible. Any future
increases in health premiums can be passed on 100% to retirees.
The estimated liability for postretirement medical benefits,
included in deferred compensation, environmental matters and
other long term liabilities, totaled $773,000 and $822,000 at
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Annual costs for
active and potentially eligible employees were not significant
during any of the years presented. Environmental Matters The reserve for environmental matters primarily relates to the
cost of monitoring and remediation efforts, which commenced in
1998, of a former leased facility site of Bells
electronics circuit board manufacturer ESD. The
ESD business was closed in the early 1990s. The project involves
a water table contamination clean up process, including
monitoring and extraction wells. The Company has fully
cooperated with the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board CRWQCB to proactively resolve and address
the remediation of the site. There are no administrative orders
or sanctions against the Company. The Company obtained a cost
cap insurance policy, expiring in November 2008, to cover
remediation costs. The policy is in the amount of
$40million. Before coverage under the policy commences,
the Company must spend $19million of its own funds. This
$19million is the self insured retention. In late 2003, the CRWQCB required testing for several
emergent chemicals, which are compounds that have
only recently been identified as potential groundwater
contaminants. During testing in 2004, one of these emergent
chemicals, 1-4 Dioxane, was found at the site. This
substance was used as a stabilizing agent in the solvents that
were used at the former ESD site. A detailed groundwater
investigation was performed in 2004 to determine the extent of
this contaminant and the plume in general. This investigation
revealed that the existing groundwater plume was significantly
larger than previously estimated. Additional remediation,
including the installation of three new groundwater extraction
wells, took place during 2005. In late 2005, total future
remediation and related costs were reassessed and are estimated
to be approximately $37million. At December31,
2005, approximately $16million estimated current
portion is included in accrued liabilities and
$21million estimated non-current portion is included in
deferred compensation, environmental matters and other in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December31, 2004, estimated
future remediation costs totaled approximately $33million
$10million current and $23million non-current. Payments under the cost cap insurance policy commenced during
2004 after the Company exceeded the $19million self
insured retention limit, and approximately $11million has
been collected as of December31, 2005 from the insurance
carrier. The estimated future amounts to be recovered from
insurance, during the policy period ending November 2008, total
$29million. At December31, 2005, approximately
$19million 33 estimated current portion is included in prepaid expenses and
other, and $10million estimated non-current portion is
included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At
December31, 2004, estimated future amounts to be recovered
from insurance totaled $26million $11million
current and $15million non-current. Given the nature of environmental remediation, it is possible
that the estimated liability for future remediation and related
costs and the estimated future amounts to be recovered from
insurance will be subject to revision from time to time. Litigation Williams Electronic Games litigation: In May 1997,
Williams Electronics Games, Inc. Williams filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern
District of Illinois US DistrictCourt
against a former Williams employee and several other defendants
alleging common law fraud and several other infractions related
to Williams purchase of electronic components at
purportedly inflated prices from various electronics
distributors under purported kickback arrangements during the
period from 1991 to 1996. In May 1998, Williams filed an amended
complaint adding several new defendants, including Milgray
Electronics, Inc., a publicly traded New York corporation
Milgray, which was acquired by Bell in a stock
purchase completed in January 1997. The complaint sought an
accounting and restitution representing alleged damages as a
result of the infractions. Bell has not been named in any
complaint and was not a party to the alleged infractions. Bell,
as the successor company to Milgray, has vigorously defended the
case on several grounds and continues to assert that Milgray did
not defraud Williams, and that Williams suffered no damages as
electronic components were purchased by Williams at prevailing
market prices. The case proceeded to trial, which commenced and ended in March
2002, with a jury verdict resulting in Milgray having no
liability to Williams. In July 2002, Williams appealed the jury
verdict and, in April 2004, the United States Court of Appeals
for the 7thCircuit US Appellate Court
rendered its decision. The US Appellate Court concluded that
jury instructions issued by the US District Court were in error
and the case was ordered for retrial of Williams fraud and
restitution claims. The case was remanded to the US District
Court and a new judge was assigned. In September 2005, the US
District Court entered its order declining to exercise
supplemental jurisdiction over Williams claims and
dismissing Williams case without prejudice. The US
District Court noted in its order that Williams could pursue its
claims in Illinois State Courts. In October 2005, Williams filed
a Notice of Appeal to the US Appellate Court from the judgment
of dismissal entered by the US District Court. Williams
claim for compensatory damages is approximately
$87million, not including an additional claim for
pre-judgment interest. While the Company cannot predict the
outcome of this litigation, a final judgment favorable to
Williams could have a material adverse effect on the
Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial
position. Management intends to continue a vigorous defense. Other litigation: The Company is involved in other
litigation, which is incidental to its current and discontinued
businesses. The resolution of the other litigation is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Commitments and Contingencies At December31, 2005, the Company had operating leases on
certain of its facilities and equipment expiring in various
years through 2011. Under certain operating leases, the Company
is required to pay property taxes and insurance. Rent expense
under operating leases was $22million during each of the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. At December31, 2005 the Company had capital leases related
to certain hardware and software in connection with a technology
solutions engagement that commenced in 2005. Depreciation
expense during 2005 relating to these leases totaling $347,000
is included in cost of products sold. 34 Minimum annual rentals on operating and capital leases for the

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management with the participation of the Companys
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as such term is defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act as of December31,
2005. Based upon this evaluation, and because of the material
weakness described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of December31, 2005. The
Companys management nevertheless has concluded that the
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report
on Form10-K
present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. As described at the note to Consolidated Financial Statements
under the heading titled Restatement, included at
PartI of this report, the Company has restated its 2004
and 2003 annual consolidated financial statements to correct an
error in the presentation of the Companys floor plan
arrangements. Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has concluded that as of December31, 2005, the
Company did not maintain effective controls over the
preparation, review, presentation and disclosure of amounts
included in our Consolidated 38 Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
Specifically, cash flows from the Companys floor plan
arrangements were not appropriately classified as cash flows
from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Further, these floor plan liabilities were not
properly segregated from accounts payable in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet as required under generally accepted accounting
principles. This control deficiency resulted in the restatement
of the Companys 2004 and 2003 annual consolidated
financial statements, the interim consolidated condensed
financial statements for all interim periods in 2004, the first
three interim periods in 2005 and audit adjustments to the
2005year-end financial statements. Additionally, this
control deficiency could result in a misstatement of the
Companys accounts that would result in a material
misstatement to the Companys presentation and disclosure
of floor plan arrangements that would not be prevented or
detected. Accordingly, management has concluded that this
control deficiency constitutes a material weakness. Remediation Plan Subsequent to December31, 2005, the Company has
implemented enhanced procedures which include improved training
and review processes to ensure proper preparation, review,
presentation, and disclosure of amounts included in its balance
sheet and statement of cash flows. Accordingly, management
believes it has improved the design and effectiveness of its
internal control over financial reporting; however, not all of
the newly designed controls have operated for a sufficient
period of time to demonstrate operating effectiveness.
Therefore, management will continue to monitor and assess these
control procedures to ascertain if the material weakness
discussed above has been remediated. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Companys internal control
over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended
December31, 2005 that has materially affected, or is
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting. Item9B.Other Information None. PARTIII
