See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 1.Basis of
Presentation and Accounting Policies   
Basis of Presentation Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the
consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto relate to
the continuing operations of Rockwell Automation, Inc. the
Company or Rockwell Automation. Certain prior year amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On June29, 2001, the Company completed the
spinoff of its Rockwell Collins avionics and communications
business and certain other assets and liabilities into an
independent, separately traded, publicly held company the
Spinoff. In connection with the Spinoff, all outstanding shares
of common stock of Rockwell Collins, Inc. Rockwell Collins
were distributed to Rockwell Automation shareowners on the basis
of one Rockwell Collins share for each outstanding Rockwell
Automation share. At the time of the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins
made a special payment to the Company of $300million. The
net assets of Rockwell Collins as of June29, 2001 of
approximately $12billion including $300million of
debt incurred to make the special payment to the Company were
recorded as a decrease to shareowners equity.   
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the
Company include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries
over which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated in consolidation.   
Use of Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and revenues and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items,
customer returns, rebates and incentives; allowance for doubtful
accounts; excess and obsolete inventory; impairment of
long-lived assets; product warranty obligations; retirement
benefits; self-insurance liabilities; litigation, claims and
contingencies, including environmental matters; and income taxes.   
Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the
following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product
delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been
rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is
reasonably assured. Contracts and customer purchase orders are
generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement.
Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are
used to verify delivery. The Company assesses whether the fee is
fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with
the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund
or adjustment. The Company assesses collectibility based
primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined
by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers
payment history. The Company records accruals for customer
returns, rebates and incentives at the time of shipment based
upon historical experience. Changes in such accruals may be
required if future returns, rebates and incentives differ from
historical experience. Rebates and incentives are recognized as
a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account
credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized as cost of sales
for products or services to be provided. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers
are included in sales and the related costs are included in cost
of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 34 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued   
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes time deposits
and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three
months or less.   
Receivables Receivables are stated net of allowances for
doubtful accounts of $28million at September30, 2003
and $45million at September30, 2002. The decrease in
the allowance balance primarily relates to the writeoff of a
$9million distributor receivable and $3million of
account collections for which an allowance had previously been
provided. The remainder of the decrease resulted from the
Companys regular review of the allowance, considering such
factors as historical experience, credit quality, and age of the
accounts receivable balances. In addition, receivables are
stated net of an allowance for certain customer rebates and
incentives of $5million at September30, 2003 and
$6million at September30, 2002.   
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using first-in, first-out FIFO or average methods.
Market is determined on the basis of estimated realizable values.   
Property Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of
property is provided generally using straight-line and
accelerated methods over 15 to 40years for buildings and
improvements and 3 to 14years for machinery and equipment.
Significant renewals and enhancements are capitalized and
replaced units are written off. Maintenance and repairs, as well
as renewals of minor amounts, are charged to expense.   
Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets generally
result from business acquisitions. The Company accounts for
business acquisitions by assigning the purchase price to
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Assets acquired
and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values, and
the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is
recorded as goodwill. Since October1, 2001 upon adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142,
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives are no longer systematically amortized but instead are
reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying value over
the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations.
Distributor networks, computer software products, patents, and
other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives,
generally ranging from 3 to 40years.   
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of the
carrying amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. If an
asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. Management determines fair value
using discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted
valuation techniques. 35 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued The Company performed its annual evaluation of
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment
during the second quarter of 2003 and concluded that no
impairments existed other than as a result of the sale of a
majority of the Companys ownership interest in Reliance
Electric Limited Japan REJ see Note17.   
Investments Investments in affiliates over which the Company
has the ability to exert significant influence but does not
control, including Rockwell Scientific Company LLC RSC, are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Companys proportional share of the
respective affiliates earnings or losses are included in
other income expensein the Consolidated Statement of
Operations. Investments in affiliates over which the Company
does not have the ability to exert significant influence are
accounted for using the cost method of accounting. These
affiliated companies are not material individually or in the
aggregate to Rockwell Automations financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.   
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments
in the form of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and
interest rate risks. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
are used to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows
associated with intercompany transactions generally forecasted
to occur within one year cash flow hedges and changes in the
fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from
intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties
denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swap contracts
are periodically used to manage the balance of fixed and
floating rate debt. The Companys accounting method for
derivative financial instruments is based upon the designation
of such instruments as hedges under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. It is the policy of the
Company to execute such instruments with creditworthy banks and
not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial
countries.   
Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating
outside of the United States with a functional currency other
than the U.S.dollar are translated into U.S.dollars
using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates
effective during the respective period. Foreign currency
translation adjustments are included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the results of operations in the
period incurred.   
Research and Development Expenses Research and development RD costs are
expensed as incurred and were $130million in 2003 131million in 2002 and $158million in 2001. RD
expenses are included in cost of sales in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations. Customer-funded RD was $61million in
2001 and related primarily to the Companys formerly
wholly-owned now 50percent owned subsidiary, Rockwell
Science Center. Customer-funded RD was not material in 2003
and 2002.   
Earnings Per Share The Company presents two earnings per share
EPSamounts, basic and diluted. Basic EPS is calculated
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS amounts are
based upon the weighted average number of common and common
equivalent 36 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
1.
Basis of Presentation and Accounting
PoliciesContinued shares outstanding during the year. The
difference between basic and diluted EPS is solely attributable
to stock options. The Company uses the treasury stock method to
calculate the effect of outstanding stock options. Stock options
for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price
over the period have an antidilutive effect on EPS, and
accordingly, are excluded from the calculation. There were no
shares excluded from the diluted EPS calculation for the year
ended September30, 2003. For the years ended
September30, 2002 and 2001, options for 40million
and 59million shares, respectively, were excluded from
the diluted EPS calculation because they were antidilutive.   
Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Stock options are granted at prices equal to the fair market
value of the Companys common stock on the grant dates;
therefore no compensation expense is recognized in connection
with stock options granted to employees. Compensation expense
resulting from grants of restricted stock is recognized during
the period in which the service is performed. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
share as if the fair value-based method provided by
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, had been applied for all outstanding and
unvested awards in each year

Environmental Matters The Company records accruals for environmental
matters in the period in which its responsibility is probable
and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Revisions to the
accruals are made in the periods in which the estimated costs of
remediation change. At environmental sites in which more than
one potentially responsible party has been identified, the
Company records a liability for its estimated allocable share of
costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an
estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of
insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in
which the Company is the only responsible party, the Company
records a liability for the total estimated costs of
remediation. Future expenditures for environmental remediation
obligations are not discounted to their present value. If
recovery from insurers or other third parties is determined to
be probable, the Company records a receivable for the estimated
recovery.   
Recently Adopted Accounting
Standards In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASBissued SFASNo146, Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
SFAS146, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting associated with exit or disposal activities. Under
SFAS146, the Company will measure costs associated with an
exit or disposal activity at fair value and recognize the costs
in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than at
the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The
Company adopted SFAS146 on January1, 2003. In November 2002, the FASB issued
FASBInterpretation No45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN45.
FIN45 provides guidance on the disclosures to be made by a
guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued and
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the
inception of certain guarantees, a liability for the fair value
of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
Company adopted FIN45 in 2003. In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on
Issue No00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables EITF00-21.
EITF00-21 establishes criteria to determine whether an
arrangement that contains multiple deliverables should be
divided into separate units of accounting and how the
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate
units. EITF00-21 was effective for arrangements entered
into after June30, 2003. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities FIN46. FIN46 requires a
company to consolidate any variable interest entities for which
the company has a controlling financial interest. FIN46
also requires disclosures about the variable interest entities
that the Company is not required to consolidate, but in which it
has a significant variable interest. The Company adopted the
consolidation requirements of FIN46 on February1,
2003. The adoption of SFAS146, FIN45,
EITF00-21 and FIN46 had no effect on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or
shareowners equity.   
2.
Acquisitions of Businesses In March 2003, the Companys Control Systems
segment acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities
of Weidmller Holding AGs Weidmller North
American business. In addition, the Company entered into a
master brand label agreement, a technology/design exchange and
joint product development efforts with Weidmller. The
acquisition enhances the Companys position in providing
IEC an international standard for electrical technologies
connection products which are used to connect factory automation
systems to basic electrical switches. 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
2.
Acquisitions of
BusinessesContinued In February 2003, the Companys Control
Systems segment acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Interwave Technology, Inc., a
consulting integrator focusing on manufacturing solutions. The
acquisition expands the Companys Manufacturing Information
Solutions capability and accelerates its ability to integrate
real-time information between customers manufacturing
plant floors and business systems. The aggregate cash purchase price of the
businesses acquired in 2003 was approximately $26million.
The Company would be required to make additional cash payments
if certain future operating performance criteria are met by the
acquired businesses. Management believes that these additional
cash payments, if any, would be recorded as goodwill and would
not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or shareowners equity.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at
estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the
estimated fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible
assets was recorded as goodwill. See Note3 for goodwill
and intangible assets acquired in connection with these
acquisitions. In September 2002, the Companys Control
Systems segment acquired the engineering services and system
integration assets of SPEL, spol. s.r.o. The acquisition
accelerated the establishment of the Company as a complete
solution provider in Central Europe and it also strategically
located the Company in a region with future growth opportunities. In May 2002, the Companys Control Systems
segment acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
the controller division of Samsung Electronics Company
Limiteds Mechatronics business the Controller Division.
The Company combined its existing Korean business with the
Controller Division to form a new business that operates under
the name Rockwell Samsung Automation and creates technologies
for the design and development of automation products. The
acquisition expanded the Companys existing operations in
Korea, furthered the Companys design and product
development capabilities and supported future commercial and
operational expansion in the Asia Pacific region. In March 2002, the Companys Control Systems
segment acquired all of the stock of Propack Data GmbH
Propack, a provider of manufacturing information systems for
the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries. The
acquisition broadened the Companys position in the
pharmaceuticals market, enhanced the Companys Process
Solutions business and enabled the Company to expand its reach
into the manufacturing information markets. In January 2002, the Companys Control
Systems segment acquired all of the stock of Tesch GmbH, an
electronic products and safety relay manufacturer, expanding the
Companys machine safety product and research and
development capabilities. The aggregate cash purchase price of the
businesses acquired in 2002, of which the majority related to
the acquisition of Propack, was approximately $71million.
In connection with the Controller Division transaction, the
Company would be required to make additional cash payments if
certain future operating performance criteria are met by the
acquired business. Management believes that these additional
cash payments, if any, would be recorded as goodwill and would
not have a material effect on the Companys financial
position, results of operations or shareowners equity.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at
fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets was

intangible assets acquired in connection with these acquisitions. Amounts recorded for liabilities assumed in
connection with these acquisitions were $1million in 2003
and $6million in 2002. These acquisitions were accounted for as
purchases and, accordingly, the results of operations of these
businesses have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Operations since their respective dates of 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Acquisitions of

allocation of the purchase price is not presented as the
combined effect of these acquisitions was not material to the
Companys results of operations or financial position. 3.Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets In connection with the adoption of SFAS142
in 2002, management determined that the Companys
Allen-Bradley, Reliance and Dodge trademarks have indefinite
useful lives. Accordingly, management performed a transitional
intangible asset impairment test which resulted in an impairment
charge of $56million $35million after tax, or
19cents per diluted share related to the Reliance
trademark used primarily by Power Systems. The impairment charge
represents the excess of the carrying amount of the trademark
over its estimated fair value as determined by management, with
the assistance of independent valuation experts, utilizing the
relief from royalty valuation method. This method estimates the
benefit to the Company resulting from owning rather than
licensing the trademark. Also in connection with the adoption of
SFAS142, the Company completed a transitional goodwill
impairment test during 2002. As a result, an impairment charge
of $73million before and after tax, or 39cents per
diluted share was recorded related to goodwill at a Power
Systems reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit was
estimated using a combination of valuation techniques, including
the present value of expected future cash flows and historical
valuations of comparable businesses. The previous method for determining impairment
prescribed by SFASNo121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed of, utilized an undiscounted cash flow approach for
the initial impairment assessment, while SFAS142 utilizes
a fair value approach. The trademark impairment charge and the
goodwill impairment charge discussed above are the result of the
change in the accounting method for determining the impairment
of goodwill and certain intangible assets. These charges have
been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in
the amount of $129million $108million after tax, or
58cents per diluted share as of October1, 2001 in
the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill

trademarks which have been determined to have an indefinite
life. The change in the carrying amount of unamortized
intangible assets for the year ended September30, 2003
relates to an impairment resulting from the sale of a majority
of the Companys ownership interest in REJ see
Note17. Estimated amortization expense is
$26million in 2004, $22million in 2005 19million in 2006, $19million in 2007 and
$18million in 2008. In connection with the acquisitions in 2003 see
Note2, the Company acquired $4million of intangible
assets, of which $3million was assigned to distributor
networks. The weighted-average amortization period for the
intangible assets acquired in 2003 is approximately 5years. In connection with the acquisitions in 2002 see
Note2, the Company acquired $12million of
intangible assets, of which $9million was assigned to
computer software products. The weighted-average amortization
period for the intangible assets acquired in 2002 is
approximately 5years and the amortization period for

portion of long-term debt at September30, 2002 was
$150million principal amount of 680% notes which were
retired at maturity in April 2003. The weighted average interest
rate on short-term bank borrowings was 28percent at
September30, 2002. At September30, 2003, the Company had
$675million of unsecured committed credit facilities
available to support its commercial paper borrowings, with
$3375million expiring in October 2003 and
$3375million expiring in October 2005. During October
2003, the Company entered into a new $3375million credit
facility expiring in October 2004. Outstanding commercial paper
balances, if any, reduce the amount of available borrowings
under the unsecured committed credit facilities. The terms of
the credit facilities contain a covenant under which the Company
would be in default if the Companys debt to capital ratio
were to exceed 60percent. In addition to the
$675million credit facilities, short-term unsecured credit
facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to
$121million at September30, 2003. There were no
significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements
under any of the Companys credit facilities. 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Long-Term Debt
Continued In September 2002, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap contract the Swap which effectively
converted its $350million aggregate principal amount of
615% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on
six-month LIBOR. The floating rate was 352percent at
September30, 2003 and 421percent at
September30, 2002. The fair value of the Swap, based upon
quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities, was
approximately $10million at September30, 2003 and
$6million at September30, 2002. As permitted by SFAS
No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 133 as amended, the Company has
designated the Swap as a fair value hedge. Accordingly, the fair
value of the Swap was recorded in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet and the carrying value of the
underlying debt was increased to $360million at
September30, 2003 and $356million at
September30, 2002 in accordance with SFAS 133. Interest payments were $55million during
2003, $63million during 2002 and $79million during
2001. Interest payments related to discontinued operations for
2001 were not significant.   
10.
Financial Instruments The Companys financial instruments include
short- and long-term debt, foreign currency forward exchange
contracts and an interest rate swap. It is the policy of the
Company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes. The fair value of short-term debt
approximates the carrying value due to its short-term nature.
The carrying value of long-term debt was $773million at
September30, 2003 and $919million at
September30, 2002. The fair value of long-term debt, based
upon quoted market prices for the same or similar issues, was
$844million at September30, 2003 and
$976million at September30, 2002. Foreign currency forward exchange contracts
provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at
specified future dates at specified exchange rates. At
September30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding
foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting
of contracts for the euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar and
Swiss franc. The net carrying value of foreign currency forward
exchange contracts of $42million at September30,
2003 and $15million at September30, 2002 represented
the approximate fair value based upon quoted market prices for
contracts with similar maturities. The foreign currency forward
exchange contracts are recorded in other current assets in the
amounts of $5million as of September30, 2003 and
$6million as of September30, 2002 and other current
liabilities in the amounts of $47 million as of
September30, 2003 and $21million as of
September30, 2002. The Company does not anticipate any
material adverse effect on its results of operations or
financial position relating to these foreign currency forward
exchange contracts. The Company has designated certain foreign
currency forward exchange contracts related to forecasted
intercompany transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount
recognized in earnings as a result of the ineffectiveness of
cash flow hedges was not material.

or common stock of the acquirer for $250. In certain
circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for
one share of common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior

Unrealized gains on cash flow hedges of $7million

earnings and offset losses on the hedged items. Approximately
$28million $18million after tax of the net
unrealized losses on cash flow hedges as of September30,

expects that these unrealized losses will be offset when the
hedged items are recognized in earnings. 46 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock Options Options to purchase common stock of the Company
have been granted under various incentive plans and by board
action to directors, officers and other key employees at prices
equal to the fair market value of the stock on the dates the
options were granted. The plans provide that the option price
for certain options granted under the plans may be paid in cash,
shares of common stock or a combination thereof. Under the 2000 Long-Term Incentives Plan, the
Company may grant up to 16million shares of Company common
stock as non-qualified options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights and restricted stock. Shares available for
future grant or payment under various incentive plans were
approximately 54million at September30, 2003. None
of the employee incentive plans presently permits options to be
granted after November30, 2009. Stock options generally
expire ten years from the date they are granted and vest over
three years time-vesting options with the exception of
performance-vesting options. Performance-vesting options expire
ten years from the date they are granted and vest at the earlier

Retirement Benefits The Company sponsors pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for its employees. The pension
plans cover most of the Companys employees and provide for
monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement.
Pension benefits for salaried employees generally are based on
years of credited service and average earnings. Pension benefits
for hourly employees are primarily based on specified benefit
amounts and years of service. The Companys policy with
respect to funding its pension obligation is to fund the minimum
amount required by applicable laws and governmental regulations.
The Company may, at its discretion, fund amounts in excess of
the minimum amount required by laws and regulations. Other
postretirement benefits are primarily in the form of retirement
medical plans and cover most of the Companys United States
employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs
of eligible employees and dependents upon retirement. In connection with the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins
assumed the former Rockwell International Corporation domestic
qualified pension plan Rockwell Retirement Plan. Pension plan
obligations attributable to all of Rockwell Automations
domestic active employees and former employees of the Control
Systems, Power Systems and FirstPoint Contact businesses were
retained by Rockwell Automation and a proportionate share of
pension plan assets were transferred from the former Rockwell
International Corporation domestic qualified plan Rockwell
Retirement Plan to a new pension plan established by Rockwell
Automation. The Company also retained liabilities for other
postretirement benefits for active and former employees. The
tables below reflect the continuing Rockwell Automation plans. 48 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During 2003, the Company recorded an increase to
its minimum pension liability of $280million resulting
primarily from unfavorable actual returns on plan assets
relative to the expected return on plan assets and a decline in
the discount rates used to calculate benefit obligations. After
recognition of a deferred tax asset of $108million, the
net reduction to shareowners equity resulting from this
adjustment was $170million. In June 2003, the Company made a $50million
voluntary contribution to the Companys primary U.S.
qualified pension plan trust compared to a 2002 contribution of
$24million which was related to the spinoff of Rockwell
Collins. The Company uses an actuarial measurement date of
June30 to measure its benefit obligations for pension and
other postretirement benefits.

As a result of the plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, as more fully described below,
and in accordance with SFAS No106, Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefit Other Than Pensions,
the Companys postretirement healthcare liabilities were
recalculated as of the date of the amendment using a
65percent discount rate, the discount rate applicable at
the date of the plan amendment. The Companys related net

The healthcare cost trend rate reflects the
estimated increase in gross medical claims costs as required to
be disclosed by SFAS No132, Employers
Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement
Benefits. The gross healthcare cost trend rate will decrease
to 55% in 2009. As a result of the plan amendment adopted
effective October1, 2002, as more fully described below,
the effective retiree medical cost increase to the Company will
approach zero percent in 2005.
Effective October1, 2002, the Company
amended its United States postretirement healthcare benefit
program in order to mitigate the increasing cost of
postretirement healthcare services. This change will be phased
in as follows: effective January1, 2004, the Company, per
an amendment to this program implemented in 1992, will
contribute 50percent of the amount in excess of the 2003
per capita amount. However, the Companys calendar 2004
contribution shall be limited to a 75percent increase
from the 2003 per capita amount. Effective January1, 2005,
the Company will limit its future per capita maximum
contribution to its calendar 2004 per capita contribution.

plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair
value of plan assets underfunded plans were $1,734 million 1,486million and $1,063million, respectively, as of
the 2003 measurement date June30 and
$1,325million, $1,137million and $961million,
respectively, as of the 2002 measurement date.   
Defined Contribution Savings Plans The Company also sponsors certain defined
contribution savings plans for eligible employees. Expense
related to these plans was $25million for 2003, 2002 and
2001.

Special Charges In 2001, the Company recorded special charges of
$91million $60million after tax, or 32cents
per diluted share for costs associated with the consolidation
and closing of facilities, the realignment of administrative
functions, the reduction of workforce, primarily in North
America, by approximately 2,000 employees and asset impairments.
The Company had completed these actions at September30,
2002. Total cash expenditures in connection with these
actions will approximate $50million, and primarily relate
to employee severance and separation costs. Substantially all
had been spent as of September30, 2003. In connection with
the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins assumed a liability for employee
severance and separation costs resulting from these actions of
approximately $7million. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 14.Special
ChargesContinued The special charges included write-downs to the
carrying amount of goodwill, certain facilities and machinery
and equipment totaling approximately $27million resulting
from the decision to shut down certain facilities and exit
non-strategic operations. The charges represented the difference
between the fair values of the assets and their carrying values.
Fair value was determined by management on the basis of various
customary valuation techniques. The special charges are reflected in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
September30, 2001 in cost of sales in the amount of
$50million and selling, general and administrative
expenses in the amount of $41million.   
15.
Discontinued Operations The benefit of $7million $4million
after tax in discontinued operations in 2003 reflects income
from a favorable determination in a legal proceeding related to
the Companys former operation of the Rocky Flats facility
of the Department of Energy. The net benefit of $3million in
discontinued operations in 2002 reflects the resolution of
certain obligations related to two discontinued businesses.
Related payments of approximately $36million were made in
2002, which have been reflected as cash used by discontinued
operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows. Summarized results of the Companys Rockwell

Transactions The Company owns 50percent of RSC. This
ownership interest is accounted for using the equity method. The
Companys investment in RSC of $54million at
September30, 2003 and $50million at
September30, 2002 is included in other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company has an agreement with RSC pursuant to
which RSC performs research and development services for the
Company through 2004. The Company is obligated to pay RSC a
minimum of $3million for such services in 2004. The
Company incurred approximately $3million for research and
development services performed by RSC in 2003 and 2002. At
September30, 2003 and 2002, the amounts due to RSC for
research and development services and from RSC for cost sharing
arrangements were not significant. The Company shares equally with Rockwell Collins,
which owns 50percent of RSC, in providing a
$4million line of credit to RSC which bears interest at
the greater of the Companys or Rockwell Collins
commercial paper borrowing rate. At September30, 2003 and
2002, there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of
credit. In addition, the Company and Rockwell Collins each
guarantees one-half of a lease agreement for one of RSCs
facilities. The total future minimum lease payments under the
lease are approximately $6 million. The lease agreement has a
term which ends in December 2011. The Company owns 25percent of CoLinx, LLC
CoLinx, a company that provides logistics and e-commerce
services. This ownership interest is accounted for using the
equity method. The Company paid CoLinx approximately
$15million in 2003 and 2002, and $6million in 2001,
primarily for logistics services. In addition, CoLinx paid the
Company approximately $2million in 2003, $3million
in 2002, and $2million in 52 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

During 2003, the Company sold a majority of its
ownership interest in REJ resulting in a loss of approximately
$8million $3million after tax, or 1cent per
diluted share. The loss includes a $9million non-cash
charge related to the impairment of the Reliance trademark. The
after-tax loss on the sale includes a $2million benefit
resulting from the Companys ability to utilize capital
loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been
previously provided. The proceeds of the transaction totaled

through 2001. The federal portion of the Claim is subject to the
approval of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the United States
Congress and the related state tax benefits are subject to
approval by the various state tax authorities. The majority of
the proceeds from the Claim are expected to be received, or
netted against any liability arising 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

TaxesContinued from the audit, upon the conclusion of the
current federal audit cycle which is expected in 2005. The
future annual income tax benefit related to research and
experimentation expenditures is not expected to be significant. During 2002, the Company resolved certain tax
matters for the period of 1995-1999. The resolution resulted in
a $48million reduction of the Companys income tax
provision, of which $11million is reflected in tax refund
claims in the current income tax provision and $37million
is reflected in the United States deferred income tax provision. During 2001, the Company reached agreement with
various taxing authorities on refund claims related to certain
prior years and recorded $22million as a reduction of its
income tax provision. Net current deferred income tax assets at

factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets
include: athe historical operating results of the

In the second quarter of 2003, a tax benefit of
approximately $2million was recognized as a result of the
Companys ability to utilize certain capital loss
carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been
previously provided. The ability to utilize the capital loss
carryforwards was the result of the sale of a majority of the
Companys ownership interest in REJ which took place in the
second quarter of 2003. The $48million reduction of the 2002 income
tax provision resulting from the resolution of certain tax

No provision has been made for United States,
state, or additional non-United States income taxes related to
approximately $200million of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be
permanently reinvested. In 2003, the Company adjusted its
currency translation and deferred income taxes by approximately
$25million resulting from a decision made by the Company
to permanently reinvest the earnings of certain of its foreign
subsidiaries. It is not practical to determine the United States
federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if
such earnings were not permanently reinvested. Income taxes paid were $85million during
2003, $37million during 2002 and $213million during
2001. Income taxes paid related to discontinued operations for
2001 were not significant. 19.Commitments
and Contingent Liabilities Environmental
Matters Federal, state and local requirements relating to
the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal
of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the
environment have and will continue to have an effect on the
manufacturing operations of the Company. Thus far, compliance
with environmental requirements and resolution of environmental
claims has been accomplished without material effect on the
Companys liquidity and capital resources, competitive
position or financial condition. The Company has been designated as a potentially
responsible party at 14Superfund sites, excluding sites as
to which the Companys records disclose no involvement or
as to which the Companys potential liability has been
finally determined and assumed by third parties. Management
estimates the total reasonably possible costs the Company could
incur for the remediation of Superfund sites at
September30, 2003 to be about $17million, of which
$7million has been accrued. Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings
have been asserted against the Company alleging violations of
federal, state and local environmental protection requirements,
or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments,
principally at previously owned properties. As of
September30, 2003, management has estimated the total
reasonably possible costs the Company could incur from these
matters to be about $52million. The Company has recorded
environmental accruals for these matters of $21million. In
addition to the above matters, the Company assumed certain other
environmental liabilities in connection with the 1995
acquisition of Reliance. The Company is indemnified by
ExxonMobil Corporation Exxon for substantially all costs
associated with these Reliance matters. At September30,
2003, the Company has recorded a liability of approximately
$26million and a receivable of approximately
$25million for these Reliance matters. Management
estimates the total reasonably possible costs for these matters
to be approximately $37 million for which the Company is
substantially indemnified by Exxon. Based on its assessment, management believes that
the Companys expenditures for environmental capital
investment and remediation necessary to comply with present
regulations governing environmental protection and other
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not
have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity
and capital resources, competitive position or financial
condition. Management cannot assess the possible effect of
compliance with future requirements. 56 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued   
19.
Commitments and Contingent
LiabilitiesContinued   
Purchase Commitments In connection with the sale of a Power Systems
business in 2000, the Company entered into a supply agreement
with the buyer of the business. The agreement requires minimum
purchases by the Company of approximately $21million per
year through December31, 2005 at prices which management
believes are higher than those available from other vendors. In
the event that purchases are less than $21million in a
given year, the Company may incur penalties which are
25percent of the amount by which the actual purchases were
less than the contractual minimum for the period. Penalties paid
by the Company under the terms of the supply agreement were
approximately $2million in 2003 and approximately
$1million in 2002. The liability recorded in connection
with the supply agreement was approximately $3million at
September30, 2003 and approximately $6million at
September30, 2002. See Note16 for a discussion on the
Companys commitments to related parties.   
Lease Commitments Minimum future rental commitments under operating
leases having noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year
aggregated $214million as of September30, 2003 and
are payable as follows in millions: 2004, $48; 2005, $38;
2006, $29; 2007, $25; 2008, $17; and after 2008, $57.
Commitments from third parties under sublease agreements having
noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year aggregated
$22million as of September30, 2003 and are
receivable through 2009 at approximately $4million per
year. Most leases contain renewal options for varying periods,
and certain leases include options to purchase the leased
property during or at the end of the lease term. Rental expense was $83million in 2003 84million in 2002, and $86 million in 2001.   
Other Matters Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have
been or may be instituted or asserted against the Company
relating to the conduct of its business, including those
pertaining to product liability, intellectual property, safety
and health, employment and contract matters. In connection with
the divestiture of its former aerospace and defense businesses
the AD Business to The Boeing Company Boeing, Rockwell
Automation agreed to indemnify Boeing for certain matters
related to operations of the AD Business for periods prior
to the divestiture. In connection with the spinoffs of the
Companys former automotive component systems business,
semiconductor systems business and Rockwell Collins avionics and
communications business, the spun-off companies have agreed to
indemnify Rockwell Automation for substantially all contingent
liabilities related to the respective businesses, including
environmental and intellectual property matters. Although the
outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and
some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of
unfavorably to the Company, management believes the disposition
of matters which are pending or asserted will not have a
material adverse effect on the Companys business or
financial condition. The Company has, from time to time, divested
certain of its businesses. In connection with such divestitures,
there may be lawsuits, claims and proceedings instituted or
asserted against the Company related to the period that the
businesses were owned by the Company. In addition, the Company
has guaranteed performance and payment under certain contracts
of divested businesses, including a $60million lease
obligation of the Companys former semiconductor systems
business, now Conexant Systems, Inc. Conexant. The lease
obligation of Conexant is secured by real property subject to
the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the
real property. In consideration for this guarantee, the Company
receives $250,000 per quarter from Conexant through
December31, 2003. The guarantee expires in 2005.
Management believes that any judgments against the Company
related to such matters or claims pursuant to the guarantees
would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business or financial condition. 57 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Other represents the sales and segment operating
earnings of Rockwell Science Center through the third quarter of
2001. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the
Companys 50percent ownership interest in RSC is
accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys
proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included
in general corporate net. Effective October1, 2001, the Company
adopted SFAS142. As a result of adopting SFAS142,
the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and certain other
intangible assets that have been deemed to have an indefinite
useful life. The amortization of goodwill and the intangible
assets that have been deemed to have an indefinite useful life
was $56million in 2001. Among other considerations, the Company evaluates
performance and allocates resources based upon segment operating
earnings before income taxes, interest expense, costs related to
corporate offices, nonrecurring special charges, gains and
losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses
from equity affiliates which are not considered part of the
operations of a particular segment and incremental acquisition
related expenses resulting from purchase accounting adjustments
such as goodwill and other intangible asset amortization,
depreciation, inventory and purchased research and development
charges. Intersegment sales are made at market prices. The
accounting policies used in preparing the segment information
are consistent with those described in Note1. Special
charges are discussed in Note14. 59 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

62 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Board of Directors and Shareowners of Rockwell Automation, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries as
of September30, 2003 and 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareowners equity,
cash flows, and comprehensive income for each of the three years
in the period ended September30, 2003. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
a2. These financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Rockwell Automation, Inc. and subsidiaries
at September30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September30, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forth therein. As described in Note3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, on October1, 2001, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin November5, 2003 63

Item 5.
Controls and Procedures. The Company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness, as of
September30, 2003, of the design and operation of the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rule13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are
effective as of the end of the year ended September30,
2003 to timely alert them to material information relating to
the Company including its consolidated subsidiaries required
to be included in the Companys Exchange Act filings. There have been no changes in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal
quarter ended September30, 2003 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting. PARTIII
