OF OPERATION.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001
REVENUES. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $42,863,000
compared to $31,982,000 for the same period in 2001, an increase of $10,881,000
or 34%. Of this increase, $8,958,000 is attributable to Vita Specialty Foods and
is largely due to the inclusion of a full twelve months of sales from the
Virginia Honey operation in the 2002 results plus two months of sales from the
newly acquired Halifax business, this compared to sales for only six months from
Virginia Honey during 2001. The $1,923,000 balance of the sales increase was
attributable to Vita and represents a 7% increase over the previous year. This
increase in sales of the Vita product line was a result of a 2% increase for
herring products, a 16% increase for salmon products, a 12% decrease for other
specialty products with sales returns remaining substantially constant compared
to the prior year. Management believes these increases are consistent with
nationwide increases                    10 in demand for similar products. Management is making changes to the packaging
and product line offerings in the other specialty product category in an effort
to turnaround the decreasing sales trend. Vita herring, salmon, and specialty
product sales represented 49%, 46%, and 5% of the business unit total gross
sales, respectively. Vita Specialty Foods' salad dressings/sauces, honey
products and specialty items represented 59%, 37% and 4% of the business unit
total gross sales, respectively.
GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $13,332,000
compared to $10,001,000 for the same period in 2001, an increase of $3,331,000
or 333%. Vita Specialty Food accounted for $2,544,000 of this increase with the
remaining $787,000 attributable to Vita. The large increase for Vita Specialty
Foods is a result of including the operations of Virginia Honey for a full
twelve months during 2002 plus two months results from the newly acquired
Halifax operation, compared to the inclusion of only six months of Virginia
Honey business during 2001. As a percentage of net sales, Vita Specialty Foods'
gross margin was 308% in 2002 verses 345% in 2001, a decrease of 37%. This
decrease is due to significantly higher raw honey cost in 2002 compared to 2001,
resulting in lower gross margins, with an impact to gross margin estimated at a
reduction of approximately $540,000. Vita gross margin was 313% in 2002
versus 306% in 2001, an increase of 07%. This increase in the gross margin
percentage was once again, as in 2001, primarily attributable to a combination
of decreased costs for raw fish, a sales mix shift toward higher margin products
and processing volume efficiencies.
OPERATING EXPENSES. Selling, marketing, distribution and administrative expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $10,417,000 compared to $7,902,000 for
2001, an increase of $2,515,000 or 318%. As a percentage of net sales, these
expenses decreased slightly to 243% from 247% for the same period in 2001. Due
to the full year inclusion of Virginia Honey and the two months inclusion of
Halifax, Vita Specialty Foods accounted for $2,214,000 of the increase. The
remaining $301,000 was attributable to Vita, representing a 46% increase. Of
this increase in Vita expenses, $90,000 was attributable to selling and
marketing where higher broker commissions and salesperson compensation along
with higher advertising and promotion expenses were partially offset by lower
spending in most other categories; the remaining $211,000 of the increase
reflects higher administrative spending, primarily for employment related
expenses of $82,000 and professional fees of $108,000.
INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE. Interest and other expense, net, for the year ended
December 31, 2002 was $602,000 compared to $562,000 for the same period in 2001,
an increase of $40,000 or 71%. This increase was primarily attributable to the
additional borrowings as detailed in Note 3 of the Company financial
statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K; this increase was partially
offset by lower effective interest rates.
INCOME TAXES. The net operating loss carryforward, which had been used in prior
years to offset federal income tax, was fully utilized during 2001.
Consequently, a tax expense for the year ending December 31, 2002 of $867,000 or
38% of pretax income was recognized, compared to $382,000 or 25% of pretax
income during 2001. The majority of this tax liability in 2002 was current and
in 2001 was deferred.
NET INCOME. As a result of the operating results discussed above, net income for
the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1,446,000 or $039 per share compared to
net income of $1,156,000 or $031 per share for the same period in 2001, a 251%
increase totaling $290,000 or $008 per undiluted share. Net income represented
$038 per share in 2002 on a diluted per share basis, an increase of $007 per
share over the 2001 results.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000
REVENUES. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $31,982,000
compared to $25,127,000 for the same period in 2000, an increase of $6,855,000
or 27%. Of this increase, $5,809,000 is attributable to Vita Specialty Foods,
representing the net sales of this business unit since the July 1, 2001
effective acquisition date. The balance of the sales increase, or $1,046,000 was
attributable to Vita and represents a 4% increase over the previous year. This
increase in sales of the Vita product line was a result of a 2% increase for
herring products, a 4% increase for salmon products, a 2% increase for other
specialty products and a 15% reduction in sales returns compared to prior year.
Management believes these increases are consistent with nationwide increases in
demand for similar products. Vita herring, salmon, and specialty product sales
represented 51%, 42%, and 7% of the business unit total gross sales,
respectively. Vita                    11
Specialty Food salad dressings, honey products and specialty items represented
53%, 46% and 1% of the business unit total gross sales, respectively.
GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $10,001,000
compared to $7,198,000 for the same period in 2000, an increase of $2,803,000 or
389%. Vita Specialty Food accounted for $2,003,000 of this increase with the
remaining $800,000 attributable to Vita. Vita gross margin was 306% in 2001
versus 286% in 2000, an increase of 20%. This increase in the gross margin
percentage was attributable to a combination of decreased costs for raw fish, a
sales mix shift toward higher margin products and successful programs resulting
in a reduction in the costs associated with product returns. As a percentage of
net sales, Vita Specialty Food gross margin was 345%.
OPERATING EXPENSES. Selling, marketing, distribution and administrative expenses
for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $7,902,000 compared to $6,094,000 for
the same period in 2000, an increase of $1,808,000 or 297%. As a percentage of
net sales, these expenses increased slightly to 247% from 243% for the same
period in 2000. Vita Specialty Food accounted for $1,304,000 of the increase
with the remaining $504,000 attributable to Vita and representing a 83%
increase for this unit. Of this increase in Vita expenses, $170,000 was
attributable to selling, marketing and distribution where higher freight costs
and market slotting expenses were partially offset by lower spending in most
other categories; the remaining $334,000 of the increase reflects higher
administrative spending, primarily for employment related expenses of $160,000;
professional fees of $116,000 and directors' and officers' expenses of $40,000.
INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE. Interest and other expense, net, for the year ended
December 31, 2001 was $562,000 compared to $402,000 for the same period in 2000,
an increase of $160,000 or 398%. This increase was primarily attributable to
the additional borrowings for the Virginia Honey Co. acquisition as detailed in
Note 3 of the Company financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form
10-K; this increase was partially offset by lower effective interest rates.
INCOME TAXES. The net operating loss carryforward, which has been used in prior
years' to totally offset federal income tax, became fully exhausted during 2001.
Consequently a tax expense for the year ending December 31, 2001 of $382,000 was
recognized. The majority of this tax liability is deferred. In 2000 the company
used a portion of the net operating loss carry forward to offset income taxes,
which would otherwise have been recognized as an expense and recognized $20,000
as a tax benefit in anticipation of the usage of the net operating loss
carryforward during 2001.
NET INCOME. As a result of the operating results discussed above, net income for
the year ended December 31, 2001 was $1,156,000 or $031 per share compared to
net income of $722,000 or $019 per share for the same period in 2000, a 601%
increase totaling $434,000 or $012 per share, for both basic and diluted per
share amounts.

4 Includes the results of Virginia Honey since the effective acquisition date
of July 1, 2001. The inclusion of this acquisition accounted for $80,000 of
the 2001 quarter three net income increase compared to that quarter in the
previous year, for $267,000 of the 2001 quarter four net income increase
compared to that quarter in the previous year, for $206,000 of the 2002
quarter one net income increase compared to that quarter in the previous
year and $173,000 of the 2002 quarter two net income increase compared to
that quarter of the previous year. The remaining increase is attributable
to Vita or as discussed in note 5 below.
5 Includes the results of Halifax since the effective date of November 1,
2002.   The Company has in the past and expects in the future to experience
significant fluctuation in quarterly operating results. As the tables indicate,
historically the Company net sales and net income have typically been the
highest in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company business is seasonal
because its sales volume increases significantly during the Christmas holiday
season and, to a lesser extent, during other holidays in the fall and spring and
periods of colder weather in certain sections of the country. Certain of these
holidays, including Passover, Easter, Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah, may fall in
different quarters in different years and could cause the Company quarterly
operating results to fluctuate in the future. However, the Company believes that
through the Vita Specialty Food acquisitions and the introduction of new
non-seasonal or counter-seasonal products, it can, over time, reduce the
variability in its quarterly operating results by increasing sales during the
second and third quarters of each year.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At December 31, 2002, the Company had $6,489,000 in working capital, compared to
$1,665,000 at December 31, 2001, an increase of $4,824,000 or 290%. As a result,
the current ratio improved to 21 to 10 from 12 to 10. Of this increase 3,767,000 is attributed to a reduction in the current portion of debt. This
reduction occurred primarily as a result of the Company and its bank entering
into a new agreement to amend and restate the Loan and Security Agreement
originally dated August 15, 2001. This change in the Company loan agreement
advanced the termination date for the revolving line of credit beyond the
current period by extending the term from July 31, 2002 until July 31, 2004.
When compared to the prior year, the working capital was further increased by
$1,057,000 primarily due to the $644,000 of working capital associated with
newly acquired Halifax.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had $46,000 in cash, an available revolving
credit facility of $8,500,000 and term facilities totaling $7,855,000. The
revolving loan facility matures July 31, 2004 and the term loans are payable in
monthly installments of $98,375 through November 30, 2005, $40,042 from December
1                    13 2005 through July 31, 2006 and balloon payments of $258,333 due on November 11,
2005 and $2,443,000 on July 31, 2006. Amounts outstanding under the revolving
facility and the term facilities at December 31, 2002 were $5,359,000 and
$6,406,000, respectively. The interest rates fluctuate based on the Funded Debt
to Adjusted EBITDA ratio as each such term is defined in the loan agreement. The
loan agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. At
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants.
The Stock Purchase Agreement, including its Amendments, for Virginia Honey
provides for future payments to the former owner based upon 20% of five times
the average quarterly EBITDA less certain debt obligations of Virginia Honey,
for the period from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002. The present value
of this calculation resulted in $764,765, and has been recorded as a liability
at December 31, 2002. The payment is due to be paid on April 1, 2005. The
remaining payments under the Stock Purchase Agreement to the former owner of
Virginia Honey and the payments per the merger agreement to the former owner of
Halifax will be based on the earnings of Vita Specialty Foods, reflecting the
combined earnings of Halifax and Virginia Honey. There are two periods of
measurement remaining, the first covers January 1, 2003 until December 31, 2005
and the second covers January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007. See Note 11 under
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on the
earnout payments.
The aggregate amount of long-term debt maturing by year is presented in the
table below.
During 2002, the Company incurred rental expense of approximately $377,000,
primarily due to operating leases for the facilities in Martinsburg, West
Virginia and equipment at the herring and salmon product processing facility in
Chicago, Illinois. As part of the Halifax acquisition, the Company has entered
into a lease agreement with the former owner of the Atlanta facilities, which
involves a commitment of $119,000 in 2003 and $21,000 before expiration in 2004.
Future commitments under all operating leases are presented in the table below.
Also during 2002, in connection with the Halifax acquisition, the Company
acquired the licensing rights to various brand names. In connection with these
rights the Company has assumed the commitment to make minimum royalty payments
under the terms of these licensing agreements. These agreements fully expire in
2004 and the commitments are presented in the table below.                                    PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD

-  The ratio of long-term debt-to-total capitalization was 71% at December 31, 2002
compared to 62% at the prior year-end. The Company believes its financial
resources are adequate to fund its needs for the next twelve months.
CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. Net cash provided by operating activities
was $1,857,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $3,565,000 for
the year ended December 31, 2001 and a net use of $437,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2000. This positive cash flow for the most recent year is primarily
a result of $2,248,000 provided by net income plus depreciation and $383,000
provided from reduced                    14 accounts receivable less $654,000 of cash used to build inventory net of the
associated increase in accounts payable.
The $1,857,000 of cash flow provided through operations for the year ending
December 31, 2002 is $1,708,000 less than the $3,565,000 provided for the year
ending December 31, 2001. This is largely due to the fact that the cash flow
made available in the year ending December 2001, due to the reduction of
inventory net of associated accounts payable, totaled $1,430,000, thus resulting
in a $2,084,000 variance when compared to the net $654,000 of cash used in this
category for the most recent year. This negative variance was partially offset
since the cash flow provided by net income plus depreciation in 2002 exceeded
the prior year total by $462,000 and the cash flow provided by the reduction of
accounts receivable exceeded the prior year total by $258,000.
The $3,565,000 of positive cash flow for the year ending December 31, 2001,
represents a $4,002,000 improvement in cash flow when compared with the year
ended December 31, 2000. This was primarily a result of $683,000 of higher net
income and depreciation and the $3,017,000 improvement resulting from the
$1,433,000 of cash provided from accounts receivable and inventory net of
accounts payable and accruals when compared to the $1,584,000 of cash used to
increase these net asset categories during the year ended December 31, 2000.
CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used in investing activities was
$1,490,000, $5,458,000 and $607,000 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 respectively. During the most recent year, this cash was used primarily
for capital additions of $1,245,000 and the acquisition of Halifax, net of cash
acquired, totaling $244,000. During the year ended December 31, 2001, $4,641,000
was paid for Virginia Honey, net of cash acquired and $721,000 was invested in
capital additions. The $593,000 of capital expenditures made during the year
ended December 31, 2000, accounts for the majority of that year investing
activities.
CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. Net cash used by financing activities was
$851,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to cash sources of
$2,408,000 and $1,006,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, and December
31, 2000 respectively. The most recent year activity includes $117,000 of cash
provided from stock and stock option purchases less $928,000 for the net pay
down of outstanding debt. There was a net pay down of debt during 2002
primarily, as discussed above, due to the cash provided from operations
exceeding the net investing activities. It was necessary for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000 to increase the bank debt since the cash provided
through operations was insufficient to cover the investing activities, most
notably the 2002 acquisition of Virginia Honey.
INFLATION
Inflation has historically not had a material effect on the Company
operations.
IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 145, Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections. This Statement rescinds SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishment of Debt and an amendment of that Statement, SFAS No. 64,
Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements. This
Statement also rescinds SFAS No. 44, Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor
Carriers. This Statement amends SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, to
eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback
transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that
have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. This
Statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make
various technical corrections, clarify meanings or describe their applicability
under changed conditions. The provisions of this Statement are effective for
financial statements on or after May 15, 2002. Management does not believe that
the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on the Company
financial statements.
In July 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit of Disposal Activities SFAS 146. This Statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 94-3                    15 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs
to Exit and Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in Restructuring. This
Statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when
the liability is incurred. The provisions of this Statement are effective for
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.
Management does not believe that the adoption of this Statement will have a
material impact on the Company financial statements.
In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. This Statement amends the transition
and disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation. For most companies, the impact of Statement 148 is
more frequent and prominent disclosure of stock-based compensation expense
beginning with financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15,
2002. Statement 148 amends existing disclosures that a company should make in
its annual financial statements and requires for the first time, disclosure in
interim financial reports.
In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Indebtedness of Others was issued. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be
made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that
a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this
Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. The required disclosures and a roll-forward of
product warranty liabilities are effective for financial statements of interim
or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. At this time the Company does
not believe that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect
on its financial statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The Company financial statements reflect the selection and application of
accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and
assumptions. The Company believes that the following are some of the more
critical judgment area in the application of its accounting policies that
currently affect the Company financial condition and results of operations.
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities.
On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those
related to revenues, returns, bad debts, income taxes and contingencies and
litigation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to customers in fulfillment
of customer orders. In accordance with industry practices, inventory is sold to
customers often with the right to return or dispose if the merchandise is not
sold prior to the expiration of its shelf life. In order to support the
Company products, various marketing programs are offered to customers which
reimburse them for a portion or all or their promotional activities related to
the Company products. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when it deems
necessary, estimates of costs to the Company for these marketing and
merchandising programs based on estimates of what has been incurred by
customers. Actual costs incurred by the Company may differ significantly if
factors such as the level and success of the customers' programs or other
conditions differ from expectations. Sales are reduced by a provision for
estimated future returns, disposals and promotional expenses.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and
financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities based upon currently
enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or
settled.                    16   In 2002, SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets became
effective and as a result, the Company assesses the impairment of identifiable
intangibles, and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company
considers important, which could trigger an impairment review include the
following   o  Significant underperformance relative to expected historical or
projected future operating results;
o  Significant changes in the manner of the Company use of the acquired
assets or the strategy for the Company overall business;
o  Significant negative industry or economic trends;
o  Significant decline in the Company stock price for a sustained
period; and
o  The Company market capitalization relative to net book value.
When the Company determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived
assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of
one or more of the above indicators of impairment, the Company will review for
impairment under the provisions of SFAS 142.
The provisions of SFAS 142 also required the completion of transitional
impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived assets within 12 months of
adoption, with any impairment treated as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle. During the second quarter of 2002, the Company completed
the transitional impairment test, which did not result in impairment of recorded
goodwill.
During the fourth quarter, the Company completed its annual impairment test,
which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
The Company has a revolving line of credit with a bank, which bears
interest at the prime rate minus 035% 390% at December 31, 2002 or LIBOR
plus 240% 382% at December 31, 2002. This rate adjustment remains constant
from July 31, 2002, the date of the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated
Loan and Security Agreement, until April 1, 2003. Commencing on April 1, 2003
the interest rate is based upon certain financial covenants and may range from
prime minus 010% to prime minus 060% or LIBOR plus 265% to LIBOR plus 215%.
In addition, the Company has two term loan facilities, which bear interest at
the prime rate minus 005% 420% at December 31, 2002 or LIBOR plus 275%
loan 1 - 415% and loan 2 - 416% at December 31, 2002 until April 1, 2003.
Commencing on April 1,2003 the interest rate is based on certain financial
covenants, which may range from prime plus 020% to prime minus 030% or LIBOR
plus 310% to LIBOR plus 245%. A 10% fluctuation in interest rates would not
have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This annual report on Form 10-K, including Description of Business,
Description of Property, Legal Proceedings and Management Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based
on management current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. Such factors and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to: i the impact of the level of the Company
indebtedness; ii restrictive covenants contained in the Company various debt
documents; iii general economic conditions and conditions in the retail
environment; iv the Company dependence on a few large customers; v price
fluctuations in the raw materials used by the Company, particularly herring and
salmon; vi competitive conditions in the Company markets; vii the seasonal
nature of the Company business; viii the Company ability to execute its
acquisition strategy; ix fluctuations in the stock market; x the extent to
which the Company is able to retain and attract key personnel; xi
relationships with retailers; xii relationships with key vendors; xiii
consolidation of the Company supplier base; xiv successful integration of
Virginia Honey and Halifax and xv the impact of federal, state and local
environmental requirements including the impact of current or future
environmental claims against the Company. As a result, the Company operating
results may fluctuate, especially when measured on a quarterly basis.
The Company business strategy contemplates that the Company will pursue
potential acquisitions. The Company currently has no agreements or
understandings with respect to any acquisitions and there can                    17
be no assurance that the Company will be successful in pursuing other potential
acquisitions. However, the costs associated with this strategy, means of
financing any potential acquisitions, and consummation and integration of any
potential acquisitions could significantly impact the Company financial and
operating performance. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

To the Board of Directors of
Vita Food Products, Inc.
Chicago, Illinois
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vita Food
Products, Inc. and Subsidiary, as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. We have also audited
the schedule listed in the accompanying index. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
schedule are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and schedule. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and schedule. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Vita Food Products,
Inc. and Subsidiary, at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.
Also in our opinion, the schedule presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.                               BDO Seidman, LLP Chicago, Illinois

VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies utilized in the preparation
of the accompanying financial statements follows.
INDUSTRY
The Company processes and sells various herring, and cured and smoked salmon
products and other complementary specialty food products throughout the
United States. The Vita Specialty Foods subsidiary manufactures and
distributes salad dressings, gourmet sauces, honey, jams and jellies. The
Company considers the products and related operations of Vita Specialty
Foods as a separate business segment.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Vita Food
Products, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Vita Specialty Foods. Vita
Specialty Foods includes Virginia Honey commencing on July 1, 2001, the
effective date of this acquisition and Halifax, commencing on November 1,
2002, the effective date of this acquisition. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts
receivable. The Company primarily provides credit in the normal course of
business. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and maintains allowances for potential credit losses, if necessary.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product to customers in fulfillment
of customer orders.
MERCHANDISE RETURNS
In accordance with industry practices, inventory is sold to customers often
with the right to return or dispose if the merchandise is not sold prior to
the expiration of its shelf life. Sales are reduced by a provision for
estimated future returns and disposals.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms.
The Company sells products to distributors and retailers throughout the food
industry. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition.
Senior management reviews accounts receivable on a regular basis to
determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectable. The Company
provides an allowance sufficient to cover any accounts receivable balances
that are potentially uncollectable, along with a general risk factor. After
attempts to collect the receivable have failed and it is considered to be
uncollectable it is written off against the allowance. Based on the
information available, the Company believes the allowance for doubtful
accounts as of December 31, 2002 to be adequate and not excessive. However,
it is still possible that in the future, actual write offs may exceed the
recorded balance.

VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs are determined
by the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and
amortization are being provided, on straight-line methods, over the
estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the respective leases
or the service lives of the improvements whichever is shorter. Amortization
of assets under capital lease is included in depreciation and amortization.
Repair and maintenance items are expensed as incurred.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived and identifiable
intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable. Any long-lived assets held for disposal are reported at the
lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less cost to sell. As of
December 31, 2002 there has been no impairment of long-lived assets.
GOODWILL
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142 Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142, which addresses the financial accounting
and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent
to their acquisition. This accounting standard requires that goodwill no
longer be amortized, and instead be tested for impairment on a periodic
basis.
The provision of SFAS 142 requires the completion of a transitional
impairment test within 12 months of adoption, with any impairment treated as
a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. During the second
quarter of 2002, the Company completed the transitional impairment test,
which did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill. During the fourth
quarter, the Company completed its annual impairment test, which did not
result in impairment of recorded goodwill.
The Company acquisition of Virginia Honey was accounted for under SFAS
141, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the Company did not have goodwill
amortization expense in 2001 relating to this acquisition.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December
31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows   Balance as of January 1, 2001            $    0
Goodwill acquired during the year          5,238,895
Balance as of December 31, 2001           5,238,895
Goodwill acquired during the year          1,562,161
Additional purchase price payable related to
Virginia Honey acquisition            764,765
Balance as of December 31, 2002           $7,565,821
ESTIMATES
The accompanying financial statements include estimated amounts and
disclosures based on management assumptions about future events. Actual
results may differ from those estimates.

VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   ADVERTISING
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling and
marketing expenses and distribution expenses. Advertising expenses amounted
to approximately $370,000, $343,000 and $347,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES
The Company classifies shipping and handling costs billed to customers as
revenue. Costs related to shipping are classified as part of selling,
marketing and distribution.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis and
financial reporting basis of certain assets and liabilities based upon
currently enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are
realized or settled.
BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share follows the computation of basic earnings per
share and gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were
outstanding during the year.
The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings per share to diluted
earnings per share for each of the last three years                             Weighted

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED CONSIDERATION
The Company applies the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its 1996 Stock Option Plan, 1996
Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and 1996 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, as the market price of the stock did not exceed the exercise
price of the options on the measurement date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   The Company has elected to continue to utilize the accounting provisions of
APB 25 for stock options, and is required to provide proforma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share had the Company adopted the fair value
method under SFAS No. 123. The weighted-average, grant date fair value of
stock options granted to employees during the year and the weighted-average

In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 145, Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and
Technical Corrections. This Statement rescinds SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains
and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt and an amendment of that Statement,
SFAS No. 64, Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund
Requirements. This Statement also rescinds SFAS No. 44, Accounting for
Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers. This Statement amends SFAS No. 13,
Accounting for Leases, to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for
certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback transactions. This Statement also amends other existing
authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify
meanings or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The
provisions of this Statement are effective for financial statements on or
after May 15, 2002. Management does not believe that the adoption of this
Statement will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In July 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit of Disposal Activities SFAS 146. This Statement addresses
financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue
No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other Costs to Exit and Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in
Restructuring. This Statement requires that a liability for costs
associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured
initially at fair value only
26               VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   when the liability is incurred. The provisions of this Statement are
effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December
31, 2002. Management does not believe that the adoption of this Statement
will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.
In December 2002, FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation - Transition and Disclosure. This Statement amends the
transition and disclosure requirements of FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. For most companies, the impact of
Statement 148 is more frequent and prominent disclosure of stock-based
compensation expense beginning with financial statements for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. Statement 148 amends existing disclosures
that a company should make in its annual financial statements and requires
for the first time, disclosure in interim financial reports.
In November 2002, FASB Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45, Guarantor
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Indebtedness of Others was issued. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to
be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also
clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement
provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The required
disclosures and a roll-forward of product warranty liabilities are effective
for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December
15, 2002. At this time the Company does not believe that the adoption of
this interpretation will have a material effect on its financial statements.

a The Company entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement
the Loan with a bank on November 6, 2002 which consisted of an
$8,500,000 revolving loan facility and two term loan facilities totaling
$7,855,000. Borrowings under the revolving loan are limited to 80% of
eligible receivables and 60% of eligible inventory, as such terms are
defined in the Loan. The revolving loan facility matures July 31, 2004. The
term loans are payable in monthly installments totaling $98,375 through
November 30, 2005, $40,042 from December 1, 2005 through July 31, 2006, and
balloon payments of $258,333 on November 11, 2005 and $2,443,000 on July 31,
2006. The loans are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company.
Interest under the Loan is payable monthly. The interest rates fluctuate
based on the Funded Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio, as each such term is
defined in the Loan. The revolving loan facility bears interest at rates
ranging from LIBOR plus 265% to LIBOR plus 215%, or prime minus 010% to
prime minus 060%. Similarly, the term loan facility bears interest ranging
from LIBOR plus 310% to LIBOR plus 245%, or prime plus 020% to prime
minus 030%. At December 31, 2002, a portion of the revolving loan facility
bore interest at the prime rate 425% minus 035% and another portion at
LIBOR 142% plus 240%. At that date, the term loan facilities had a
portion bearing interest at the prime rate 425% minus 005% and the
remainder split into two loans with one bearing interest at a LIBOR rate of
140% plus 275% and the second with a LIBOR rate of 141% plus 275%.
The Loan imposes certain restrictions upon the Company including capital
expenditures and payment of dividends, and requires the Company to maintain
certain financial covenants and ratios, including Tangible Net Worth and
EBITDA to Total Debt Service, as each such term is defined in the Loan. At
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with
these covenants.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b As part of the acquisition agreement for Virginia Honey the Company assumed
a 70% note payable to a former Virginia Honey shareholder. At December 31,
2002 the balance due was $2,814,131. This note is payable in monthly
installments through 2018.
c The Stock Purchase Agreement, including its Amendments, for Virginia Honey
provides for future payments to the former owner based upon 20% of five
times the average quarterly EBITDA less certain debt obligations of Virginia
Honey, for the period from January 2001 through December 31, 2002. The
present value of this calculation resulted in $764,765, and has been
recorded as a liability at December 31, 2002. The payment is due to be paid
on April 1, 2005. The remaining payments under the Stock Purchase Agreement
to the former owner of Virginia Honey and the payments per the merger
agreement to the former owner of Halifax will be based on the earnings of
Vita Specialty Foods, the combined earnings of Halifax and Virginia Honey.
There are two periods of measurement remaining, the first covers January 1,
2003 until December 31, 2005 and the second covers January 1, 2006 until
December 31, 2007. See Note 11 under Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for a further discussion on the earnout payments.
d The merger agreement with Halifax provides that, as part of the acquisition
price, the balance of a note due to the former owner by the acquired
organization will be repaid to that individual by the Company on April 1,
2006. No interest accrues on this debt. See Note 11 below for further
discussion of this merger agreement. Scheduled annual maturities of long-term obligations as of December 31, 2002 are

5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A. In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into purchase
commitments for raw materials and does not anticipate any losses. The
Company purchases a majority of its herring from one supplier. The Company
former agreement with the supplier provided that the supplier had an option
to supply up to 90% of the Company annual requirements for herring,
provided that the supplier agrees to supply the herring at competitive
prices. The agreement was terminated in 2002, however, the Company continues
to purchase from the supplier at competitive prices and has other supply
sources should the supplier prices cease to be competitive.
B. In the ordinary course of business, the Company becomes involved in
litigation as a defendant in various lawsuits. In the opinion of management,
after considering the advice of counsel, the ultimate resolution of these
legal proceedings will not have a material effect on the financial
statements taken as a whole and thus no provision has been made in the
financial statements for any loss contingencies.
C. The Company leases its Virginia Honey warehouses from a former owner of
Virginia Honey, who is now an officer of Vita Specialty Foods, under two
leases that expire in 2003. The Company has the right to renew the leases
for four successive five-year terms. Future payments under these leases
amount to approximately $290,000 for the year ending 2003. Since July 1,
2001, the effective date of the acquisition, rent expense under these
agreements totaled $153,000 and $306,000 in 2001 and 2002, respectively.
D. The Company leases its Halifax warehouses from a former owner of Halifax,
who is now an officer of Vita Specialty Foods, under two leases, one that
expires at the end of 2003 while the other expires in the first quarter of
2004. Future payments under these leases amount to approximately $119,000
and $21,000 for the years ending 2003 and 2004, respectively. The Company is
seeking to consolidate the operations of Halifax with Virginia Honey
operations and believes these leases will not be renewed.
6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company has established a qualified, 401k, profit sharing plan
covering its non-union employees. Participants may elect to defer a portion
of annual compensation. The Company may contribute amounts at the discretion
of the board of directors.
The Company expensed 401k matching contributions of $59,000, $29,000 and
$14,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
31               VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   Additionally, the Company participates in two multi-employer plans that
provide benefits to the Company union employees. Contributions to the
plans for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $31,000,
$31,000 and $34,000, respectively.
7. MAJOR CUSTOMER
In the year ending December 31, 2002, the Company had sales to one customer
representing 19% and sales to another customer representing 12% of total
annual net sales. At December 31, 2002, these customers had open accounts
receivable balances of $1,016,000 and $634,000 respectively. At December 31,
2001 the Company had sales to one customer representing 12% of total annual
net sales; this customer had an open accounts receivable balance of
$712,000. In 2000, the Company had sales to a different customer
representing 10% of total annual net sales, and at December 31, 2000, that
customer had an open accounts receivable balance of $335,000.
8. CAPITAL
On September 11, 1996, the Company adopted the Vita Food Products, Inc. 1996
Stock Option Plan pursuant to which 325,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options designated as either an

Products, Inc. 1996 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The plan
was amended and restated in 2000 to provide for 175,000 shares of common
stock to be reserved for issuance upon the exercise of options designated as
a nonqualified stock option. These options become fully vested six months
after issuance and may be granted to directors who are not employees of the

9. EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS
The Company has employment agreements with two officers of the Company,
extending through December 2003. Under the terms of these agreements, the
officers are entitled to be paid a salary of $240,030 annually adjusted
annually for increases of at least the cost of living index, plus bonuses,
if any, and certain perquisites.
The Company entered into an employment agreement with an officer of Virginia
Honey in conjunction with the purchase of Virginia Honey. The agreement
extends to December 31, 2004 and calls for the officer to receive a salary
of $300,000 per year with, at the sole discretion of Virginia Honey board
of directors, a maximum raise equal to the percentage increase in the cost
of living index. In addition, the Company entered into an employment
agreement with an officer of Halifax in conjunction with the purchase of
Halifax. The agreement extends to December 31, 2007 and calls for the
officer to receive a salary of $242,500 per year with a 3% per year increase
starting January 1, 2004.
10. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
short-term debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. The fair value of the Company notes payable, and
capital lease obligations is based on rates currently available for debt
with similar terms and maturities from the bank issuing the Loan discussed
in Note 3.
11. ACQUISITIONS
THE VIRGINIA HONEY COMPANY, INC.
Effective July 1, 2001 Vita acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Virginia Honey from Terry W. Hess. The results of Virginia
Honey have been included in the Company consolidated financial statements
since the effective date. Virginia Honey is a manufacturer and distributor
of honey, salad dressings, sauces, jams and jellies and gift baskets. As a
result of the acquisition, the Company is leveraging its sales and
distribution network to provide national exposure to the products of
Virginia Honey. The Company also expects to introduce products that will be
jointly developed, thereby increasing the market presence of Vita and
Virginia Honey.
33               VITA FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The aggregate purchase price, including direct costs of the acquisition, of
$4,884,437 was paid in cash. The Stock Purchase Agreement, including its
Amendments, for Virginia Honey provides for future payments to the former
owner based upon 20% of five times the average quarterly EBITDA less certain
debt obligations of Virginia Honey, for the period from January 2001 through
December 31, 2002. The present value of this calculation resulted in
$764,765, and has been recorded as a liability at December 31, 2002 and, as
discussed in Note 3 above, is payable on April 1, 2005. The remaining
payments under the Stock Purchase Agreement to the former owner of Virginia
Honey and the payments per the merger agreement to the former owner of
Halifax will be based on the earnings of Vita Specialty Foods, the combined
earnings of Halifax and Virginia Honey. There are two periods of measurement
remaining, the first covers January 1, 2003 until December 31, 2005 and the
second covers January 1, 2006 until December 31, 2007.
As a result of the Halifax merger agreement discussed below, the operations
of Virginia Honey and Halifax have been merged effective November 1, 2002.
Accordingly, EBITDA applicable to the future contingent payments due to Mr.
Hess will be determined based upon a formula included as part of that merger
agreement. Should Virginia Honey maintain its current profitability levels,
the Company estimates that total remaining payments, with a net present
value of approximately $11 million, would be due and payable as contingent
consideration in accordance with the provisions of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
THE HALIFAX GROUP, INC.
Effective November 1, 2002, Vita Food Products, Inc. acquired all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Halifax, a Georgia
corporation, from Robert J. Budd and certain affiliates or associates of Mr.
Budd. Since the effective date, the results of Halifax have been fully
integrated with the results of Virginia Honey. This merger of Halifax and
Virginia Honey has resulted in a new subsidiary named Vita Specialty Foods.
Halifax is a manufacturer and distributor of licensed brand-named sauces,
marinades, salad dressings, various gourmet products and branded gift items,
many of which are similar to those of Virginia Honey. The Company expects to
enjoy both market synergies and production efficiencies as a result of this
merger.
On the November 6, 2002 closing date, as a direct cost of the acquisition,
the Company paid cash of $450,000 to Mr. Budd in partial payment of the
$795,781 preexisting debt owed to him by Halifax. The discounted value of
the remaining debt has been recorded by the Company as a long-term
obligation as discussed in Note 3 above. The Company also assigned to Mr.
Budd any potential rights or exposure associated with an unresolved legal
case involving Halifax, the actual dollar amount of which is indeterminable
at this time. The merger agreement further provides for two future
contingent payments to Mr. Budd. The first will be based upon 45% of five
times the Halifax portion of Vita Specialty Food average quarterly EBITDA.
The agreement includes a formula that allocates EBITDA between Halifax and
Virginia Honey, based on the proportion of each unit products sold.
This EBITDA will be averaged quarterly for calendar years 2003 through 2005.
This first contingent payment will be reduced by the remaining balance of
the preexisting debt discussed above. The second contingent payment will be
determined the same way except the percent will be reduced from 45% to 30%
and will be based upon the calendar years 2006 and 2007. If payable, the
first payment will be paid on or before April 1, 2006 and the second will be
paid on or before April 1, 2008 and both will be recorded as additional
acquisition costs. Should Vita Specialty Foods maintain its current
profitability levels, the Company estimates that the total remaining
payments, with a net present value of approximately $700,000, would be due
and payable as contingent consideration in accordance with the provisions of
the merger agreement. The following table summarizes the fair values of the
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition                  AT NOVEMBER 1, 2002
