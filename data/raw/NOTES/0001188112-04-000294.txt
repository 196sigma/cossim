THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS
TRACTOR SUPPLY COMPANY
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tractor Supply
Company as of December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 27, 2003. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tractor Supply
Company at December 27, 2003 and December 28, 2002, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 27, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in fiscal 2003 the Company
changed its method of accounting for certain consideration received from
vendors.

28          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the
United States. The Company is focused on supplying the lifestyle needs of
recreational farmers and ranchers and serving the maintenance needs of those who
enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses. Stores are
located in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
The Company operated 463 retail farm and ranch stores in 30 states as of
December 27, 2003.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year includes 52 or 53 weeks and ends on the last Saturday
of the calendar year. References to fiscal year mean the year in which that
fiscal year began. Each of the fiscal years ended December 27, 2003, December
28, 2002 and December 29, 2001 contain 52 weeks.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States inherently
requires estimates and assumptions by management that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related
disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates and assumptions by management primarily impact the
following key financial statement areas   INVENTORY VALUATION
The Company identifies potentially excess and slow-moving inventory by
evaluating turn rates and overall inventory levels. Excess quantities are
identified through the application of benchmark turn targets and historical
sales experience. Further, exposure to inadequate realization of carrying
value is identified through analysis of gross margin achievement and
markdown experience, in combination with all merchandising initiatives. The
estimated reserve is based on management current knowledge with respect
to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience relating to the
sale of the excess and/or slow-moving inventory. Management does not
believe the Company merchandise inventories are subject to significant
risk of obsolescence in the near-term, and management has the ability to
adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general
economic conditions. However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could
result in the need for additional reserves.
The Company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventory between physical
inventory counts by assessing the chain-wide average shrinkage experience
rate, applied to the related periods' sales volumes. Such assessments are
updated on a regular basis for the most recent individual store
experiences.
The Company receives funding from its vendors for promotion of the
Company brand as well as the sale of their products. Vendor funding is
accounted for as a discount on the purchase price of inventories and is
recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold. The amount of expected
funding is estimated based upon initial guaranteed commitments, as well as
anticipated purchase levels with applicable vendors. The estimated purchase
volume is based on management current knowledge with respect to inventory
levels, sales trends and expected customer demand, as well as
29          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
planned new store openings. Although management believes it has the ability
to reasonably estimate its purchase volume, it is possible that actual
results could significantly differ from the estimated amounts.
SALES RETURNS
The Company generally honors customer refunds within 30 days of the
original purchase, with the supporting receipt. The Company estimates its
reserve for likely customer returns based on the average refund experience
in relation to sales for the related period. Due to the seasonality of the
Company sales, the refund experience can vary, depending on the fiscal
quarter of measurement.
SELF-INSURANCE
The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers'
compensation, medical and general liability claims. However, the Company
has stop-loss limits and umbrella insurance coverage for certain risk
exposures subject to specified limits. Self-insurance claims filed and
claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management
estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using
actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical
experience. Although management believes it has the ability to adequately
record estimated losses related to claims, it is possible that actual
results could significantly differ from recorded self-insurance
liabilities.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue when sales transactions occur and customers take
possession of the merchandise. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns
is provided in the period during which the related sales are recorded.
STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS
Non-capital expenditures incurred in connection with start-up activities are
expensed as incurred.
STORE CLOSING COSTS
Beginning in fiscal 2003, the Company recognizes store closing costs in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities, which requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit
or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Prior to the
adoption of SFAS 146, the Company recognized store-closing costs primarily
remaining lease obligations and disposals of property and equipment at the time
the plan for the related store closing or relocation was finalized. The adoption
of SFAS 146 did not materially impact the Company financial position, cash
flows, or results of operations.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments, with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The majority of payments
due from banks for customer credit card transactions process within 24-48 hours
and are accordingly classified as cash and cash equivalents.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term trade receivables and payables and long-term debt instruments,
including capital leases. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
trade receivables and trade payables equal current fair value. The terms of the
Company revolving credit agreement the Credit Agreement and term loan
agreement include variable interest rates, which approximate current market
rates.
30          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS
Nos. 133, 137, and 138 collectively SFAS 133 pertaining to the accounting
for derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires the Company to
recognize all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value. SFAS
133 impacted the accounting for the Company interest rate swap agreement,
which was designated as a cash flow hedge.
INVENTORIES
The value of the Company inventories was determined using the lower of
last-in, first-out LIFO cost or market. Inventories are not in excess of
market value. Quarterly inventory determinations under LIFO are based on
assumptions as to projected inventory levels at the end of the fiscal year,
sales for the year and the rate of inflation/deflation for the year. If the
first-in, first-out FIFO method of accounting for inventory had been used,
inventories would have been approximately $5,267,000 higher than reported at
December 28, 2002. At December 27, 2003 LIFO and FIFO inventory values were the
same.
FREIGHT COSTS
The Company incurs various types of transportation and delivery costs in
connection with inventory purchases and distribution. Such costs are included as
a component of the overall cost of merchandise.
WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS
Costs incurred at the Company distribution centers for receiving, warehousing
and preparing product for delivery are expensed as incurred. These costs are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying
statements of income.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Improvements
to leased premises are amortized using the straight-line method over the life of
the lease or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter. The
following estimated useful lives are generally applied                              Life
Buildings              30 - 35 years
Leasehold improvements        5 - 15 years
Furniture, fixtures and equipment   5 - 10 years
Computer software           3 - 5 years IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is
recognized on assets classified as held and used when the sum of undiscounted
estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less
than the carrying value. Impairment on long-lived assets to be disposed of is
recognized by writing down the related assets to their fair value less costs to
sell, as appropriate, when the criteria have been met for the asset to be
classified as held for sale or disposal Note 3.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs consist of expenses incurred in connection with newspaper
circulars, television and radio, as well as direct mail, newspaper
advertisements and other promotions. Gross advertising expenses for fiscal 2003,
2002 and 2001 were approximately $38,235,000, $33,761,000 and $24,539,000,
respectively.
31          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, whereby
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
As permitted by SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company
has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plans under the
intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25 APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under APB No. 25, compensation expense would be recorded if the current market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeded the exercise price.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plans been determined based
on the fair value at the grant date derived through use of Black-Scholes
methodology for awards under the plans consistent with the method prescribed by
SFAS 123, the Company pro forma net income and net income per share for fiscal
2003, 2002 and 2001 would have been as follows in thousands, except per share

basic EPS is calculated as income available to common stockholders divided by
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS
is calculated using the treasury stock method for options and warrants. All

RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to
conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation.
NOTE 2 - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16 EITF 02-16 provides guidance for
the accounting treatment and income statement classification for consideration
given by a vendor to a retailer in connection with the sale of the vendor
products or for the promotion of sales of the vendor products. The EITF
concluded that such consideration received from vendors should be reflected as a
decrease in prices paid for inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the
related inventories are sold, unless specific criteria are met qualifying the
consideration for treatment as reimbursement of specific, identifiable
incremental costs. Prior to adopting this pronouncement, the Company classified
all vendor-provided marketing support funds as a reduction in selling, general
and administrative expenses.
The effect of applying the consensus of EITF 02-16 on prior-period financial
statements would have resulted in a change to previously reported net income.
Thus, the Company has reported the adoption of EITF 02-16 as a cumulative effect
adjustment in accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes and SFAS
No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements and as
permitted by EITF 02-16. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company
recognized a charge against net income of $3,053,000 $1,888,000 net of income
taxes, that resulted from the cumulative effect on prior years.
NOTE 3 - ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Assets held for sale consists of certain buildings and properties that the
Company either acquired through the significant asset purchase as described in
Note 16 or that the Company vacated upon relocation of a store.
The Company applies the provisions of SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment
of Disposal of Long Lived Assets, to assets held for sale. SFAS 144 requires
assets held for sale to be valued on an asset-by-asset basis at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. In applying these provisions,
recent appraisals, valuations, offers and bids are considered. The Company
recorded an impairment charge of $423,000 and $558,000 in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, to adjust the carrying value of certain property and equipment
related to vacated stores to fair value, less costs to sell. This charge is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, in
December 2002, the Company decided to retain an asset previously classified as
an asset held for sale as the Company believes the geographic location of the
property is favorable. The asset approximately $17 million was reclassified
from assets held for sale to property and equipment.
The buildings and properties held for sale are separately presented as assets
held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The assets are
classified as current, as the Company believes they will be sold within the next
twelve months and have met all the criteria for classification as held for sale
pursuant to SFAS 144.
NOTE 4 - CREDIT AGREEMENT In November 2000, the Company entered into a three-year unsecured senior

were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory.
NOTE 5 - OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT In June 1998, the Company entered into a new loan agreement the Loan
Agreement and term note the Term Note pursuant to which the Company
borrowed $15 million. There are no compensating balance requirements associated
with the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is unsecured.
In August 2002, in connection with the replacement of the Credit Agreement, the
Company amended the Loan Agreement and Term Note. The terms of the Loan
Agreement and Term Note were amended to provide that the existing indebtedness
would bear interest under the same provisions as that in the Credit Agreement
and the restrictive covenants would be modified to be the same as those in the
Credit Agreement Note 4. The maturity dates of the Loan Agreement and Term
Note were not amended and the Loan Agreement and the Term note matured in
November 2003.
Under the Loan Agreement and Term Note, the Company had $55 million outstanding
at December 28, 2002.
NOTE 6 - LEASES The Company leases the majority of its office space and most of its retail store
locations, transportation equipment and other equipment under various
noncancelable operating leases. The leases have varying terms and expire at
various dates through 2029 and 2018 for capital leases and operating leases,
respectively. The store leases typically have initial terms of between 10 and 15
years, with one to three renewal periods of five years each, exercisable at the
Company option. Generally, most of the leases require the Company to pay
taxes, insurance and maintenance costs.
Total rent expense for fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 was approximately
$60,129,000, $51,952,000, and $36,733,000, respectively.

NOTE 7 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS During fiscal 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement as
a means of managing its interest rate exposure. This agreement, which matured in
November 2003, had the effect of converting certain of the Company variable
rate obligations to fixed rate obligations.
The Company complies with SFAS 133 and recognized the fair value of the interest
rate swap in its consolidated balance sheet. The Company regularly adjusted the
carrying value of the interest rate swap to reflect its current fair value. The
related gain or loss on the swap was deferred in stockholders' equity as a
component of comprehensive income to the extent that the swap was an effective
hedge. The deferred gain or loss was recognized in income in the period in which
the related interest rate payments being hedged were recognized as an expense.
However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate swap
contract did not perfectly offset the change in the interest rate payments being
hedged, the ineffective portion was immediately recognized as an expense. Net
amounts paid or received were reflected as adjustments to interest expense.

ASSOCIATE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
The Company provides an Associate Stock Purchase Plan the ASPP whereby
eligible employees of the Company have the opportunity to purchase, through
payroll deductions, shares of common stock of the Company at a 15% discount.
Pursuant to the terms of the ASPP, the Company issued 52,900, 71,374 and 138,860
shares of common stock in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
NOTE 15 - GAIN ON PROCEEDS FROM LIFE INSURANCE In April 2001, a former executive of the Company, on whom the Company carried a
life insurance policy, passed away. As a result of the related coverage, the
Company realized a $22 million gain on the life insurance proceeds.
NOTE 16 - SIGNIFICANT ASSET PURCHASE On December 31, 2001, the Company, through a joint venture with Great American
Group, Gordon Brothers Retail Partners, LLC and DJM Asset Management LLC, was
the successful bidder at a liquidation bankruptcy auction for the buildings,
improvements, fixtures and lease rights of certain retail stores formerly
operated by Quality Stores, Inc., a debtor and debtor in possession under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Company share of the bid
totaled $340 million and was funded entirely through the Credit Agreement. The
Company acquired the buildings for 24 retail stores, assumed the building lease
rights for 76 additional retail stores and acquired the related equipment,
furniture and fixtures in the transaction.
The Company intends to sell three excess buildings acquired in the purchase and
is actively marketing these locations. The assigned value for these three
locations is included as assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet at December 27, 2003 Note 3.
NOTE 17 - CONTINGENCIES LITIGATION
The Company is involved in various litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business. After consultation with legal counsel, management expects these
matters will be resolved without material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations. Any estimated loss has
been adequately provided in accrued liabilities to the extent probable and
reasonably estimable. It is possible, however, that future results of operations
for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by
changes in circumstances relating to these proceedings.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
In connection with a contaminated leased store property vacated by the Company
upon relocation in 2002, the Company has agreed to indemnify the property owner
with respect to an environmental liability associated with the use of the
property, as defined in the related lease agreement. During fiscal 2003, the
Company has not paid or accrued material amounts related to this property. The
Company does not expect the expense of these activities to exceed $01 million;
however, because of the uncertainties associated with environmental assessment
and remediation activities, the Company future expenses to remediate the
currently identified site could be higher than amounts accrued. Future
expenditures for environmental remediation may be affected in the near-term by
identification of additional contaminated sites, the level and type of
contamination found, and the extent and nature of cleanup activities required.
NOTE 18 - IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities VIE, an
Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 FIN 46. The
40          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Interpretation provides guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable
interest entity and evaluation for consolidation based on a company variable
interests. The Interpretation is effective 1 immediately for VIEs created
after January 31, 2003 and 2 in the first interim period ending after March
15, 2004 for VIEs created prior to February 1, 2003. The Company has no variable
interest entities and the adoption of FIN 46 had no impact on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
NOTE 19 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In January 2004, the Company purchased the land and building related to its
distribution center in Pendleton, Indiana for $153 million. The facility was
originally built to the Company specifications and has been leased since 1999.
On January 28, 2004, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the maturity
date to February 28, 2007. Additionally, the amendment included changes to
certain financial covenants, primarily to provide flexibility for capital
expenditures. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants at December
27, 2003.
In January 2004, the Company entered into a lease agreement that will
consolidate multiple headquarter facilities within one new location. The Company
expects to incur incremental after tax costs of approximately $20 million
unaudited primarily due to abandonment of the current leases.                    41 Item 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
