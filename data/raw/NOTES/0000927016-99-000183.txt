REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Maxwell Shoe Company Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Maxwell Shoe
Company Inc. as of October 31, 1997 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended October 31, 1998. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Maxwell
Shoe Company Inc. at October 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                  ERNST & YOUNG LLP Boston, Massachusetts

October 31, 1998
1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.  Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company sells footwear for women and children to retailers located
throughout the United States, Canada and Japan. The Company performs periodic
credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not
require collateral. Credit losses have been within or below management
expectations. In fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998 one customer accounted for
approximately 15%, 19% and 18% respectively, of net sales. During 1996, this one
customer was acquired by another customer of the Company. Had these two
customers been treated as one account for fiscal year 1996, they would have
accounted for approximately 22% of net sales.  Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  Recognition of Revenue
Sales are recognized upon shipment of products.  Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash, checking accounts and all highly-liquid debt instruments with
original maturities three months or less are deemed to be cash and cash
equivalents.  Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in,
first-out method.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Dollars in Thousands -- except per share amounts  Long Term Assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using
both straight line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of
these assets or the lease term, if shorter. The estimated useful lives of these
assets are as follows    Asset                      Useful Life
Furniture and    5 Years
Warehouse    7 Years
Leasehold    7 Years
Computer    5 Years
In August 1996, the Company acquired the rights to the Sam & Libby and certain
related trademarks and tradenames for $55 million cash. The trademarks and
tradenames are being amortized on a straight line basis over 15 years, their
estimated useful lives. Amortization began in 1997 when sale of product with the
trademark names commenced. Accumulated amortization at October 31, 1997 and 1998
was $367 and $733, respectively. Operating Expenses
General and administrative expenses include the cost of warehousing and
shipping operations. Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense including
cooperative advertising with retailers amounted to $1,546, $2,502 and $3,852
for the years ended October 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the liability method for accounting for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are
measured using the enacted tax rates and law that will be in effect when the
differences reverse. Deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance
to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization.  Earnings Per Common Share
In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share. Statement 128
replaced the previously reported primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share,
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants, and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. The Company adopted
Statement 128 in fiscal 1998 and, accordingly, all earnings per share amounts
for all periods have been presented, and where necessary, restated to conform to
the Statement 128 requirements.
29
MAXWELL SHOE COMPANY INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Dollars in Thousands -- except per share amounts   Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is
computed based on basic shares outstanding increased by incremental shares
assumed issued for dilutive common stock equivalents in the form of stock
options. Forward Exchange Contracts
The Company uses forward exchange contracts to manage its foreign currency
exposure. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on contracts that hedge
anticipated cash flows are determined by comparison of contract values to
current market values upon execution of a contract realized and at each
balance sheet date for open contracts unrealized. Resulting gains and losses
are recognized in other income and expense $275 gain in 1996, $76 loss in 1997
and $13 gain in 1998.  Stock Based Compensation
The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees,
generally with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the
date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB 25 and, accordingly, recognizes no compensation expense for
the stock option grants when the exercise price equals the fair value of the
shares at the date of grant.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. These provisions require the Company to disclose pro forma net
income and earnings per share amounts as if compensation related to grants of
stock options were recognized based on the fair value of such options see 
Note 5.  Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income FAS 130 and Statement
No. 131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
FAS 131. FAS 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components. FAS 131 establishes standards for
public companies to report information about operating segments in financial
statements, and supersedes FAS 14, Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business Enterprise, but retains the requirements to report information about
major customers. FAS 130 and FAS 131 are effective for the Company in fiscal
1999. The Company does not believe the adoption of these Statements will have a
material effect on the Company financial statements.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which
provides for the recognition and measurement of derivatives and hedging
activities. The Statement is effective for years beginning after June 15, 1999,
however companies may early adopt as of the beginning of any fiscal quarter.
Management of the Company does not expect the adoption of this Statement to have
a material impact on the Company financial statements.

At October 31, 1997 and 1998, there were 14,150 shares and 263,443 shares
available, respectively, for future grants under stock option plans.
In 1994, in consideration for the termination of a deferred compensation
agreement, the Board of Directors approved a non-transferable stock option grant
to the CEO for the purchase of 888,412 shares of Class A Common Stock at an
exercise price of $150 per share. The grant was outside of the Company stock
option plan, and the stock options were immediately exercisable. In connection
with the public stock offering, the CEO exercised a portion of these options to
purchase 300,000 shares of common stock. At October 31, 1998, 588,412 shares
remained outstanding.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123 utilizes the fair value method of
accounting for employee stock options. Under this method, compensation expense
for stock-based compensation plans is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period. In
accordance with FAS 123, the Company has elected to continue to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its employee
stock options. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized as long as
the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date
of grant.

Dollars in Thousands -- except per share amounts   Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS 123, which also requires that the information be determined as
if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options and other stock-
based compensation granted subsequent to October 31, 1995 under the fair value
method of that Statement. The fair value for these options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates ranging from 526% to
689%; dividend yield of 0%; volatility factor of the expected market price of
the Company common stock of 634% for 1996 and 1997 and 612% for 1998; and a
weighted average expected life of 51 years for options granted in 1996 and 1997
and 50 years for options granted in 1998. For purposes of pro forma
disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense
over the options' vesting period.                                            Year ended

Company vest over several years and additional awards may be made in future
years.
Stockholder Rights Plan
The Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan, under which each outstanding
share of the Company Class A common stock carries one Common Stock Purchase
Right. The rights may only become exercisable under certain circumstances
involving acquisition of the Company common stock by a person or group of
persons without the prior written consent of the Company board. Depending on
the circumstances, if the rights become exercisable, the holder of rights may be
entitled to purchase shares of the Company Class A common stock or shares of
common stock of the acquiring person at discounted prices. The rights will
expire on November 2, 2008 unless they are earlier exercised, redeemed or
exchanged.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company deferred tax liabilities and assets as of October 31 were as
follows                                        1997     1998

Total deferred tax      111     1,589
Net deferred tax assets  $  1,415   $  515
FAS 109 requires a Company to recognize a valuation allowance if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. In connection with the stock option compensation discussed in Note 5,
the Company recorded a valuation allowance in 1994 for the related deferred tax
asset. The stock option compensation is deductible for tax purposes upon
exercise of the option. During 1998, a portion of the options were exercised
and a proportionate share of the valuation allowance was reduced resulting in a
tax benefit of $946, which is included in the income tax provision.
Furthermore, for tax purposes, the Company recognized additional compensation
expense for the difference between the market price at the date of grant and the
market price at the date of exercise. This additional tax benefit of $869 has
been recorded as a reduction of current taxes payable and an increase in
additional paid-in-capital.
Significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows                               1996       1997       1998

7. Profit-Sharing Plan
The Company has a contributory 401k profit-sharing plan covering
substantially all employees. Employees may contribute up to 15% of their pre-
tax salary subject to statutory limitations. The plan requires the Company to
match 100% of employee contributions up to 2% of total employee compensation.
The plan also allows for additional discretionary Company contributions. Total
plan expense amounted to $200, $300 and $350 for fiscal years 1996, 1997 and
1998, respectively. 8. Commitments
The Company leases equipment and office and warehouse space under long-term
non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through January
31, 2007. These leases require the Company to pay the real estate taxes on the
real property. The Company also leases equipment under capital leases.
At October 31, 1998, future minimum payments under such leases were as

Rent expense for the years ended October 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 was $639 831 and $981, respectively.
The Company is a licensee under three agreements which allow for the
manufacture and sale of various items of footwear. The agreements require the
payment of royalties on qualified product sales and generally guarantee minimum
royalty payments regardless of sales volume. In April 1997, the Company
exercised its option to renew the license agreement with Jones Investment Co.,
Inc. the Jones Agreement through December 31, 2002 which requires a minimum
royalty payments ranging from $800 to $1,250 per annum during the period ending
December 31, 2002. The April 1997 amendment also granted the Company three
five-year option periods to renew through December 2017, subject to satisfying
certain conditions. The three option periods require

Dollars in Thousands -- except per share amounts minimum royalty payments of $1,250 per annum. In April 1997, the Company entered
into a license agreement with J. G. Hook, Inc. the Hook agreement for an
initial 18 month period ending September 30, 1998, with two one-year option
periods. In September 1998, the Company exercised its first one year option and
renewed the agreement through September 1999. On November 13, 1998, the Company
entered into a license agreement with Levi Strauss Co. which allows for the
manufacture and sale of a full range of women casual footwear under the
DockersR brand name. The agreement requires the payment of royalties on
qualified sales and guarantees minimum royalty payments. The minimum royalty
ranges from $144 to $864 through the initial term ending December 31, 2001.
There is one four-year option to renew through December 31, 2005, subject to
satisfying certain conditions.
In January 1997, the Company entered into a license agreement with Inter-
Pacific Corporation IPC, which provides IPC with the exclusive rights to
design, manufacture and distribute Sam & Libby beachwear type footwear for an
initial term of January 1997 to May 2000. For the use of the Sam & Libby
tradename, IPC will pay the Company royalties based on qualified product sales
subject to payment of minimum royalties of $396 over the initial term of the
agreement. Upon satisfaction of certain conditions, IPC may exercise its option
to extend the license agreement until May 2003.
On April 14, 1997 the Company completed a transaction to own and operate
retail women footwear stores through a joint venture, SLJ Retail LLC SLJ,
which sells a complete selection of women footwear under the Sam & Libby and
Jones New York brand names. Initially, the joint venture was 49% owned by the
Company, which will account for its ownership under the equity method, and 51%
owned by the Butler Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric
Capital Corporation. The Company also holds an option through February 1, 2000
to purchase additional equity in the joint venture to increase its equity
ownership by approximately 5%. Under certain circumstances, the Company may be
obligated to acquire the ownership interest of the Butler Group at a value based
upon the operating results of SLJ Retail. The Company also entered into an
agreement to provide management services to SLJ Retail.
Summarized financial information of SLJ Retail as of October 31, 1998 and
for the year then ended is as follows: current assets - $12,286, non-current
assets - $5,836, current liabilities - $8,866, non-current liabilities 32,958, net sales - $41,405, gross profit - $19,270 and net operating loss 22,756. The Company has not recognized any portion of SLJ Retail net
operating losses through October 31, 1998 because, under the equity method of
accounting, the Company does not recognize any losses beyond the carrying value
of its investment in SLJ Retail, which is zero.
Simultaneously with the formation of SLJ Retail, the Company entered into a
sub-license agreement with SLJ Retail pursuant to which the Company granted to
SLJ Retail a sub-license of its rights under the Jones Agreement noted above.
The initial term of this sub-license agreement expires in December 2002, but is
extended automatically for the same period of time as any extension by the
Company of the Jones Agreement. The sub-license agreement is subject to early
termination for various reasons, including any termination of the Jones
Agreement. In addition, the Company entered into a retail license agreement the
Retail License Agreement with SLJ Retail pursuant to which the Company
granted to SLJ Retail a license, throughout the United States and such other
locations outside the United States, in which SLJ Retail may manufacture and
sell Sam & Libby women footwear products, provided however, that such license
does not extend to products to which IPC has the exclusive rights. Under the
Retail License Agreement, SLJ Retail does not have to pay any royalty to the
Company in consideration of the license granted. The initial term of the Retail
License Agreement expires on January 31, 2047, subject to earlier termination
upon the occurrence of certain specified events.
