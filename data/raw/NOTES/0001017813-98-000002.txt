YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 
PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 22, 1995 INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 1995
-  1.  BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization - Patient Infosystems, Inc. designs and develops health care
information systems and services to manage, collect and analyze patient-related
information to improve patient compliance with prescribed treatment protocols.
Through its various patient compliance programs for disease state management,
the Company provides important benefits for the patient, the health care
provider and the payor. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on February 22,
1995 under the name DSMI Corp., changed its name to Disease State Management,
Inc. on October 13, 1995, and on June 28, 1996 changed its name to Patient
Infosystems,  Inc. Prior to January 1, 1997, the Company was a development
stage enterprise.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ
from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company financial instruments
consist of cash and equivalents and available-for-sale securities. The carrying
values of cash and equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities
approximate fair value.
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue - The Company principal source of
revenue to date has been from contracts with a pharmaceutical company for the
development and operation of disease management programs for chronic diseases,
disease  management  programs and other health care  information  system
applications. Deferred revenue represents amounts billed in advance under these
contracts.
Development Contracts - The Company program development contracts typically
require payment from the customer at the time that the contract is executed,
with additional payments made as certain development milestones are met.
Development contract revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis,
in accordance with the ratio of total development cost incurred to the estimated
total development costs for the entire project.
Losses, if any, are recognized in full as identified.
Program Operations - The Company program operation contracts call for a per
enrolled patient fee to be paid by the customer for a series of program services
as defined in the contract. The timing of customer payments varies by contract,
but typically occurs in advance of the associated services being provided.
Revenues from program operations are recognized ratably as the program services
are delivered.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid
debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments which potentially subject
the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash
equivalents with high credit quality institutions.
The Company current contracts are concentrated in a small number of customers,
consequently, the loss of any one of its customers could have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its operations. During the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1996, approximately $925,800 45% and $834,000 99%, respectively, of
the Company revenues arose from contracts with one customer. At December 31,
1997 and 1996, accounts receivable included balances of $231,484 and $265,940,
respectively, from contracts with that customer.
Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation
is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years.
The Company regularly assesses all of its long lived assets for impairment and
recognizes a loss when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value.
The Company determined that no impairment loss need be recognized for applicable
assets in 1997 or 1996.
Research and Development - Research and development costs consist principally of
compensation and benefits paid to Company  employees.  All research and
development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the asset and liability method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Net Loss Per Share - Net loss per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding subsequent to the Company initial public offering
in 1996. Pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff, all
common and potential common shares issued by the Company at a price less than
the initial public offering price during at least the 12 months preceding the
offering date using the treasury stock method until shares are issued have
been included in the calculation of common and potential common shares
outstanding for all periods presented prior to the December 1996 initial public
offering.
Retirement Plan - The Company has a retirement plan which qualifies under
Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code This retirement plan allows eligible
employees to contribute 1% to 15% of their income on a pretax basis to the plan.
The Company annual contribution to the plan is at the discretion of the Board
of Directors. The Company made no contributions to this plan in 1997 or 1996.
Stock Split - On November 22, 1996, the Company effected a 72-for-1 reverse
stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128 - In March 1997, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. The new standard
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share EPS on the
face of the statement of operations and requires a reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of basic and diluted EPS calculations. The statement
is effective for periods ending after December 15, 1997.  The  Company  has 
calculated and presented basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of 
the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 and
from the period of February 1995 inception to December 31, 1995.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 - In June 1997, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which is
required to be adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. This
statement establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements.
This statement requires that all items that are required to be recognized under
accounting standards as components of comprehensive income to be reported in a
financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other
financial statements. In the opinion of management, SFAS 130 will not have a 
material effect on the Company financial statements. 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 - In June 1997 the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The statement
requires that a public company report financial and descriptive information
about its reportable operating segments using the management approach. In the 
opinion of management, SFAS 131 will not have a material effect on the Company'
financial statements.
Statement of Position 97-2 - In October 1997, the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee  issued  Statement of Position SOP 97-2,  Software  Revenue
Recognition, which provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting
principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions and is effective for
transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The
Company does not believe that the implementation of SOP 97-2 will have a
material effect on expected revenues or earnings. 2.  AVAILABLE -FOR-SALE SECURITIES

1997 U.S. Government securities      $12,232,335

4.  INCOME TAXES
The Company has not recorded any income tax expense during the period from
Inception to  December 31, 1997 because of operating losses incurred since
inception
As of December 31, 1997, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal income tax purposes of approximately $7,100,000 which are available to
offset future Federal taxable income. These carryforwards expire in varying
amounts through 2012. No tax benefit relating to the net operating loss
carryforwards has been reflected in the financial statements due to the
uncertainty regarding the utilization of any such benefit, and valuation
allowances of $2,414,000 for 1997 and $1,326,000 for 1996 have been recognized
to offset any deferred tax asset related to these carryforwards. Future benefit
may occur to the extent taxable income is earned prior to the expiration of the
carryforward period. 5.  PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK
In December 1996, the Company sold 2,000,000 shares of common stock through an
initial public offering which generated net proceeds of $14,082,048 after
deducting applicable issuance costs and expenses. On January 8, 1997, an
additional 300,000 shares of common stock were sold pursuant to an underwriters
over-allotment provision, which generated net proceeds to the Company of
$2,232,000 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
In connection with this initial public offering, the Company outstanding
shares of Series A and B convertible preferred stock were converted into
2,046,000 shares of common stock. 6.  STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS
The Company has an Employee Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan for the
benefit of certain employees, non-employee directors, and key advisors. The
Company has adopted the disclosures-only provision of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Stock Option Plan
as it relates to employees. Had compensation cost for the Company stock option
plan been determined based on the fair value at the date of grant for awards
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and net
loss per share would have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated

Black-Scholes option-pricing model using an assumed risk-free interest rates of
598% for the year ended December 31, 1997 and 7% for the year ended December
31, 1996 and an expected life of 7 years. As the Company was still considered a
private company for the purposes of applying SFAS No. 123 for the period from
Inception to June 30, 1996, the Company did not include a volatility factor
assumption in its fair value model. For the options granted after July 1, 1996,
the Company has used a volatility factor of 53 for year ended December 31, 1997
and 60 for year ended December 31, 1996. For purposes of pro forma disclosure,
the estimated fair value of each option is amortized to expense over that
option vesting period. The Stock Option Plan authorizes 1,080,000 shares of
common stock to be issued.
Stock options granted under the Stock Option Plan may be of two types: 1
incentive stock options and 2 nonqualified stock options. The option price of
such grants shall be determined by a Committee of the Board of Directors the
Committee, but shall not be less than the estimated fair market value of the
common stock at the date the option is granted. The terms of the grants shall be
fixed by the Committee, with no term lasting longer than ten years. The ability
to exercise such options shall be determined by the Committee when the options
are granted. All of the outstanding options vest at the rate of 20% per year
with the exception of 36,000 options which were vested as of the date of grant.
