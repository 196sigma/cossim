Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a
Nature of Business iGATE Corporation the Company is a worldwide provider of information technology IT and
offshore outsourcing services to large and medium-sized organizations. b Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% of equity or otherwise acquires management influence using the equity method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Investments in which the Company acquires less than a 20% interest, or in which the Company does not acquire management
influence, are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or, if publicly traded, as available-for-sale securities. c Uses of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. d Reclassifications Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to 2006 presentations. e Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash
and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. f Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of money market funds and corporate bonds and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. g Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Receivables The Company extends credit to clients based upon managements
assessment of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of the Companys revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from Global 2000 companies, major systems integrators and governmental agencies. Unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of
client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods.

31, 2006 AND 2005 
h Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the
combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible, as well as judgments made by the Company based upon historical and expected charge-off experience. i Employee Advances Employees can
be advanced up to $2,500 at the discretion of the Company. Normally, advances are based upon financial need at date of hire. Advances are deducted from the employees salary over a six-month period or until paid in full. j Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The Company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS 115. The Company has determined that certain of its investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, utilizing the investments closing price at each
reporting period. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of
Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Income Loss. The unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the Companys original cost for an investment and the investments fair value at each reporting period. Realized gains or
losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method. If management determines that an investment in
available for sale securities has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value, by a charge to earnings. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that
are considered by the Company in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability
to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. In evaluating these
factors above, management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a period of six months or more the 20% criteria. However,
the presumption of an other-than-temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature e.g., strong operating performance of investee, historical volatility of
investee, etc. Additionally, there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the 20% criteria is not satisfied e.g., plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the Companys cost basis. No
such impairment losses were incurred in 2006 or 2005 or 2004. For investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting,
management evaluates information e.g., budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc. in addition to quoted market price, if any, in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists. Factors indicative of an
other-than-temporary decline include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment. This list is not all inclusive and management weighs all 
46 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2006 AND 2005 
quantitative factors in determining if an other-than-temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. In 2005, the Company recorded an impairment of
$25 million on its investment in Concours, Inc. There were no impairments recorded in 2006 or 2004. k Land, Building, Equipment and
Leasehold Improvements Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Companys accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in loss from operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Improvement and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are as follows:  Building
25 years
Laptop Computers
18 months
Equipment
35 years
Leasehold Improvements
Shorter of the life of the improvement or lease term ranging from 3 to 10 years
l Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired but will be subject to an annual impairment assessment of their
carrying value, or more frequently if circumstances change. Under SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to, at a minimum, an
annual impairment assessment of their carrying value. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments
were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology, recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof. There were no impairments for the years presented. The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:  Intellectual property
35years
Customer relationships
36 years
Beneficial employment contracts
24 years
The Company assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including land, building,
equipment and leasehold improvement and amortizable intangible assets, whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired when
the sum of the undiscounted expected future net operating cash flows is less than the carrying values of the related assets. 
47 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2006 AND 2005 
m Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities. The Company has evaluated its deferred tax asset
and has recorded a valuation allowance where appropriate. Historically, the government of India has provided incentives, in the form of
tax holidays, to encourage foreign investment. Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, the Companys Indian subsidiary is eligible to claim a tax holiday for 10 consecutive assessment years on profits derived from the export of software services
from divisions registered under the Software Technology Parks at Bangalore, Chennai and Pune. The benefits of the holiday began to expire for certain of the units in 2005. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on basis differences in its non-U.S. subsidiaries of $48 million
that result primarily from undistributed earnings the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these basis differences is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on
circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. n Minority Interest Minority interest represents the proportionate share of outside equity holders. At December31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had outside equity holders
for the following Companies:  Percentage Outside Ownership 2006 2005 iGATE Global Solutions Ltd. iGS
182 184 Quintant, Inc. Quintant
182 184 iGATE Clinical Research International Private Ltd. ICRI
5 5 LoanPro
490 iGS is a publicly held Company in India. All outside shareholders may vote. o Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that fair value: Cash and short-term investmentsThe carrying amount approximates market value. Accounts receivableThe carrying amount approximates market. Revolving credit facilityThe carrying amount approximates market value. The outstanding balance is reflected at its outstanding face value, excluding unpaid accrued interest at an interest rate range,
dependent upon the level of borrowings, at the lesser of the current LIBOR rate +100% to +250% or the Prime rate +050%, calculated on a per annum basis. Accounts payableThe carrying amount approximates market. 
48 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2006 AND 2005 
p Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging currency, price, and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing
business operations. The Company carries derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, determined by reference to quoted market prices. Derivatives are included in other assets and other liabilities based on the instruments fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it. The cash flows related to derivative
instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities as a component of other items, net. The Company recorded $15 million in other income in 2006 and $13 million in other expense in 2005 related to its foreign currency hedging transactions. q Stock-Based Employee Compensation The Company recognizes compensation expense for all
stock-based awards, using a fair value approach as prescribed in SFAS No123R Share Based Payments. The impact of the adoption is more fully described in Note 11 Stock Based Compensation. r Currency Translation Adjustment For all significant foreign operations, the functional currency is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Statement of Operations accounts are
translated at the average exchange rate prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gain and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in other income expense, net for the periods presented. Foreign exchange gains or losses on
intercompany loans from the Company to its operating subsidiaries are recorded as a component of other income if payment is expected in the foreseeable future based upon mutually agreed upon payment terms. s Revenue Recognition The Company
recognizes revenue on time-and-materials contracts as the services are performed. Revenue is earned when the Companys consultants are working on projects. Revenue recognition is negatively impacted by national holidays and consultant vacation
and sick days. Revenues on fixed-price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method. Performance is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract and revenue is
recognized based upon costs incurred by the Companys consultants during the period. The Company follows this revenue recognition method for fixed-price contracts because there is a direct and consistent relationship between the service
patterns and services provided to the customer and the direct costs incurred to provide such services. If the Companys cost estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed-price contract, we record a provision for the estimated loss without
regard to the stage of completion. Changes in job performance, conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified. Contracts with deliverables or
project milestones recognize revenue as the deliverables or project milestones are achieved. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones can provide for certain penalties if the deliverables or project milestones are 
49 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2006 AND 2005 
not met within contract timelines. Certain maintenance type contracts with no stated deliverables, with a designated workforce assigned, recognize revenues
on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which are typically one year in duration. Revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract. In certain client situations, where the nature of the engagement requires it, we utilize the services of other companies in our industry. If these
services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs, we classify the amount billed to the client as subcontractor revenue.
These revenues, however, are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client. All revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other independent contractors who work directly
for us are recorded as direct revenue. t Software Implementation Costs The Company accounts for costs incurred for its own information systems upgrades in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that both internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage should be charged to operations as
incurred. Such costs incurred during the application development stage should be capitalized; training costs incurred in this stage should, however, be expensed. Costs of upgrades and enhancements should be capitalized but only during the
application development stage if it is probable that the expenditures will result in added functionality for the software. During the post-implementation/operation stage, training costs both internal and external and maintenance costs should be
charged to operations. u Issuance of Stock by Subsidiaries All issuances of subsidiary stock options or restricted stock and stock compensation expense recorded in accordance with SFAS 123R are treated as equity
transactions. v Acquisitions The Companys acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase price over the fair
market value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations since the dates of the acquisitions. See Note 12 for additional information.
w Discontinued Operations The Company adopted SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, SFAS 144 effective January1, 2002. This standard establishes accounting and reporting requirements for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company applied the provisions of SFAS 144 related to the sale of its Australian Australia and Direct Resources International DRI subsidiaries in 2004. Managements plan to divest and the divestures both occurred within the same period for reporting purposes. Australia and DRI were classified in the
Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. The balance sheet amounts and statement results were reclassified to discontinued operations for both the 
50 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER

Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations presentation. The discontinued operations on the Statement of Operations were reported, net of applicable statutory
taxes and net of gains on the sales of Australia and DRI. Additionally, segment information does not include the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations. x Net Income per Share The Company
calculates net income per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted shares included in this calculation are determined using the treasury stock method. y Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes as amended FIN 48, an interpretation of SFAS 109. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition, classification,
interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this Interpretation is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: The enterprise determines whether it is
more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that
meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. This Interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on its Consolidated Financial
Statements. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No157 Fair Value
Measurements FASB 157. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. However, for some entities, the application of this Statement will change current practice. This
Statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is encouraged, provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued
financial statements for that fiscal year, including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

recognized for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $09 million and $09 million, respectively, for the restricted stock. All options issued at $000 exercise price and $378 exercise price were valued based upon the closing price of the Company stock at the date of grant. Deferred compensation was being recognized ratably over a four

of restricted Company Common Stock to a key executive as part of his employment agreement. These shares vest ratably over a two year period with a compensation charge equal to the fair value of the shares awarded at date of grant. Had compensation
costs for these shares been determined consistent with SFAS 123, net loss and loss per share for the year ended December31, 2004 would have increased by approximately $03 million or less than $001 per share. Deferred compensation recognized
for these shares for the year ended December31, 2005, and 2004, respectively was approximately $01 million and less than $01 million. iGATE Corporation Stock Option Plans Stock Based Compensation In December2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No123R, which requires compensation costs
related to share-based transactions, including employee share options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No123Rrevised SFAS No123, as amended, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
and supersedes APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Effective January1, 2006, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No123Rusing the modified prospective transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation cost recognized beginning January1, 2006 includes compensation cost for iall
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested 
59 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
as of January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123, and iiall
share-based payments granted subsequent to December31, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123R. Compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service
period or the retirement date for retirement eligible employees, if earlier. Prior period amounts have not been restated. As a result of
the adoption of SFAS No123R, the Companys results for the year ended December31, 2006 include share-based compensation expense of $40 million. The total stock-based compensation cost has been included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations within direct costs of $18 million and within selling, general and administrative expenses of $22 million. The Company has recognized a related tax benefit associated with its share-based compensation arrangements for
totaling $01 million. Prior to January1, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the
provisions of APB Opinion No25, as permitted by SFAS No123, and accordingly did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grant. The

During 2006, the Company granted 06million shares of performance based restricted stock. Each
share is earned only after certain financial targets are met. Each performance target is assessed yearly over a four year to five year period, at which time the shares will be awarded upon achievement of the yearly target. If the performance targets
are not met, the shares that were to be awarded for the performance year will be cancelled. If the performance target is achieved, the shares are issued to the recipient. These shares are voting but are subject to forfeiture if performance targets
are not achieved or in the event of termination. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, options covering a total of 01million shares,
02million shares and 06million shares, respectively, of Common Stock were granted under the Plan. Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant or earlier if an option holder ceases to be employed or associated by the
Company for any reason. Compensation expense associated with the performance based grants that continue to vest based upon future
performance is measured based on the grant-date fair value of iGATE common stock. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based upon the Companys estimated achievement of the established performance criteria.
Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that are expected to vest, which is estimated based upon the assessment of both the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and current period and historical forfeitures.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006 and 2005 was $06 million and $02 million, respectively. The fair value of
stock options vested during 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $08 million, $11 million and $11 million, respectively. The income tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $01 million, less than $01 million and $03
million, respectively. In 2006, the Company recognized $09million of compensation expense associated with the iGATE stock incentive
plan in the Companys Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December31, 2006, approximately $34 million of unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized for the unvested shares. This expense is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 19 years. iGATE Stock Options Outstanding at December31, 2006:  Options Outstanding

77 30 iGS also maintains anemployee restricted stock unit plan herein referred to as RSU
Plan. The RSU Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee appointed by the Board of Directors of iGS. The RSU Plan is a separate plan set up in partial modification of the above iGS Plans and provides for the issuance of a maximum of
30million shares of iGS common stock. These restricted stock units are granted at a $009 strike price. Restricted stock unit
grants for the RSU Plan generally vest over a four year period and expire twelve years from the date of grant or earlier if a holder ceases to be employed by or associated with iGS for any reason. On October10, 2006, iGS exchanged approximately 175million of iGS employee stock options for approximately 05million of iGS
restricted stock units. The proposed exchange was approved by iGSs Board on October10, 2006. The exchange was not mandatory and was solely the prerogative of each employee. At the date of the exchange the iGS closing stock price was
$420. The fair value of restricted stock unit grants was estimated using the prevailing market value of iGS common stock at the date of
grant. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. A forfeiture rate is also applied to the estimated compensation cost of the granted restricted
stock units. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.

The fair value of each option grant under the iGATE Plans and iGS Plans was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain
assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of either the iGATE or iGS common stock and implied volatility derived from exchange traded options. The average expected life
was based on the contractual term of the option and expected employee exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for each of the iGATE Plans was based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining
term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The risk-free rate for each of the iGS Plans was based on an equivalent Indian risk-free rate. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of
actual option forfeitures. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:  Year Ended December31, 2006

Acquisitions The following paragraphs describe
each of the acquisitions made by the Company during 2006, 2005 and 2004. Descriptions regarding each acquisition will vary dependent upon the complexity of the transaction and materiality and are presented in chronological order. Unless otherwise
noted, pro-forma disclosure regarding these purchases have not been provided because they are not material to the operations of the Company. The Company has calculated each purchase price allocation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations. All purchase price allocations have been finalized at December31,
2006. All amortizable intangible assets acquired consist of intellectual property, beneficial employment contracts and customer relationships. Please refer to Note 5 for information pertaining to amortization expense. On April24, 2006, iGS entered into a Master Services Agreement with LoanPro, LLC LoanPro to perform offshore mortgage servicing. In
conjunction with this agreement, iGS acquired a 5% ownership interest 
66 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
in LoanPro for a nominal amount with the option to acquire up to an additional 55%. iGS exercised this option on July1, 2006 and acquired the
additional 55% of LoanPro for a nominal amount. In the third quarter of 2006, iGS consolidated LoanPros operations into the iGATE Solutions segment. iGS has loaned $11 million to LoanPro as of February28, 2007. The loan pays 6% interest
and is due in 2009. Assets acquired were insignificant and did not require a purchase price allocation. Proforma disclosure was also not required due to immateriality. During the fourth quarter of 2005, iGS purchased the remaining 51% interest of CIBER, India Pvt. Ltd., CIBER, an India-based joint venture originally started in 2003 by Ciber, Inc. and iGS, for a nominal
amount. The acquisition was deemed to be immaterial not requiring pro-forma disclosure. Assets acquired were insignificant and did not require a purchase price allocation. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company acquired the remaining 10% of ICRI it did not own from the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Cancer
Services UPCI. Pursuant to the transaction, ICRI transferred certain clinical research related study agreements to UPCI for the remaining 10% ownership, whose value was immaterial. On August10, 2004, the Company modified the terms of the acquisition agreement dated as of August21, 2003 relating to its acquisition of
Quintant Inc. Initial Quintant Transaction Structure, and entered into a new agreement with the founders and principal shareholders of Quintant Modified Quintant Transaction Structure. The principal reasons that the
Quintant acquisition structure was modified were ato have the Quintant co-founders more closely aligned to the stock value of iGS, rather than the Companys common stock, and bto simplify the ownership structure of Quintant
whereby Quintant will be owned 100% by iGS, rather than the original ownership structure where Quintant was jointly owned by iGS and iGATE. Under the terms of the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure, the Company was required to accelerate compensation expense, which is more fully discussed in Note 11, and to pay the Quintant Co-Founders an additional $39 million in cash
consisting of $32 million paid to Quintants Indian Co-Founder and $07 million paid in aggregate to the four Quintant Co-Founders. The costs associated with the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure did not affect the Companys
original purchase price allocation, which is discussed below. All costs incurred as part of the Modified Quintant Transaction Structure
were recorded as compensation expense in the period incurred and are included in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of iGATE Solutions segment.  13.
Discontinued Operations In 2004, the Company sold
two international staffing company subsidiaries, iGATE Australia Pty Ltd. iGATE Australia, headquartered in Sydney, Australia, and Direct Resources Scotland Ltd., DRI located in Edinburgh, Scotland the
Dispositions. In accordance with SFAS 144, these businesses are classified as discontinued operations. The sale of iGATE
Australia was a stock for cash transaction and was completed on June2, 2004. The Company sold DRI customer and contractor agreements for cash on April1, 2004. For the year ended December31, 2004, both operations combined had
approximately $205 million in revenues with operating income of approximately $01 million. The purchase price received in cash for both transactions was approximately $98million.

computation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method. In addition, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for
2004 would have included 04million shares for assumed exercise of options under the Companys share incentive plans. However, because the Company was in a net loss position inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive.

Shared Services activities include general corporate expenses, interest income and expense, equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates, minority interest, loss from joint
ventures and restructuring charges not identified to a specific segment, and other unallocated charges. The Company evaluates segments based on income loss from operations. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses or income
sources have not been allocated to the operating business segments, this basis is not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and it may not be comparable to other companies.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and
Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Company
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15b and 15d-15b. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. The results of managements assessment were reviewed with the Companys Audit Committee. The certification required
by Section302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 3101 and 3102, respectively, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.A. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established policies or
procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in the
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based upon this assessment, management believes that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2006. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There has been no change in iGATEs internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006.

established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our
opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Standards Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of iGate Corporation as of December31, 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated March13, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin March13, 2007
