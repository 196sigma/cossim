38 REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Natrol,Inc. and its Subsidiaries
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Natrol,Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December31, 2006
and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31,
2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at a2. These consolidated financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Natrol,Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December31, 2006
and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all
material respects the information set forththerein.
As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.Business
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Natrol,Inc. and subsidiaries collectively, the Company
manufactures and markets branded, high-quality dietary supplement products
under the branded labels, Natrol, Laci Le Beau, Nu Hair, Shen Min, Promensil,
Trinovin and Prolab. Our core brands market vitamins, minerals, hormonal and
herbal supplements, herbal teas, specialty combination formulations and sports
nutrition products. We sell our products through multiple channels of
distribution that reach consumers through mass-market retailers, health food
stores, fitness centers, the Internet, catalogues and other points of
distribution in the United States and selected foreign countries.
We also sell raw materials
and market limited contract manufacturing through our EPI division, which
operates within our core operating unit.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts and operations of Natrol,Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts have been
eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates, although management does not believe any differences would
materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Significant Risks and Uncertainties
Product returns are a recurring part of our business.
Estimating product returns requires significant management judgment. Products
may be returned for various reasons including expiration dates or lack of
sufficient sales. During 2006, our expense for returns and reimbursements for
damages and outdated products amounted to 55% of gross shipments, a decrease
from the 62% of gross shipments experienced in 2005 but above the 35%
experienced in 2004. In past years, the rate of returns has been considerably
higher. There is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to, or
exceed, the levels experienced in the past. Furthermore, the possibility exists
that should we lose a major account, we may agree to accept a substantial
amount of returns.
We monitor our inventory
and analyze it on a regular basis. Cycle counts are taken daily to verify
inventory levels. In addition, we analyze the movement of items within our
inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold
or used before expiration dates are reached. We provide an allowance against
that portion of inventory that we believe is unlikely to be sold or used before
expiration dates are reached. At December31, 2006, inventory allowances
were approximately $10million. 44 Cash
The Companys cash was
held in four banks at December31, 2006 and, as a result of this, the
Company does not believe it is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the
normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents
cash that has been deposited with an insurance company as part of our
self-insurance program. The cash earns interest at a current rate of 165% per
annum, and will be returned should we terminate the policy. The policy, which
is cancelable by us, is effective through 2008.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the
lower of cost determined by the first-in, first-out method or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are
stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from three-to-ten years for
furniture, machinery and equipment. Buildings are depreciated over
fortyyears, and improvements are depreciated over periods ranging from
five-to-forty years, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold
improvements is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms. Depreciation expense
in the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to $1,389 1,338, and $1,277, respectively.
Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to
be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Goodwill
In June2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141
requires business combinations entered into after June30, 2001 to be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No142
requires that goodwill not be amortized, but be tested for impairment at least
annually. We adopted SFAS No142 on January1, 2002. We performed
our annual impairment test as of December31 for each of the years
presented and concluded that goodwill was not impaired. As part of our
impairment test, we considered a number of variables including, but not limited
to, the market capitalization of the Company, estimates of future earnings and
discounted cash flows, third party assessments of the value of the Company and
transactions involving the purchase and sale of businesses similar to ours.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are
provided for temporary differences between the financial statement and income
tax bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates. Management
provides a valuation  45 allowance
when it believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
Revenue Recognition
We sell our products to
retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national broker network. We
recognize revenue from sales when product is shipped and risk of loss is
transferred. We currently have no consignment accounts. If we had consignment
accounts we would not recognize revenue until product was sold by the
consignment account to the consumer. Net sales represent product shipped less
actual and estimated returns, spoilage allowances, allowances for product
deemed to be unsaleable by customers, and slotting fees, rebates and other
expenditures which, using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP in
the United States should be accounted for as reductions of revenue. Estimates
and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional
returns when the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated.
Advertising Costs
Advertising and
promotional costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotional costs
were in thousands $5,531, $7,073, and $6,122 for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These amounts are exclusive of brochure and
public relations expenses, as well as promotional and other costs that are netted
against sales revenue.
Research and Development Costs
Our research and
development costs are expensed as incurred and were in thousands $891, $964
and $752 for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Shipping and Handling Costs
We record all amounts
charged to customers for shipping and handling as revenue. All shipping and
fulfillment costs are classified as selling and marketing expenses and were in
thousands $3,353, $3,340 and $3,432 for the years ended December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Through the end of 2005, the Company measured
compensation for stock-based incentive programs utilizing the intrinsic value
method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
related interpretations. Under this method, the Company did not record
compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants
as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the
stock when the option was granted. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 and SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition
and Disclosure, the Company disclosed the pro forma net income per
share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring
compensation expense for stock-based incentive awards. No stock-based
compensation cost was recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations
for the years prior to 2006, as all unvested options granted had an exercise
price equal to or greater than the fair market value of the underlying common
stock on the date of grant.
In December2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share
Based Payment: An Amendment of FASB Statements No123 and 95
SFAS 123R. This statement requires that the cost resulting from all
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In addition, in March2005 the SEC released SEC
Staff Accounting Bulletin No107, Share-Based
Payment SAB 107. SAB 107 provides the SECs staffs position
regarding  46 the application of SFAS
123R and certain SEC rulesand regulations, and also provides the staffs
views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public
companies. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123R is similar to the approach
described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the
statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure of
fair value recognition, as prescribed under SFAS 123, is no longer an
alternative.
In 2006, the Company adopted the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123R utilizing the
method, as prescribed by SFAS 123R. Under the
transition method, compensation cost recognized for the year ended December31,
2006 includes: acompensation cost for all share-based payments granted
prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the grant
date fair value estimated in accordance with SFAS 123, and bcompensation
expense for all share-based payments granted subsequent to January1,
2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS 123R. Under the  method,
results for the prior periods have not been restated.
During the year ended December31, 2006, the Company
granted options to purchase 7,454,499 shares of common stock. Of the 7,454,499
shares, 6,029,500 options were granted to Wayne M. Bos upon his appointment as
the Companys CEO and President. This option award was approved by the
stockholders of the Company at its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders. The
remaining 1,424,999 options were granted to other employees and directors. The
options granted to Mr.Bos have certain service and performance conditions
which were discussed in the Companys proxy statement for the 2006 annual
meeting of stockholders. These options were fully vested upon grant, and we
recognized a related expense of $03million during the first quarter of
2006. During the year ended December31, 2006 we recorded a total expense
of approximately $06million as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R. 
The
effect of the change in applying the original provisions of SFAS 123 resulted
in lowering operating income, income before taxes, net income and basic and
diluted earnings per share as follows

The Company used a Monte Carlo method to simulate
stock price paths over the term of the 6,029,500 options awarded to Mr.Bos.
All other options were valued using a Black-Sholes model. The Monte Carlo
method, which is one acceptable valuation method per SFAS 123R, was used due to
many factors which make utilizing a Black-Sholes model inappropriate for a
block of options of this magnitude. These factors include but are not limited
to the size of the grant in relation to the total shares outstanding, the
trading volume of the Companys stock and the holders ability to resell the
shares, and the control factor, which the size of the grant implies. The
Company used the services of a well-credentialed group of valuation experts to
perform the valuation of Mr.Bos options. This group developed multiple
scenarios including continuing operation and sale scenarios, to assess the
potential to create shareholder value over the term of the options. The
resulting Monte Carlo analysis gave rise to a range of fair values for which
the mean amount was utilized in valuing the options for Mr.Bos.
All other stock options were valued using a
Black-Sholes model. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will continue to utilize the
Black-Sholes model to estimate the fair market value related to stock options
after January1, 2006, unless such method is clearly inappropriate for a
significant block of stock options, such as were granted to Mr.Bos. The
Companys assessment of the estimated compensation charges for these other
stock options is affected by its stock price as well as assumptions regarding a
number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact. These
variables include, but are not limited to the Companys stock price volatility
and expected employee stock option behavior.

The total fair value of the nonvested options as of December31,
2006 was $1,115,779.
The
Black-Sholes option-pricing model is used by the Company to determine the
weighted average fair value of stock options except for the Wayne Bos stock
options. The fair value of stock options at date of grant and the assumptions
utilized to determine such values are indicated in the following table

These assumptions resulted in weighted-average fair
values of $021, $154 and $166 for each stock option granted in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.
Income Loss Per Share
We calculate income loss per share in accordance
with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share.
Basic income loss per share has been computed by dividing net income loss
by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income loss per share has been computed by dividing net income loss
by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock
equivalents stock options.
Stock options to purchase
8,618,256, 2,310,820, and 2,442,000 shares of common stock at December31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, were outstanding and of these shares, 7,749,999,
2,310,820, and 520,000 were respectively considered anti-dilutive.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of
certain financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximates fair market value based on their
short-term nature. The fair value of the our long-term notes payable is
estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on our current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The estimated fair
value of long-term notes payable exceeded the carrying value by approximately
$03 million at December31, 2006. 49 Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to
concentration of credit risk, consist principally of cash and accounts
receivable. We believe our exposure as it relates to cash is limited due to the
fact that the cash we have is placed with several banks, each of which has a
strong financial position. Significant portions of our sales are made directly
to mass merchandisers and national retailers. Due to the increased volume of
sales to these channels, we have experienced an increased concentration of
credit risk, and as a result, may at anytime have individually significant
receivable balances with such mass merchandisers and national retailers. While
we monitor and manage this risk, financial difficulties on the part of one or
more major customers may have a material adverse effect. We perform ongoing
credit evaluations of customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit
losses.
Two of our customers represented more than 10% of net
sales for the year ended December31, 2006. The lead customer represented
114% of net sales and the second customer represented 109% of net sales. For
the year ended December31, 2005 only one customer, representing 128% of
net sales, accounted for more than 10% of net sales and no customer represented
more than 10% of net sales in2004.
One account represented
more than 10% of our accounts receivable at December31, 2006. Two
accounts represented more than 10% of our net accounts receivable as of December31,
2005.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In February2006, the FASB issued FASB Statement No155,
Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments. This Statement amends FASB
Statements No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, and No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. As we do not issue or
expect to issue hybrid financial instruments, we do not believe that the
adoption of FASB No155 will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 in June2006. The
interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscalyears beginning after December15, 2006. We have
not determined the effect, if any, the adoption of FIN48 will have on our
consolidated financial statements.
On June28, 2006 the Board of the FASB ratified
the conclusion reached by the EITF and contained therein in Issue No06-03.
The Task Force reached a conclusion that the presentation of taxes on either a
gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed
pursuant to Opinion 22. Currently, the Company presents its sales tax liability
on a net basis. Sales are not grossed up with the attendant taxes deducted as a
separate line item. The EITF becomes effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December15, 2006. At such time, the Company will
disclose this matter in its accounting policies.
In September2006, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No108, Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108. SAB108 provides
guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration
when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for
purposes of determining whether the current years financial statements are
materially misstated. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years ending on or after November15,
2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.
In September2006,
the FASB issued Statement SFAS No157 FAS157, Fair Value Measurements , which defines
fairvalue,establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and
expands  50 disclosures
regarding fair value measurements. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value
measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various
prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS157 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided
the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim
periods, for that fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of FAS 157, but does not expect the adoption ofFAS 157 to have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cashflows.

One of our suppliers
accounted for more than 10% of our inventory purchases in 2006. The loss of
this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce
and sell goods. We do not have a long-term supply agreement with this supplier.
3.Trademarks
In October2006, we acquired the NuHair and Shen
Min brands of hair products from Biotech, International Corporation. The
majority of the assets acquired were the NuHair and Shen Min trademarks for
which we paid approximately $54 million. In accordance with FASB Statement No142
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset, we
have made the judgment that the trademarks/brand names acquired initially have
an indefinite life and as such should not be amortized. Instead the intangible
asset acquired should be tested for impairment annually and the Company will be
performing an impairment during the fourth quarter of each year or at any other
time at which it deems the trademarks may be impaired.
In October 2006, we also
licensed certain trademark and patent rights related to the Promensil and
Trinoven Brands from Novogen Limited Nasdaq:NVGN. Of the amount paid 425,000 was classified as trademarks which, as with the Nu Hair and Shen Min
trademarks, is not being amortized but will be tested for impairment annually. Another
$425,000 of the consideration paid was classified as patents and is being
amortized over the remaining six-year life of the patent rights that were
acquired.
4. Financing
During 1999, we entered into two mortgage notes
payable in the aggregate amount of approximately $8,900,000, collateralized by
our facilities. These notes are payable in monthly installments of
approximately $74,000 in the aggregate, including interest ranging from 775%
to 832%, maturing in 2014 and 2019. As of December31, 2006 the principal
balance of these notes amounted to approximately $67million.
In August2006, we entered into a loan and
security agreement with Wachovia Capital Finance Western, a subsidiary of
Wachovia Bank, N.A. The loan agreement provides for a three-year secured
revolving credit facility of up to $10million. Borrowings under the
facility may be used for ongoing working capital purposes and certain future
acquisitions.
The interest rate on borrowings under the credit
facility is equal to: 1agents publicly announced prime rate for prime
rate loans or 2225% plus the applicable Eurodollar rate for any
Eurodollar rate  51 loans. Interest is payable
monthly in arrears, not later than the first day of each calendar month. Our
interest rate on December31, 2006 was 825%.
The facility is secured by a first priority lien on
all our assets and properties, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations
under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our current and by each
of our future subsidiaries. The credit facility contains certain covenants and
also provides for customary events of default, including non-payment defaults,
covenant defaults and cross-defaults to our other material indebtedness.
At December31, 2006, we had borrowings of
approximately $37 million under this line of credit.

6.Stockholders
Equity
Stock Repurchase Program
In 2000, the Board of
Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for our common stock. Under the
stock repurchase program, we can effect common stock repurchases from time to
time up to an aggregate of $10,000,000. The stock repurchase program does not
have an expiration date. No such repurchases were made in 2006 or 2005.
Stock Options
During 2006, our 1996 Stock Option and Grant Plan
expired. At the annual shareholders meeting in June2006, the shareholders
approved our 2006 Stock Option and Grant plan, the Plan. Under the plan,
the Board of Directors is authorized to grant incentive stock options or
non-qualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to
employees and directors. Non-qualified stock options may be granted to officers
and employees as well as to non-employees. As of December31, 2006, the
number of shares available to be issued under the Plan is 3,292,547 shares. The
plan contains an evergreen provision, which increases the number of shares
available on June30th and December31stof
each year. The number of shares added to the amount of options available equals
15% of the number of shares issued during the prior six months. The maximum
number of shares that may be available at any time is 3,970,500. All options
granted under the Plan have been made at prices not less than the fair market
value of the stock at the date of grant. Generally, the options granted under
the Plan vest over three-to-five years. Options granted under the Plan have a
term of not more than 10years. 53 A

commitments
Consideration for the acquisition of the NuHair and
Shen Min brands includes potential incentive payments based upon the net amount
of invoiced sales of the NuHair and Shen Min products during each of the three
years after the anniversary date of the acquisition of the brands which
occurred in October2006. With respect to Year 1, the Seller will be paid
$100 one dollar for every dollar of net invoiced sales above $76 million. The
potential payment for sales that occur in year one may not exceed $20 million.
During Year 2, the Seller will earn 15% of amount by which net invoiced sales
exceed $114 million. During Year 3, the Seller will earn 15% of the amount by
which net invoiced sales exceed $1368 million.
Consideration for the
acquisition of the U.S. rights to the Promensil and Trinoven brands include a
royalty on net sales revenue that exceeds $20 million. During the first year
after the anniversary of the acquisition, the Seller will earn a royalty equal
to 50% of net sales above $20 million but below $30 million and a royalty
equal to 75% of net sales above $30 million. After the first anniversary
period, the Seller will earn a royalty equal to 2% of net sales above $20 million
but below $30 million and a royalty equal to 30% of net sales above $30
million.
8.Employee
Benefits Plans
We have a profit sharing 401kplan that covers
substantially all of our employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to the
maximum allowed under law. Contributions are discretionary. However, we
generally match 100% of the employees contributions up to the maximum of 10%
of eligible compensation. Amounts recognized as expense were approximately
$30,343, $22,000, and $33,000, for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.
In 1998, the Board of Directors approved the Natrol,Inc.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which allowed substantially all employees
to purchase shares of our common stock, through payroll deductions, at 850% of
the fair market value of the shares at the beginning or end of each of two
annual offering periods, whichever is lower. This plan was cancelled by the
Board of Directors as of the end of the last offering period of 2006. We
expense two thirds of the 150% discount given to employees under the plan. For
the year ended December31, 2006, 22,748 shares were issued at prices
ranging from $152 to $155. For the year ended December31, 2005, 28,533
shares were issued at prices ranging from $136 to $239. For the year ended December31,
2004, 34,419 shares were issued at $233 per share.
In 2006, 2005 and 2004, we
adopted a bonus program for certain employees. The bonuses granted are
dependent upon a formula based on corporate profits before taxes and interest.
We awarded approximately $134,000 in bonus compensation under the 2006 bonus
plan. No bonus payments were issued to employees under the plan in 2005. The
amount of bonus expensed in 2004 relative to this plan was approximately
$600,000. 55 9.Impairment
of Goodwill
In2002, we adopted SFASNo142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill not be
amortized. Beginning in 2002, we have evaluated goodwill for impairment
annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have performed this
evaluation annually, ever since, as of December31 of each year.
During March2004, we settled litigation with the
former owners of Prolab Nutrition,Inc. We received $20million in
cash, which was reflected in the financial statements as a reduction of
goodwill. We determined that this was the proper accounting for the settlement
because the sellers did not deliver a key asset in the condition warranted,
which was a clear and direct link to the purchase price, and accordingly
resulted in a purchase price adjustment reducing goodwill.
We performed an annual
impairment test as of December31 for each of the years presented and
determined that no impairment existed. In all years in which impairment was
tested, we considered a number of variables including, but not limited to, the
market capitalization of the Company, estimates of future earnings and
discounted cash flows, third party assessments of the value of the Company and
transactions involving the purchase and sale of businesses similar to ours.

Item 5. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
Commissions rulesand forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal
financial officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives, and we are required to apply our judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As required by SEC Rule13a-15b, we
carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the year covered by this report. Based
on the foregoing, our principal executive and principal financial officers have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a
reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
