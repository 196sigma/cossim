REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TMP Worldwide Inc.
New York, New York
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMP
Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of Morgan & Banks Limited as of December 31, 1998 and for the years
ended December 31, 1998 and March 31, 1998 which were combined with the
Company financial statements as of December 31, 1998 and for each of the two
years in the period ended December 31, 1998, which financial statements reflect
total assets of approximately $523 million as of December 31, 1998 and total
commissions & fees of approximately $2554 million and $2358 million for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and March 31, 1998, respectively. Those financial
statements were audited by another auditor whose report has been furnished to
us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Morgan &
Banks Limited for the applicable years, is based solely on the report of the
other auditor. We did not audit the financial statements of LAI Worldwide, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of February 28, 1999 and for each of the two years in the
period ended February 28, 1999 which were combined with the Company financial
statements as of December 31, 1998 and for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 1998, which financial statements reflect total assets of
approximately $1038 million as of February 28, 1999 and total commissions &
fees of approximately $618 million and $868 million for each of the two years
in the period ended February 28, 1999, respectively. Those financial statements
were audited by another auditor whose report has been furnished to us, and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for LAI Worldwide, Inc.
and subsidiaries for the applicable years, is based solely on the report of the
other auditor.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the reports of the other auditors provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of TMP Worldwide Inc. and Subsidiaries
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF MORGAN & BANKS LIMITED
SCOPE
We have audited the financial statements of Morgan & Banks Limited for the
financial years ended 31 December 1998 and 31 March 1998. The financial
statements include the consolidated accounts of the economic entity, comprising
the company and the entities it controlled at the year end or from time to
time during the financial year. The company directors are responsible for the
preparation and presentation of these financial statements and the information
they contain. We have conducted an independent audit of the financial statements
and the information they contain in order to express an opinion on them to the
members of the company.
Our audit has been conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing
Standards, which are substantially the same as generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States of America, to provide reasonable assurance as to
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included examination, on a test basis, of evidence supporting the
amounts and other disclosures in the financial statements, and the evaluation of
accounting policies and significant accounting estimates. These procedures have
been undertaken to form an opinion as to whether, in all material respects, the
financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with Australian
Accounting Standards and other mandatory professional reporting requirements and
statutory requirements so as to present a view which is consistent with our
understanding of the company and the economic entity financial position and
the results of its operations and its cash flows.
The audit opinion expressed in this report has been formed on the above
basis.
AUDIT OPINION
In our opinion, the financial statements of Morgan & Banks Limited are
properly drawn up   a so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs as at
31 December 1998, the profit for the financial years ended on
31 December 1998 and 31 March 1998 and the cash flows for the nine month
period ended 31 December 1998, and the year ended 31 March 1998, of the
company and the economic entity   b in accordance with applicable Australian Accounting Standards and other

TMP WORLDWIDE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS
NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
TMP Worldwide Inc. TMP or the Company is the successor to businesses
formerly conducted by TMP Worldwide Inc. and subsidiaries Old TMP, Worldwide
Classified Inc. and subsidiaries WCI, McKelvey Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries MEI and certain other entities under the control of Andrew J.
McKelvey the Principal Stockholder. Immediately prior to the December 1996
reorganization, the Principal Stockholder owned 100% of the common stock of MEI
which owned approximately 86% of the common stock of Old TMP and approximately
33% of the common stock of WCI. In addition to his approximately 33% ownership
of WCI, the Principal Stockholder had voting proxy on the remaining outstanding
shares of WCI.
WCI was organized in 1993 to sell recruitment advertising. On December 9,
1996, Old TMP, which sold yellow page advertising services, merged into MEI.
Thereafter, WCI merged into MEI, MEI then merged into Telephone Marketing
Programs Incorporated and MEI acquired the outstanding minority interest of a
subsidiary the 1996 Mergers. Concurrent with the 1996 Mergers, Telephone
Marketing Programs Incorporated changed its name to TMP Worldwide Inc.
Due to the control of these companies by the Principal Stockholder, the
companies have been consolidated on a retroactive basis in a manner similar to a
pooling of interests, the interests previously owned by the Principal
Stockholder are carried at predecessor basis, and in December 1996 i goodwill
in the amount of approximately $16 million was recorded for the issuance of
542,556 shares of common stock of the Company to Old TMP stockholders who had
been previously issued shares of Old TMP in exchange for their minority
interests in certain operating subsidiaries in which they were original owners
and, accordingly, were considered to have made a substantive investment, and is
based on an initial public offering price of $700 per share, less approximately
$22 million previously recorded on the issuance of these shares, and
ii special compensation in the amount of approximately $520 million was
recorded for the issuance of 7,169,580 shares of common stock of the Company to
Old TMP, WCI and the MEI subsidiary stockholders in exchange for their shares in
those companies which they had received for nominal or no consideration, as
employees or as management of businesses financed substantially by the Principal
Stockholder and, accordingly, were not considered to have made substantive
investments for their minority shares, and is based on an initial public
offering price of $700 per share. The minority stockholders of Old TMP had
received compensation in lieu of their share of earnings of Old TMP in exchange
for waiving their rights to such earnings, and WCI and the MEI subsidiary had
cumulative losses. Accordingly, no amounts were attributable to these minority
interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In addition, in 1996, the Principal Stockholder sold or contributed to the
Company his majority interests, and in one case a 49% interest, in five
companies primarily engaged in yellow page and Internet-based advertising. Due
to the element of common control of these companies, all of these transactions
have been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests and each
of the five companies has been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition by the Principal
Stockholder.
For the period April 1, 1998 through December 31, 1999, the Company
completed 20 mergers which were accounted for as poolings of interests. The
seven that the Company completed prior to April 1, 1999 are Johnson, Smith &
Knisely Inc. JSK, TASA Holding AG TASA, Stackig, Inc. Stackig,
Recruitment Solutions Inc., Sunquest L.L.C. d.b.a. The SMART Group and The

in January 1999: the M Merger. In connection with these mergers, the
Company issued 17,578,910 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding common stock of these seven companies. From April 1, 1999 to
June 30, 1999, the Company completed pooling of interests mergers the Second
Quarter 1999 Mergers with six companies: Interquest Pty. Limited
Interquest, LIDA Advertising Inc. LIDA, Maes & Lunau M, IN2, Inc.
IN2, Lemming & LeVan, Inc. L, and Yellow Pages Unlimited, Inc.
YPU, the Second Quarter 1999 Pooled Companies. In connection with the
Second Quarter 1999 Mergers the Company issued a total of 1,800,480 shares of
TMP common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of the Second
Quarter 1999 Pooled Companies. In addition, from July 1, 1999 through
September 30, 1999, the Company completed pooling of interests mergers the
Third Quarter 1999 Mergers with five companies, Cameron-Newell
Advertising, Inc. CNA, Brook Street Bureau QLD Pty Ltd, Brook St., LAI
Worldwide, Inc. LAI, Fox Advertising Inc. Fox and Lampen Group Limited
Lampen the Third Quarter 1999 Pooled Companies. In connection with the
Third Quarter 1999 Mergers the Company issued a total of 4,306,914 shares of TMP
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of the Third Quarter
1999 Pooled Companies. From October 1, 1999 through December 31, 1999, the
Company completed mergers with two companies, Highland Search Group L.L.C.
Highland and TMC S.r.l. Amrop Italy the Fourth Quarter 1999 Pooled
Companies, which provided for the exchange of all of the outstanding stock of
such companies for a total of 1,517,226 shares of TMP common stock and which
were accounted for as poolings of interests the Fourth Quarter 1999 Mergers.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been retroactively
restated to reflect the effect of the 1996 Mergers, the 1998 Mergers, the M & B
Merger, the Second Quarter 1999 Mergers, the Third Quarter 1999 Mergers and the
Fourth Quarter 1999 Mergers, because such mergers have been accounted for as
poolings of interests see Note 5. As a result, the financial position, results
of operations, and statements of comprehensive income loss and cash flows
included herein are presented as if the combining companies had been
consolidated for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of
stockholders' equity reflect the accounts of TMP as if the additional common
stock issued in connection with these mergers had been issued for all periods
presented.
In addition, the results of Brook St. for the six months ended June 30, 1999
and the results of LAI for the two months ended February 28, 1999 are included
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for both the year ended
December 31, 1998 and the year ended December 31, 1999. Therefore this results
in the inclusion of the following amounts in both periods of a commissions &
fees of $111 million and b a net loss of $38 million or $010 per diluted
share.
NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method when the Company owns at least 20% but no more than 50% of such
affiliates. Under the equity method, the Company records its proportionate share
of profits and losses based on its percentage interest in these affiliates.

NOTE 2--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of commissions & fees and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated
useful lives                                YEARS
Buildings and  5-32
Furniture and  3-10
Capitalized software  3- 5
Computer  3- 7
Transportation  3-18   Leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or
the lives of the related leases, whichever is shorter.
INTANGIBLES
Intangibles represent acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible assets of businesses purchased and consist primarily of the value of
ongoing client relationships and goodwill. These costs are being amortized over
periods ranging from three to thirty years on a straight-line basis.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Long-lived assets, such as ongoing client relationships, goodwill and
property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from
the use of these assets. When any such impairment exists, the related assets
will be written down to fair value. Impairment losses have been recorded as
Merger and Integration Costs See Note 5.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS
The financial position and results of operations of the Company foreign
subsidiaries are determined using local currency as the functional currency.
Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate
in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the
average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are
included in the other comprehensive loss account in stockholders' equity. Gains
and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other
income expense.

COMMISSIONS & FEES RECOGNITION AND WORK-IN-PROCESS
The Company earns fees for the placement of advertisements on the Internet,
primarily its career Web site, Monster.comsm. Such website related fees are
recognized over the length of the advertising agreement, typically one to six
months. The amounts not recognized are reported on the balance sheet as deferred
revenue. The Company also derives commissions & fees for advertisements placed
in telephone directories, newspapers and other media, plus associated fees for
related services. Commissions and fees are generally recognized upon placement
date for newspapers and other media and on publication close date for yellow
page advertisements. The Company also earns fees for executive search and
mid-level selection services. Commissions & fees are recognized as clients are
billed. Billings begin with the client acceptance of a contract. For search, a
retainer equal to 33 1/3% of a candidate first year estimated annual cash
compensation is billed in equal installments over three consecutive months at
which time, in general, the retainer has been substantially earned. A final
invoice is issued in the event that the candidate actual compensation package
exceeds the original estimate. For selection, a fee equal to between 20% and 30%
of a candidate first year estimated annual cash compensation is billed in
equal installments over three consecutive months the average length of time
needed to successfully complete an assignment. Temporary Contracting
commission & fees are recorded when earned.
The amounts charged to clients for Temporary Contracting services are
reported net of the costs of the temporary contractors. The details for such
amounts are in thousands                          YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

The Company quarterly commissions & fees are affected by the cyclical
nature of its operating segments. The timing of yellow page directory closings
is currently concentrated in the third quarter. However, yellow page publishers
may change the timing of directory publications which may have an effect on the
Company quarterly results. The Company Yellow Page Advertising results are
also affected by commissions earned for volume placements for the year, which
are typically reported in the fourth quarter. Amounts reported in the three
months ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 for commissions on volume
placements were $01 million, $09 million and $22 million, respectively. The
Company quarterly commissions & fees for Recruitment Advertising are typically
highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter; however, the
cyclicality in the economy and the Company clients' employment needs have an
overriding impact on the Company quarterly results in recruitment advertising.
Direct operating costs incurred that relate to future commissions & fees,
principally for yellow page advertisements, are deferred recorded as
work-in-process in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are
subsequently charged to expense when the directories are closed for publication
and the related commission is recognized as income.

INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes is computed on the pretax income loss based
on the current tax law. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year-end based on
enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates.
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND CREDIT RISK
The Company operates in five business segments: Interactive, Recruitment
Advertising, Executive Search and Selection, Temporary Contracting and Yellow
Page Advertising. The Company earns fees for advertisements placed on its
Internet websites, commission income for selling and placing recruitment and
yellow page advertising to a large number of customers in many different
industries, fees for executive and mid-level selection services, and
commissions & fees in connection with the providing of temporary contracting
services. The Company operates principally throughout North America, the United
Kingdom, Continental Europe and the Asia Pacific Region.
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk are primarily accounts receivable. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require
collateral. The Company has not experienced significant losses related to
receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular
industry or geographic area.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair
value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments.
The carrying amount reported for long-term debt approximates fair value
because, in general, the interest on the underlying instruments fluctuates with
market rates.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option awards under the intrinsic value
based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Under the
intrinsic value based method, compensation cost is the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the stock at grant date or other measurement date over
the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The Company makes pro
forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
based method of accounting had been applied as required by SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect, in
periods in which they have a dilutive effect, the effect of common shares
issuable upon exercise of stock options and warrants. The Company Board of
Directors authorized

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes in equity except
those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The
Company only item of comprehensive income loss is foreign currency
translation adjustments.
POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employers' Disclosures about
Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, which standardizes the disclosure
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits. The adoption of
SFAS No. 132 in 1998 did not have a material impact on the Company financial
statement disclosures.
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS
The Company capitalizes certain incurred software development costs in
accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA

the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP
98-1. Costs incurred during the application-development stage for software
bought and further customized by outside vendors for the Company use and
software developed by a vendor for the Company proprietary use have been
capitalized. Costs incurred for the Company own personnel who are directly
associated with software development are capitalized. Capitalized software costs

businesses between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1999 including, on
August 26, 1997, all of the outstanding stock of Austin Knight Limited and
subsidiaries Austin Knight for approximately $47,200 net of approximately
$11,500 of cash acquired relating to the sale, in July 1997, of real property by
Austin Knight. The total amount of cash paid and promissory notes and common
stock of the Company issued for these acquisitions was approximately $56,442 30,668 and $74,500 for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The shares of common
stock issued by the Company in connection with certain of the above mentioned
acquisitions were 804,160, 402,812 and 270,056 for 1999, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. These acquisitions have been accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting and accordingly, operations of these businesses have been
included in the consolidated financial statements from their acquisition dates.
On February 27, 1998, LAI completed the acquisition of Ward Howell
International, Inc. WHI. The purchase price was approximately $19,500

The remaining $8,850 of the purchase consideration was payable to the former WHI

balance sheets. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase with goodwill
being recognized for the excess of the purchase amount over the fair market

approximately $1,400 in cash, a $1,250 convertible subordinated note payable and

ACCRUED INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS
In connection with the acquisitions and mergers made in 1997, 1998 and 1999,
the Company formulated plans to integrate the operations of such companies. Such
plans involve the closure of certain offices of the acquired and merged
companies and the termination of certain management and employees. The
objectives of the plans are to eliminate redundant facilities and personnel, and
to create a single brand in the related markets in which the Company operates.
In connection therewith the Company expensed $35,612 in 1999, relating to
integration activities which are included in Merger and integration expenses. In
addition, in 1999 LAI formulated plans to close its London, England and Hong
Kong offices. In connection with these office closings, LAI charged earnings for
the year ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 for $2,789 and $3,543, respectively.

1996 Employee Stock Option Plan the Stock Option Plan, which provides for
the issuance of both incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended the Code, and nonqualified
stock options, to purchase an aggregate of up to 1,800,000 shares amended to
6,000,000 on

NOTE 12--STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY CONTINUED
April 27, 1998 of the common stock of the Company. The Stock Option Plan
permits the granting of options to officers, employees and consultants of the
Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
Under the Stock Option Plan, the exercise price of an incentive stock option
must be at least equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on
the date of grant 110% of the fair market value in the case of options granted
to employees who hold more than ten percent of the voting power of the Company
capital stock on the date of grant. The exercise price of a nonqualified stock
option must be not less than the par value of a share of the common stock on the
date of grant. The term of an incentive or nonqualified stock option is not to
exceed ten years five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to
a ten percent holder. The Stock Option Plan provides that the maximum option
grant which may be made to an executive officer in any calendar year is 90,000
shares amended to 300,000 on June 25, 1997. At December 31, 1999,
approximately 1,806,666 options were exercisable and 1,625,742 options are
available for future grants.
In January 1996, the Company also adopted a stock option plan for
nonemployee directors the Directors' Plan, pursuant to which options to
acquire a maximum aggregate of 360,000 shares of common stock may be granted to
nonemployee directors. Options granted under the Directors' Plan do not qualify
as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The
Directors' Plan provides for an automatic grant to each of the Company
nonemployee directors of an option to purchase 22,500 shares of common stock on
the date of such director initial election or appointment to the Board. The
options will have an exercise price of 100% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant, have a ten-year term and become exercisable
in accordance with a vesting schedule determined by the Board of Directors at
December 31, 1999, approximately 104,740 options were exercisable, and 170,000
options were available for future grants.
In December 1998, the Company also adopted a long-term incentive plan the
1999 Plan, pursuant to which stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock and other equity based awards may be granted. Stock options
which may be granted may be incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
options within the meaning of the Code. The total number of shares of the common
stock of the Company which may be granted under the 1999 Plan is the sum of
30,000,000 and the number of shares available for new awards under the Stock
Option Plan. At December 31, 1999, approximately 1,138,556 options were
exercisable and 17,427,886 options are available for future grants.
The Company applies APB 25 and related Interpretations in accounting for its
employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions;
risk-free interest rates of approximately 61%, 46% and 65% in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively; volatility factor of the expected market price of the
Company common stock of 46%, 24% and 27% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively;
a weighted average expected life of the options of 8 years in 1999, 1998 and
1997; and no dividend yield in 1999, 1998 and 1997.

concluded that, based on expected future results, the future reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences, the tax benefits derived from the
exercise of nonqualified employee stock options, the amortization of benefits
from taxable poolings and the loss carryforwards of certain subsidiaries, which
are only useable by such subsidiary, there is no reasonable assurance that the
entire tax benefit can be used. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been
established. The deferred tax benefits from taxable poolings and the tax
benefits derived from the exercise of nonqualified stock options, net of the
valuation allowance, were recorded as additional paid-in capital.

Provision has not been made for U.S. or additional foreign taxes on

or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. It is not
practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that might be
payable on the foreign earnings; however, the Company believes that foreign tax
credits would substantially offset any U.S. tax. At December 31, 1999, the
cumulative amount of reinvested earnings was approximately $26,000.

Interest is earned on deferred amounts at a rate determined annually by LAI
625% at December 31, 1999.
D LITIGATION
The Company is subject to various claims, suits and complaints arising in
the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of these legal matters
cannot be determined, it is the opinion of management that the final resolution
of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, operations or liquidity.
M & B has had proceedings issued against it in New Zealand for an amount of
$3,400. These proceedings relate to the acquisition of the claimant business
in New Zealand prior to Morgan & Banks New Zealand Limited becoming a controlled
entity of the M & B group. The parties have engaged in significant discovery.
The directors of M & B are of the opinion that the claim is without substance
and, accordingly, the action is being vigorously defended.
E AOL MARKETING AGREEMENT

B In January 1994, the Company acquired a 50% interest in an agency
selling real estate advertising. In connection with this acquisition, the
Company agreed to provide the agency with certain office and administrative
services which amounted to $321 for the nine months ended September 31, 1997 at
which time the arrangement was terminated. The Company also entered into
three-year employment and consulting agreements with the two other stockholders
of the agency and granted them the right to convert their agency shares into
Company shares after an initial public offering. That conversion right, as
amended, provided that those two stockholders may convert 25% of the agency
stock into unregistered common stock of the Company with a total value of $1,000
as of the effective date of conversion. The conversion was exercised in
February 1997 and 123,696 shares of common stock were issued to these
stockholders pursuant to the above agreement. Simultaneously, the Company
transferred to such stockholders 50% of its interest in the agency, thus
retaining a 25% interest and terminated its obligation to provide office and
administrative services effective October 1, 1997.
C The Company leases an office from an entity in which the Principal
Stockholder and other stockholders have a 90% ownership interest. Annual rent
expense under the lease, which expires in the year 2004, amounts to
