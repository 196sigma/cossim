Board of Directors and Stockholders of 8x8, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 8x8, Inc. the Company as of March 31, 2012 and 2011 and
the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 2012. We also have audited the Company internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
management report on internal control over financial reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also include performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of 8x8, Inc. as of March, 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also in our opinion, 8x8, Inc., maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of March 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  s/ Moss Adams LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
THE COMPANY
8x8, Inc. 8x8 or the Company develops and markets telecommunications services for Internet
protocol, or IP, telephony and video applications as well as web-based conferencing and unified communications services. The
Company was incorporated in California in February 1987 and was reincorporated in Delaware in December 1996. 
The Company offers the 8x8 Virtual Office hosted PBX service, 8x8 Virtual Contact Center service, 8x8 Virtual Office Pro unified
communications solution and 8x8 Cloud-Based Computing solutions. Between November 2002 and April 2009, the Company marketed
its services under the Packet8 brand. In May 2009, the Company began marketing its services under the 8x8 brand. As of March 31,
2012, the Company had more than 28,500 business customers. Each business customer subscribes to a number of various lines and
services e.g. physical phone extensions, contact center seats, virtual extensions, fax lines, toll free numbers, receptionist
software, unified communications services, etc.
The Company fiscal year ends on March 31 of each calendar year. Each reference to a fiscal year in these notes to the
consolidated financial statements refers to the fiscal year ended March 31 of the calendar year indicated for example, fiscal 2012
refers to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.
RECLASSIFICATION
Certain amounts previously reported within the Company consolidated statements of income have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification includes Reclassifying expenses related to the Company sales, customer service and marketing activities, which were previously included
in sales, general and administrative expenses, to sales and marketing.
The reclassification had no impact on the Company previously reported income from continuing operations, net income or basic
or diluted income per share amounts.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 8x8 and its subsidiaries. All material
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and
equity and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, but not limited to, those
related to bad debts, returns reserve for expected cancellations, valuation of inventories, income and sales tax, and litigation and other
contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
VoIP service and product revenue
The Company VoIP service and product revenue is derived from the sale of IP business telephones and VoIP service. 
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC
605-25 requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement
44 meet specific criteria. In addition, arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of
accounting based on their relative fair values, with certain limitations. The provisioning of the 8x8 service with the accompanying 8x8 IP
telephone constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 605-25, the
Company allocates 8x8 revenues, including activation fees, among the 8x8 IP telephones and subscriber services. Revenues allocated
to these devices are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the
30-day trial period. All other revenues are recognized as license and service revenues when the related services are provided. The
Company records revenue net of any sales-related taxes that are billed to its customers. The Company believes this approach results
in financial statements that are more easily understood by users.
Under the terms of the Company typical subscription agreement, new customers can terminate their service
within 30 days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid. The Company has determined that it has sufficient
history of subscriber conduct to make a reasonable estimate of cancellations within the 30-day trial period. Therefore, the Company
recognizes new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped, net of an allowance for expected
cancellations.
Deferred cost of goods sold represents the cost of products sold for which the end customer or distributor has a right of return. The
cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue, when the subscriber has accepted the
service.
Product revenue
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales for which there are no related services to be rendered upon shipment to
partners and end users provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of
resulting receivables is reasonably assured, there are no customer acceptance requirements, and there are no remaining significant
obligations. Gross outbound shipping and handling charges are recorded as revenue, and the related costs are included in cost of
goods sold. Reserves for returns and allowances for partner and end user sales
are recorded at the time of shipment. In accordance with the ASC 985-605, the Company records shipments to distributors, retailers,
and resellers, where the right of return exists, as deferred revenue. The Company defers recognition of revenue on sales to
distributors, retailers, and resellers until products are resold to the end user. 
License and related revenue
During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, revenues from software and technology licensing and related arrangements were limited.
The Company recognizes revenue from license contracts when a non-cancelable, non-contingent license agreement has been signed,
the software product has been delivered, no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance exist, fees from the agreement are fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. The Company uses the relative selling price method to recognize revenue when a license
agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the relative selling price of all undelivered
elements exists. The relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionately to each deliverable on the
basis of each deliverable selling price. If evidence of the relative selling price of the undelivered elements does not exist, revenue is
deferred and recognized when delivery occurs. When the Company enters into a license agreement requiring that the Company provide
significant customization of the software products, the license and consulting revenue is recognized using contract accounting.
Revenue from maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, which in most instances is
one year. The Company recognizes royalties upon notification of sale by its licensees. Revenue from consulting, training, and
development services is recognized as the services are performed. 
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Management determines the appropriate categorization of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the
classification at each reporting date. The cost of the Company investments is determined based upon specific identification. 
The Company investments are comprised of money market and mutual funds. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, all investments were
classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, based upon quoted market prices, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
related tax, if any, included in other comprehensive loss and disclosed as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized
gains and losses on sales of all such investments are reported within the caption of other income, net in the consolidated statements of
operations and computed using the specific identification method. The Company investments in marketable securities are monitored
on a periodic basis for impairment. In the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established.              45 Available-for-sale investments are presented as short-term investments in the balance sheet and were in thousands: Gross Amortized Unrealized Estimated As of March 31, 2012 Costs Loss Fair Value Mutual Funds    2,000      58    1,942 Total available-for-sale investments    2,000      58    1,942 Included in in thousands   Short-term investments    1,942     Total    1,942  Gross Amortized Unrealized Estimated As of March 31, 2011 Costs Loss Fair Value Mutual Funds    2,000      73    1,927 Total available-for-sale investments    2,000      73    1,927 Included in in thousands   Short-term investments    1,927     Total    1,927 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALLOWANCE
The Company estimates the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period based on the
aging of the receivable balance, current and historical customer trends, and communications with its customers. Amounts are
written off only after considerable collection efforts have been made and the amounts are determined to be uncollectible. The allowance
for doubtful accounts was $140,000 and $21,000 at March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates actual cost using the first-in, first-out method, or
market. Any write-down of inventory to the lower of cost or market at the close of a fiscal period creates a new cost basis that
subsequently would not be marked up based on changes in underlying facts and circumstances. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates inventory for obsolescence and slow-moving items. This evaluation includes analysis of sales levels, sales projections, and
purchases by item, as well as raw material usage related to the Company manufacturing facilities. If the Company review indicates a
reduction in utility below carrying value, it reduces inventory to a new cost basis. If future demand or market conditions are different
than the Company current estimates, an inventory adjustment may be required, and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the
period the revision is made. Inventory was comprised of the following March 31 2012 2011 in thousands   Work-in-process       55    1,510   Finished goods      526      595      581    2,105             46 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization
are computed using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives of three years are used for equipment and software and five years
for furniture and fixtures. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the shorter of the remaining facility lease term or
the estimated useful life of the improvements. Property and equipment was comprised of the following March 31 2012 2011 in thousands   Machinery and computer equipment    8,211    5,817   Furniture and fixtures      252      251   Licensed software    1,992    1,915   Construction in process       90          Leasehold improvements      263      262   10,808    8,245 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization   6,988   5,847    3,820    2,398 Maintenance, repairs and ordinary replacements are charged to expense. Expenditures for improvements that extend the physical
or economic life of the property are capitalized. Gains or losses on the disposition of property and equipment are recorded in the loss
from operations. 
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Goodwill represents the excess fair value of
consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. The carrying value of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are annually tested for impairment and more often if there is an indicator of
impairment. 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited. The Company reviews the
recoverability of its long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or
asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on the Company ability to recover the carrying
value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related
operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference
between estimated fair value and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows
and the fair value of long-lived assets. 
Amortization expense for the customer relationship intangible asset is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Amortization expense for technology is included in cost of service revenue. The carrying values of intangible assets were as follows in
thousands: March 31, 2012 March 31, 2011 Gross Gross Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Carrying Accumulated Net Carrying Amount Amortization Amount Amount Amortization Amount Technology    8,242     432    7,810                       Customer relationships    3,305     450    2,855      308      94      214 Trade names/domains      957             957                       Total acquired identifiable   intangible assets   12,504     882   11,622      308      94      214             47 At March 31, 2012, annual amortization of intangible assets, based upon our existing intangible assets and current useful lives, is
estimated to be the following in thousands: Amount 2013    1,428 2014    1,334 2015    1,325 2016    1,325 2017    1,318   Thereafter    3,935   Total   10,665 WARRANTY EXPENSE
The Company accrues for estimated product warranty cost upon revenue recognition. Accruals for product warranties are
calculated based on the Company historical warranty experience adjusted for any specific requirements.
WARRANT LIABILITY
The Company accounts for its warrants in accordance with ASC 480-10 which requires warrants to be classified as
permanent equity, temporary equity or as assets or liabilities. The Company previously had two outstanding warrants that were
classified as liabilities. Both of these warrants expired on December 19, 2010.
RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE COSTS
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Software development costs for software to be
sold or otherwise marketed incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development and
are expensed as incurred. The Company defines establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model.
Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market
availability of the product are capitalized, if material. To date, all software development costs for software to be sold or otherwise
marketed have been expensed as incurred.  In accordance with ASC 350-40, the Company capitalizes purchase and implementation
costs of internal use software. No such costs were capitalized during the periods presented.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $66 million, $59 million and $50 million for the years ended March
31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
SUBSCRIBER ACQUISITION COSTS
Subscriber acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and include the advertising, marketing, promotions, commissions,
rebates and equipment subsidy costs associated with the Company efforts to acquire new subscribers.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach. Under the asset and liability approach, a current tax
liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. A deferred tax liability or
asset is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards. If necessary, the deferred
tax assets are reduced by the amount of benefits that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not expected to be realized.             48 CONCENTRATIONS
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
cash and cash equivalents, investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company has cash equivalents and investment policies
that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and restrict placement of these funds to financial institutions
evaluated as highly credit-worthy. The Company has not experienced any material losses relating to its investment instruments. 
The Company sells its products to consumers and distributors. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and generally does not require collateral from its customers. For the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2010, the
Company wrote-off accounts receivables for approximately $02 million and $03 million, respectively. For the year ended March 31,
2011, the Company experienced minimal write-offs for bad debts and doubtful accounts. At March 31, 2012 and 2011, no customer
accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable. 
The Company outsources the manufacturing of its hardware products to independent contract manufacturers. The inability of any
contract manufacturer to fulfill supply requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results, financial position or
cash flows. If any of these contract manufacturers fail to perform on their obligations to the Company, such failure to fulfill supply
requirements of the Company could materially impact future operating results, financial position and cash flows.
The Company also relies primarily on third party network service providers to provide telephone numbers and PSTN call
termination and origination services for its customers. If these service providers failed to perform their obligations to the Company,
such failure could materially impact future operating results, financial position and cash flows.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair value of financial instruments is determined by the Company using available market information and
valuation methodologies considered to be appropriate. The carrying amounts of the Company cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The Company investments are carried at
fair values.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its employee stock options and stock purchase rights granted under the
1996 Stock Plan, 1996 Director Option Plan, 1999 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, the 2006 Stock Plan, the 2003 Contactual Plan
and stock purchase rights under the 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan collectively Equity Compensation Plans
under the provisions of ASC 718 - Stock Compensation. Under the provisions of ASC 718, share-based compensation cost is
measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee
requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant, net of estimated forfeitures. 
To value option grants and stock purchase rights under the Equity Compensation Plans for stock-based
compensation the Company used the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility, expected life, risk free interest rates and
future dividend payments. For fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company used the historical volatility of the Company stock
over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value. The expected life assumptions represent the weighted-average
period stock-based awards are expecting to remain outstanding. These expected life assumptions are established through the review of
historical exercise behavior of stock-based award grants with similar vesting periods. The risk free interest is based on the closing
market bid yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities in the over-the-counter market for the expected term equal to the expected
term of the option. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company history and expectation of future dividend payout.
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, was
measured based on ASC 718 criteria. Compensation expense for all share-based payment awards are recognized using the straight-line
single-option method and includes the impact of estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of
grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from non-owner sources.
The difference between net income and comprehensive income is due to unrealized gains or losses on investments classified as
available-for-sale. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.  
NET INCOME PER SHARE 
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders numerator by the
weighted average number of vested, unrestricted common shares outstanding during the period denominator. Diluted net income per
share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options and employee restricted purchase rights.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
Under ASU 2011-04, the guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements to
ensure that fair value has the same meaning in U.S. GAAP and in IFRSs and that their respective fair value measurement and
disclosure requirements are the same. ASU 2011-04 is effective for public entities during interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2011. The Company is planning to adopt ASU 2011-04 in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and does not believe that the
adoption of ASU 2011-04 will have a material impact on the Company consolidated results of operation and financial condition. 
In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income ASC Topic 220: Presentation of Comprehensive
Income, ASU 2011-05 which amends current comprehensive income guidance. This accounting update eliminates the option to
present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders' equity. Instead, we must report
comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections, net income and
other comprehensive income, or in two separate but consecutive statements. ASU 2011-05 will be effective for public companies during
the interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The Company is planning to adopt
ASU 2011-05 in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013 and does not believe that the adoption of ASU 2011-05 will have a material impact
on the Company consolidated results of operation and financial condition. 
In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for
Impairment, ASU 2011-08 which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment. This accounting update permits an entity to
first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step good will impairment test described in Topic 350. The
more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. ASU 2011-08 will be effective for annual and
interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 with early adoption permitted. The
adoption of ASU 2011-08 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated results of operation and financial condition.
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income Topic 220 - Deferral of the Effective Date for
Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting
Standards Update No. 2011-05 ASU 2011-12. ASU 2011-12 defers changes in Update 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of
reclassification adjustments. ASU 2011-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December
15, 2011. The Company is planning to adopt ASU 2011-12 in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013 and does not believe that the adoption
of ASU 2011-12 will have a material impact on the Company consolidated results of operation and financial condition. 
2. INCOME TAXES
For the year ended March 31, 2012, the Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $624 million which was primarily
attributable to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance related to the Company deferred tax assets. For the years ended
March 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $55,000, and $3,000, respectively, which was
attributable to state tax in several states and foreign tax, offset by federal refund in lieu of bonus depreciation in accordance with the
Economic Stimulus Act of 2010. The components of the consolidated provision for income taxes for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010
consisted of the following in thousands: 
51 March 31 Current 2012 2011 2010   Federal                     77   State       76       53       70   Foreign       8        2       10       68       55        3 Deferred   Federal  56,665                  State   5,757                  Foreign                           Total deferred tax benefit  62,422                  Income tax provision benefit  62,354       55        3 The Company income before income taxes included $0, $3,000 and $38,000 of foreign subsidiary income for
the fiscal years ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Deferred tax assets were comprised of the following in thousands: March 31 Current deferred tax assets 2012 2011   Net operating loss carryforwards    6,518          Inventory valuation       45      133   Reserves and allowances    1,167    1,392     Net current deferred tax assets    7,730    1,525 Net operating loss carryforwards   54,783   57,484 Research and development and other credit carryforwards    2,436    2,196 Fixed assets and intangibles   1,172    4,279     Net non-current deferred tax assets   56,047   63,959 Valuation allowance   2,070  65,484        Total   61,707        As required, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets. To assess the likelihood that the deferred tax
assets will be recovered from taxable income, the Company considered both positive evidence that indicates a valuation allowance is
not needed and negative evidence that indicates a valuation allowance is needed. At March 31, 2012, the Company considered its
recent history of three consecutive years profitability and anticipated profit in future periods, and as a result of these and other factors, it
released the valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets of approximately $621 million as it believes that it is more
likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future.
At March 31, 2012, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax
purposes of approximately $1688 million and $1055 million, respectively, which expire at various dates beginning in 2013 and
continuing through 2032. The net operating loss carryforwards include approximately $73 million resulting from employee exercises of
non-qualified stock options or disqualifying dispositions, the tax benefits of which, when realized, will be accounted for as an addition to
additional paid-in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for income taxes. In addition, at March 31, 2012, the Company had
research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately $18 million and $32
million, respectively. The federal credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2021 and continuing through 2032, while
the California credits will carry forward indefinitely. A reconciliation of the tax provision to the amounts computed using the statutory
U.S. federal income tax rate of 34% is as follows in thousands: 
52 Years Ended March 31 2012 2011 2010 Tax provision at statutory rate    2,337    2,226    1,320 State income taxes before valuation allowance   net of federal effect      408      372      298 Research and development credits     211     128     112 Change in valuation allowance  65,042   2,147   1,536 Income loss from change in fair value of warrant liability             57       50 Compensation/option differences      87     291      20 Non-deductible compensation      220       75       51 Other    21        5      48  62,354       55        3 The Company recognizes the tax benefit from
uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on
the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows
in thousands Unrecognized Tax Benefits 2012 2011 2010 Balance at beginning of year    1,726    1,743    2,206 Gross increases - tax position in prior period      111                Gross decreases - tax position in prior period            157     586 Gross increases - tax positions related to the current year      646      140      123 Settlements                       Lapse of statue of limitations                       Balance at end of year    2,483    1,726    1,743 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $25 million, but any
effect would have been fully offset by the application of the valuation allowance. To the extent that the unrecognized tax benefits are
ultimately recognized, they may have an impact on the effective tax rate in future periods; however, such impact on the effective tax
rate would only occur if the recognition of such unrecognized tax benefits occurs in a future period when the Company has already
determined that its deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable. The Company does not expect the unrecognized tax
benefits to change significantly over the next 12 months.
The Company files U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations.  The
Company has not been under examination by income tax authorities in federal, state or other foreign jurisdictions. The 1995 through
fiscal 2012 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities. In significant foreign
jurisdictions, the fiscal year 2009 and 2010 tax years remain subject to examination by their respective tax authorities. 
The Company policy for recording interest and penalties associated with audits is to record such items as a component of
operating expense income before taxes. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, the Company did not recognize
any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. 
Undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. No provision has
been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings, nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this
liability. 
The Company has performed an analysis of its changes in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended the Code, and hasdetermined that any ownership changes which have occurred do not result in a
permanent limitation on usage of the Company federal and state net operating losses.
53 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal market or the most advantageous market in
which it would transact.
The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market
participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of
the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company assumptions about the factors that market participants would
use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used
to measure fair value by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. A financial instrument categorization within
the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy
is as follows Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for
which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the
measurement date.
Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for
which there are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets.
Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for
which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including the Company
own assumptions. The following table presents the Company fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
at March 31, 2012 and 2011 in thousands Quoted Prices in Active Markets Other Significant for Identical Observable Unobservable Assets Inputs Inputs Balance at Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 3/31/2012 Cash equivalents  Money market funds   14,366                  14,366 Short-term investments  Mutual funds 1            1,942            1,942 Total   14,366    1,942           16,308             54 Quoted Prices in Active Markets Other Significant for Identical Observable Unobservable Assets Inputs Inputs Balance at Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 3/31/2011 Cash equivalents  Money market funds   14,358                  14,358 Short-term investments  Mutual funds 1            1,927            1,927 Total   14,358    1,927           16,285 1 The fair value of mutual funds is determined based on published net asset values. The Company uses such pricing data as
the primary input to make its assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of its investment portfolio. 4. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Guarantees
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, the Company may agree to indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors and parties
to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters such as breaches of representations or covenants or intellectual
property infringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim
can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and
directors.
It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of the Company exposure under these indemnification
agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular
agreement. Historically, payments made by the Company under these agreements have not had a material impact on the Company
operating results, financial position or cash flows. Under some of these agreements, however, the Company potential indemnification
liability might not have a contractual limit.

The Company, from time to time, is involved in various legal claims or litigation, including patent
infringement claims that can arise in the normal course of the Company operations. Pending or future litigation could be costly, could
cause the diversion of management attention and could upon resolution, have a material adverse effect on the Company business,
results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
On October 6, 2010, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit, Ceres Communications
Technologies, LLC Ceres v. 8x8, Inc. et al., along with over a dozen other defendants, in the United States District
Court for the District of Delaware. On November 16, 2010, the Company agreed to represent and indemnify OfficeMax in this lawsuit for
the period in which its prior retail agreement with them was in effect, in accordance with the terms of that agreement. On June 8, 2011,
the Ceres suit against the Company and OfficeMax was settled after the Company acquired license rights for the subject patent from a
licensor of third party intellectual property.
On March 15, 2011, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit, Bear Creek Technologies,
Inc. v. 8x8, Inc. et al., along with more than 20 other defendants. On August 17, 2011, the Company was dismissed without
prejudice from this lawsuit under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On August 17, 2011, the Company was sued again
by Bear Creek Technologies, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The Company filed a motion to dismiss
the complaint on October 11, 2011, which motion is still pending. The Company has not answered the complaint. The Company
believes it has factual and legal defenses to these claims and are presenting a vigorous defense. The Company cannot estimate
potential liability in this case at this early stage of litigation. Further, on April 26, 2011, the U.S. Patent Trademark Office initiated
a Reexamination proceeding with a Reexamination Declaration explaining that there is a substantial new question of patentability
affecting each claim of the patent which is the basis for the complaint against the Company.
On October 25, 2011, the Company was named a defendant in a lawsuit, Klausner Technologies, Inc. v. Oracle Corporation et
al., along with 30 other defendants. On November 1, 2011, Klausner dismissed the Complaint voluntarily and filed new complaints
separating the defendants, including a new Complaint against 8x8. The Company believes it has factual and legal defenses to these
claims and is presenting a vigorous defense. The plaintiff has not made a specific monetary demand and the Company cannot estimate
potential liability in this case at this early stage of litigation. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on February 23, 2012,
and the motion is still pending. The Company has not answered the complaint.
State and Municipal Taxes 
From time to time, the Company has received inquiries from a number of state and municipal taxing agencies with respect to
the remittance of taxes. Three states currently are conducting tax audits of the Company records. The Company collects or has
accrued for taxes that it believes are required to be remitted. The amounts that have been remitted have historically been within the
accruals established by the Company. 
57 Regulatory
VoIP communication services, like the Company, are subject to less regulation at the federal level than traditional
telecommunication services and states are preempted from regulating such services. Many regulatory actions are underway or are
being contemplated by federal and state authorities, including the FCC, and state regulatory agencies. The FCC initiated a notice of
public rule-making in early 2004 to gather public comment on the appropriate regulatory environment for IP telephony which would
include the services we offer. In November 2004, the FCC ruled that the VoIP service of a competitor and similar services are
jurisdictionally interstate and not subject to state certification, tariffing and other legacy telecommunication carrier regulations.  
The effect of any future laws, regulations and the orders on the Company operations, including, but not limited to, the 8x8 service,
cannot be determined. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases the
Company costs of providing service that may or may not be recoverable from the Company customers which could result in making
the Company services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if the Company increases its retail prices or
decreases the Company profit margins if it attempts to absorb such costs.

On September 15, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Contactual, Inc.
Contactual, a provider of cloud-based call center and customer interaction management solutions, pursuant to the terms of a merger
agreement between the Company and Contactual. The Company issued a total of 6,484,900 shares of common stock as acquisition
consideration. This figure reflects a 215,100 share reduction related to 8x8 agreement to pay statutory tax withholding on behalf of five
former Contactual executives under the terms of the merger agreement. Approximately 1,005,000 of the shares of common stock
issued as acquisition consideration are being held in escrow as security for the indemnification obligations of the Contactual
stockholders under the merger agreement. The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following in
thousands Cash          892 Fair value of shares of stock issued       30,608 Fair value of options          274   Total purchase price       31,774 The Company recorded the acquisition of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their
estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to the operating synergies expected to be
realized through the acquisition of Contactual and the workforce of the acquired business. The fair value assigned to identifiable
intangible assets acquired was based on estimates and assumptions made by management. Intangible assets will be amortized on a
straight-line basis.

was available as of the acquisition date. The Company believes that information that was available as of the acquisition date provides a
reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations for the
Company and Contactual as if the merger occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The pro forma financial
information for all periods presented also includes the business combination accounting effects resulting from this acquisition including
the acquisition costs of $05 million and amortization charges from acquired intangible assets. The pro forma financial information as
presented below is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the
acquisition had taken place at the beginning of each reporting period presented. 
The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended March 31, 2012 combined the historical results of the Company
for the year ended March 31, 2012, the historical results of Contactual for the six months ended June 30, 2011, and the effects of the
pro forma adjustments described above. 
65 The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended March 31, 2011 combined the historical results of the Company
for the year ended March 31, 2011, the historical results of Contactual for the year ended December 31, 2010 and the effects of the pro
forma adjustments described above Fiscal Year Ended March 31 2012 2011 In thousands, except per share data Pro forma net revenue          89,693   77,589 Pro forma net income          68,689    3,310 Pro forma net income per share basic            105     005 Pro forma net income per share diluted            100     005 There is no impact to the Company tax provision for the year ended March 31, 2012 and 2011 from the pro forma adjustments
since the Contactual had tax losses and the Company had a 100% valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in those periods. 
As the Company has begun to integrate the combined operations, eliminating overlapping processes and expenses and integrating
its products and sales efforts with those of Contactual, it is impractical to determine the revenues and earnings specific to Contactual
since the acquisition date. 
Central Host, Inc.
On May 1, 2010, the Company entered into an agreement with Central Host pursuant to which the Company acquired this
provider of managed hosting services from its sole shareholder. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $1,000,000 in
cash and issued 432,276 shares of 8x8 common stock, at an average price of $1388 per share, to the sole shareholder in exchange
for all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Central Host. 
The estimated fair value of the consideration transferred consisted of the following in thousands: Cash    1,000 Fair value of stock issued      600   Total acquisition costs    1,600 The Company recorded the acquisition of tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities
assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the consideration transferred over the aggregate fair values of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on
estimates and assumptions made by management.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT
In April 2010, the Company invested $250,000 cash, transferred its wholly-owned French research and development
subsidiary, 8x8 Europe SARL, and granted a non-exclusive license to certain 8x8 technology, to Stonyfish, a privately-held company in
Los Altos, California in exchange for a 17% interest in Stonyfish following its initial round of external fundraising. 
The total investment in Stonyfish is as follows in thousands Cash - 8x8, Inc.      250 Cash - 8x8 Europe SARL       65 Net tangible assets - 8x8 Europe SARL       41   Total investment      356 In February 2012, the Company reviewed the recoverability of its strategic investment due to a change in
circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As the change in circumstance was deemed
to be other-than-temporary, the Company has recorded an impairment charge and written the investment down to its fair value of
$0.             67 8X8, INC.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in the Company internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act during the most
recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over
financial reporting. 
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act, as
of March 31, 2012. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of March
31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Rules13a-15f or 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness
of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31, 2012. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Moss Adams LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting which appears in Item 8 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
