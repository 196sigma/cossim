INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Pegasystems Inc.:  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pegasystems Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pegasystems Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  Boston, Massachusetts February 16, 2004

PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Business  We develop, market, license and support software that enables transaction
intensive organizations to manage a broad array of business processes. We also offer consulting, training and maintenance support services to facilitate the installation and use of our products.  b Management estimates and reporting  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant assets and liabilities with reported amounts based on estimates include trade and
installment accounts receivable, long term license installments, deferred income taxes and deferred revenue.  c Principles of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pegasystems Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Pegasystems Limited a United Kingdom
company, Pegasystems Company a Canadian company, Pegasystems Worldwide Inc. a United States corporation, Pegasystems Pty Ltd. an Australian company, Pegasystems Investment Inc. a United States corporation and Pegasystems Private Limited a
Singapore company. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain amounts in the 2002 consolidated financial statements were reclassified to be consistent with the current presentation.  d Foreign currency translation  The translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries is
made at period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the period transactions occurred. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Realized and unrealized exchange gains or losses from transactions and adjustments are reflected in other income expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.  e Revenue recognition  Our revenue is derived from two primary sources: software license fees and
service fees. We offer both perpetual and term software licenses. Perpetual license fees are generally payable at the time the software is delivered, and are generally recognized as revenue when the software is delivered, any acceptance required by
contract is obtained, and no significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software, other than maintenance support. Payments subject to refund are recognized in revenue as refund provisions lapse.  Term software license fees are generally payable on a monthly basis under
license agreements that generally have a five-year term and may be renewed for additional years at the customers option. The present value of future license payments is generally recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance, provided that no
significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software, other than maintenance support. A portion of the license fees payable under each term license agreement equal to the difference between the total license payments and the
discounted present value of those payments is initially deferred and recognized as installment receivable interest income and is not part of total revenue over the license term. Many of our license 
34 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
agreements provide for license fee increases based on inflation. When such an increase occurs, as determined by the terms of the license agreement, we
recognize the present value of such increases as revenue; the remainder of the increase is recognized as installment receivable interest income over the remaining license term. For purposes of the present value calculations, the discount rates used
are estimates of customers borrowing rates at the time of recognition, typically below prime rate, and have varied between 325% and 80% for the past few years. As a result, revenue that we recognize relative to these types of license
arrangements would be impacted by changes in market interest rates. For term license agreement renewals, license revenue is recognized with the same present value approach, when the customer becomes committed to the new license terms and no
significant obligations or contingencies exist related to the software, other than maintenance support.  In certain circumstances, such as when license fees are not fixed or determinable, some term licenses are accounted for on a subscription basis, where
revenue is recognized as payments become due over the term of the license.  Our services revenue is comprised of fees for software implementation, consulting, maintenance and training services. Our software implementation and consulting agreements typically require us to provide services for
a fixed fee or at an hourly rate. Revenues for time and material projects are recognized as fees are billed. Until the fair value of the elements of a contract can be determined, the recognition of services revenue for fixed-price projects is
limited to amounts equal to direct costs incurred, resulting in no gross profit. We do not have a reliable track record for accurately estimating the time and resources needed to complete fixed-price service projects. As a result, determination of
the fair values of the elements of the contract has generally occurred late in the implementation process, typically when implementation is complete and remaining services are no longer significant to the project. If the fair values of the elements
of a contract are then apparent, the remaining revenue and profit associated with the fixed-price services elements will be recognized when the project is completed. To the extent that a software license is included in the contract, any residual
amounts remaining after revenue is allocated to the services elements are recorded as license revenues. All costs of services are expensed as incurred.  Software license customers are offered the option to enter into a maintenance contract, which usually requires the customer to pay a monthly maintenance
fee over the term of the maintenance agreement, typically renewable annually. Prepaid maintenance fees are deferred and are recognized evenly over the term of the maintenance agreement. We generally recognize training fees revenue as the services
are provided.  We reduce revenue for estimates of the fair
values of potential concessions, such as disputed services, when revenue is initially recorded. These estimated amounts are deferred or reserved until the related elements of the agreement are completed and provided to the customer or the dispute is
resolved.  Our agreements with customers generally require us
to indemnify the customer against claims that our software infringes third party patent, copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights. Such indemnification obligations are generally limited in a variety of industry-standard respects, including
our right to replace an infringing product. As of December 31, 2003, we had not experienced any material losses related to these indemnification obligations and no material claims with respect thereto were outstanding. We do not expect significant
claims related to these indemnification obligations, and consequently, we have not established any related reserves.

Investments U.S. government and agency securities-held to maturity 6,053 8 6,045  We consider debt
securities with remaining maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest is recorded when earned. Securities that we have the ability and
intent to hold until maturity are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. There have been no reclassifications between
investment categories. As of December 31, 2003, remaining maturities of marketable debt securities ranged from February 2004 to December 2005. As of December 31, 2002, remaining maturities of marketable debt securities ranged from January 2003 to
January 2004. During 2003, $08 million of investments held at December 31, 2002 were called by their issuer earlier than their stated maturity date. We hold $12 million of restricted cash, invested in money market funds, as collateral for a letter
of credit in accordance with an office lease arrangement. As of December 31, 2003, this balance was classified as a cash equivalent.  g Concentration of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of short-term cash investments, trade accounts receivable and
license installments receivable. We record long-term license installments in accordance with our revenue recognition policy, which results in long-term installment receivables from customers due in periods exceeding one year from the reporting
date, primarily from large organizations with strong credit ratings. We grant credit to customers who are located throughout the world. We perform credit evaluations of customers and generally do not request collateral from customers. Amounts due
under long-term license installments are as follows:  LicenseInstallments in thousands For the calendar year 2004 28,565 2005 25,034 2006 19,745 2007 10,740 2008 3,122 2009 and thereafter 578 87,784 Deferred license interest income 5,553 Total license installments receivable, net 82,231

h Equipment and improvements, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization
Equipment and improvements are recorded at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are three years for equipment and five years for furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
lesser of the life of the lease or the useful life of the asset. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.  i Impairment of long-lived assets  We evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Impairment is generally assessed by comparison of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to its carrying value, with the exception that goodwill impairment is assessed by use of a fair value model. If such assets
are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. There were no impairments in 2003, 2002, and 2001.  j Research and development and software costs  Research and development costs, other than certain software related costs,
are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of software costs begins upon the establishment of technical feasibility, generally demonstrated by a working model or an operative version of the computer software product. Such costs have not been material
to date and, as a result, no internal costs were capitalized during 2003, 2002, and 2001.  Amortization of capitalized software is included in the cost of software license. No amortization expense for internally developed capitalized software costs was charged to cost of software license during 2003, 2002,
and 2001.  k Earnings per share  Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes, to the extent inclusion of such shares would be dilutive to earnings per share, the effect of outstanding options and warrants, computed using the treasury stock
method.  in thousands, except per share data

accounted for approximately 15% and 12% of our total revenue, respectively. In 2002 and 2001, one customer accounted for approximately 26% and 14% of our total revenue, respectively. At December 31, 2003, one customer represented 49% of outstanding
trade accounts receivable and one customer represented 16% of long and short-term license installments. At December 31, 2002, one customer represented 22% of outstanding trade accounts receivable and one customer represented 12% of long and
short-term license installments.  m Stock options
We periodically grant stock options for a fixed
number of shares to employees, directors and non-employee contractors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant. We account for stock option grants to employees and directors using the intrinsic
value method and intend to continue to do so. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation associated with stock awards to employees and directors is determined as the difference, if any, between the current fair value of the underlying common
stock on the date compensation is measured and the price the employee or director must pay to exercise the award. The measurement date for employee awards is generally the date of grant.  At December 31, 2003, we had three stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 4. No
stock-based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income in 2003 and 2002, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Approximately $01
million of stock-based compensation is reflected in net income in 2001. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation, to stock-based employee compensation.  in thousands, except per share amounts

The fair value of options at the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  2003 2002 2001 Volatility
71 77 100 Expected option life Years from grant
N/A N/A 50 Years from vesting
10 10 N/A Interest rate risk free
256 278 440 Dividends
None None None
For awards granted
prior to 2002, a Black-Scholes single-option model using an expected option life from the grant date was used to value grants. For awards in 2002 and subsequent years, a Black-Scholes multiple-option model using an expected option life from the
vesting date was used to reflect changes in grant and exercise patterns.  For the portion of pro forma compensation expense disclosed above relating to the Stock Purchase Plan, the weighted average fair values of the options feature implicit in our Purchase Plan offerings in 2003, 2002, and
2001 were $182, $236, and $174, respectively.  The
effects on 2003, 2002, and 2001 pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share of the estimated fair value of stock options and shares are not necessarily representative of the effects on the results of operations in the future. In
addition, the estimates made utilize a pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives; our option grants typically have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable. Therefore, the actual fair value of a stock option
grant may be different from our estimates. We believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non-traded stock options.  n Fair value of financial instruments  The principal financial instruments held consist of cash equivalents,
investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable, capital lease obligations, and license installment receivables arising from license transactions. The carrying values of cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to the relatively short-term nature of the accounts. Using current market rates, the fair value of license installment receivables approximates carrying value at December 31, 2003 and 2002.  o Acquired technology and goodwill  Intangible assets are recorded at cost and principally represent technology
acquired in business combinations or from third parties. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful lives. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, intangible assets consisted of technology acquired in a
business combination with a carrying value of $07 million and $11 million and accumulated amortization of $07 million and $03 million, respectively. Amortization expense for this acquired technology was $04 million and $03 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Total amortization expense was $04 million, $27 million, and $30 million in 2001, including amortization of FDRs ESP software and warrant as described in Note 5.  We expect to recognize approximately $04 million of annual amortization
expense related to those assets yearly until January 2006.  Goodwill represents the residual purchase price given in a business combination after all identified assets have been recorded. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment by comparing the implied 
39 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
fair value to its carrying value. During the first quarter of 2003, we made a claim against all of the 155,760 common shares in escrow from the acquisition
of 1mind Corporation 1mind. In April 2003, the shares were returned, retired and cancelled. This resulted in a $09 million reduction of goodwill and additional paid in capital.  p Deferred taxes 
Deferred taxes are provided for differences in the bases of our assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on tax
rates expected to be in effect when these items reverse. Valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  2. VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS  We maintain allowances for bad debts based on factors such as the
composition of accounts receivable, historical bad debt experience, and current economic trends. These estimates are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in facts and circumstances. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $04 million and $05
million, respectively, at December 31, 2003 and 2002. Reductions in 2003 and 2002 are due to improvements in trade accounts receivable and collections of accounts for which reserves had been provided. The following is a roll forward of the allowance

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  a Preferred stock  We have authorized 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our Board of Directors has authority
to issue the shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and the qualifications, limitations
or restrictions thereof, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common stock, and may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. We had not issued any shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2003.  b Common stock  We have 45,000,000 authorized shares of common stock at $01 par value, of which 35,212,505 shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2003.
c 1994 Long-term incentive plan  In 1994, we adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan since amended, the
1994 Plan to provide employees, directors and consultants with opportunities to purchase stock through incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options.  In addition to options, eligible participants under the 1994 Plan may be granted stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
and long-term performance awards. As of December 31, 2003, a total of 130 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan and approximately 15 million shares were available for issuance.  The Compensation Committee administers the 1994 plan. Generally the option
price per share is determined at the date of grant. Options granted under the 1994 Plan generally vest over four years and expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.  d 1996 Non-employee director stock option plan  The 1996 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan the Director
Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 13, 1996 and approved by the stockholders on June 26, 1996. An amendment and restatement of the Director Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on November 23, 1999. As amended and
restated, the Director Plan provides for the grant to each new non-employee Director of Pegasystems on the date he or she first becomes a Director of an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market
value thereof on the date of grant, such option to vest in equal annual installments over three years. It also provides for the grant to each non-employee Director at the time of the regular meeting of Directors following the annual stockholders
meeting commencing in 2000 of a fully vested option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to the fair market value thereof on the date of grant. Prior to amendment and restatement, the Director Plan provided for the
grant to each new non-employee Director of

Pegasystems on the date he or she first became a Director of Pegasystems an option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock at a price per share equal to
the fair market value thereof on the date of grant, such options to vest in equal annual installments over five years. At December 31, 2003, under the Director Plan there were outstanding options to purchase a total of 250,000 shares of common stock
and no additional shares were available for issuance. The Compensation Committee administers the Director Plan. We do not plan to issue any additional options under the Director Plan. In 2003, options were granted to non-employee Directors under the
1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  e 1996 employee stock
purchase plan  The 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on May 13, 1996 and approved by the stockholders on June 26, 1996. There are 1,000,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to this plan. Under the terms of
the Stock Purchase Plan, employees are entitled to purchase shares at 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on either the commencement date or completion date for offerings under the plan, whichever is less. To date, there have been nine
offerings under the Stock Purchase Plan and approximately 06 million shares have been issued thereunder. The Stock Purchase Plan is tax qualified and no compensation expense related to shares issued under the plan has been recognized in the
financial statements.  Stock Options Summary  The following table presents the combined activity for the 1994 Plan and the

5. PURCHASED SOFTWARE AND WARRANT AGREEMENTS WITH FDR  In 1997, we entered into Software License and Support and Warrant Agreements
with First Data Resources, Inc. FDR. In accordance with the Software License and Support Agreement, we were granted a license for access to and the use of the designs, specifications and code of FDRs ESP product. As consideration
for this right, we paid FDR $100 million. This amount was recorded as purchased software on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Software License and Support Agreement, we gave a warrant to FDR to purchase 284,876
shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $2825 per share which represented the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the agreement. The warrant became exercisable on June 27, 1998 and expired during the fourth quarter of
2002. The warrant was valued at $29 million. We amortized the value of the purchased software and the warrant on a pro rata basis over the initial 51/2 year term of the agreement. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we recorded amortization expense of approximately $23 million per year, related to the ESP software and warrant. The
asset was fully amortized during 2002.  6. COMMITMENTS AND
CONTINGENCIES  We lease certain equipment and office space
under non-cancelable operating leases with various extension dates through 2013. Rent expense under operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis. Future minimum rental payments required under operating leases with non-cancelable terms in
excess of one year at December 31, 2003 are as follows:  Years ending December 31 inthousands

We are a party in various contractual disputes, litigation and potential claims arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the
resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.  7. INCOME TAXES  The components of income before provision for income taxes are as follows for the years ended December31:  2003

tax purposes. The components of our net deferred tax assets liabilities as of December 31, are as follows:  2003 2002 inthousands Software revenue 28,638 28,331 Depreciation 789 748 Vacation accrual 334 267 Receivable and other reserves 3,207 1,254 Net operating loss carry forward 20,225 28,737 Tax credits 6,514 5,819 Net deferred tax assets 2,431 8,494 Less valuation allowances 3,056 8,494 625 
44 Table of Contents PEGASYSTEMS INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
A valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets since it is uncertain if we
will realize the entire benefit of the assets. The decrease in the valuation allowance during the year resulted from the generation of additional future taxable temporary differences and the utilization of U.S. net operating tax losses. Of the
valuation allowance at December 31, 2003, approximately $04 million was related to acquired tax loss and credit carry forwards, which if utilized will reduce goodwill. In addition, these acquired tax benefits are subject to limitation by the
provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2003, approximately $07 million was related to tax benefits generated on exercise of stock options, which will be recorded directly to equity when
realized. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, approximately $38 million, $50 million, and $42 million of valuation allowances were reversed through the statements of income, respectively.  At December 31, 2003, we had alternative minimum tax AMT, and
research and experimentation RE net credit carry forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately $65 million, available to offset future taxable income. The carry forward period for the AMT credit is unlimited. The
RE credit carry forwards generally expire from 2004 to 2023.  As of December 31, 2003, we have available U.S. net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $511 million. The operating loss carry forwards expire from 2004 to 2020. These carry forwards may be used to offset future income taxes
payable at the federal and state levels, if any, and are subject to review by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities.  A provision has not been made for the U.S. or additional foreign taxes on $26 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that could be
subject to taxation if remitted to the U.S., because we plan to keep these amounts permanently reinvested overseas.  8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN  We sponsor a retirement plan for qualifying employees. This Plan is a 401k defined contribution plan. We provide a discretionary matching profit sharing
contribution. The contributions paid by us aggregated approximately $06 million in 2003, $04 million in 2002, and $02 million in 2001.

10. ACQUISITION  On February 6, 2002, we acquired substantially all of the assets of 1mind Corporation 1mind for initial consideration of $37 million
consisting of 569,949 shares of our common stock 155,760 shares of which were deposited into escrow to secure the indemnity obligations of 1minds equity holders relating to the transaction and warrants to purchase 83,092 shares of common
stock for nominal consideration. We believe that the acquisition will help increase our penetration of the healthcare and insurance markets, strengthen our management and delivery teams and deepen our product offerings. The acquisition of 1mind was
accounted for as a purchase and the operations of 1mind have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Results of operations would not have changed materially for 2002 or 2001 if 1mind had been acquired on
January 1, 2002 or 2001. The cash flow impact of $573 thousand from this acquisition was transaction costs of $614 thousand less cash acquired of $41 thousand. The purchase price allocation is based on the report of an independent appraiser. The
purchase agreement included provisions for additional consideration, which we are not obligated to pay because of the performance of the acquired business since the acquisition date.  in thousands, except for share-related data Shares issued a 3,295 Warrants issued b 374 Total purchase price 3,669 Current assets, including cash of $41 207 Equipment and improvements 143 Acquired technology c 1,400 Goodwill d 3,246 Current liabilities 563 Long-term liabilities 150 Transaction costs 614 3,669 a

Acquired technology results from an appraisal report of 1mind intangible assets. This asset is being amortized over its expected useful life of four years. d
This asset is considered to have an indeterminate life and amortization is not provided. This asset is subject to an annual impairment test, which is conducted annually in November.
No impairment adjustments have been required. Goodwill and additional paid-in capital were reduced in 2003 by $09 million due to the return of shares which had been held in escrow pending determination of the final purchase price made by the
sellers.
