Report on 
Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
To
the Shareholders of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation
and
Subsidiaries
The
management of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation BNSF is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
BNSFs internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of BNSFs financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America.
Management
of BNSF assessed the effectiveness of BNSFs internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management of BNSF
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this
assessment, management of BNSF concluded that as of December 31, 2009, BNSFs
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria.
The
effectiveness of BNSFs internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2009, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, BNSFs independent
registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on
the following page.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To
the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation
In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation and its subsidiaries the Company at December 31,
2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements and on the Company internal control
over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.
A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; ii
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.
The Company
Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporation BNSF or the Company is a holding company that
conducts no operating activities and owns no significant assets other than
through its interests in its subsidiaries. BNSFs principal, wholly-owned
subsidiary is BNSF Railway Company BNSF Railway, which operates one of the
largest railroad networks in North America with approximately 32,000 route miles
in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. Through one operating transportation
services segment, BNSF Railway transports a wide range of products and
commodities including the transportation of Consumer Products, Coal, Industrial
Products and Agricultural Products, derived from manufacturing, agricultural and
natural resource industries, which constituted 32 percent, 26 percent, 21
percent and 21 percent, respectively, of total freight revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2009. These Consolidated Financial Statements include BNSF,
BNSF Railway and other majority-owned subsidiaries, all of which are separate
legal entities.
Proposed
Merger
Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation Berkshire, R Acquisition Company, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Berkshire Merger Sub, and the Company have entered into a definitive Agreement
and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement dated as of November 2,
2009.Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject to the conditions set
forth therein, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub the Merger with
Merger Sub surviving as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire. Merger
Sub will change its name to Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC upon completion of
the Merger.
Under the
Merger Agreement, approximately 60% of the total merger consideration payable by
Berkshire to BNSF stockholders will be in the form of cash and approximately 40%
will be in the form of Berkshire common stock. Fractional shares of Berkshire
Class A common stock will not be issued in the Merger. Instead, shares of
Berkshire Class B common stock will be issued in lieu of any fractional shares
of Berkshire ClassA common stock, and cash will be paid in lieu of any
fractional shares of Berkshire Class B common stock.
On
February 11, 2010, the Merger Agreement was adopted by the necessary votes of
BNSF stockholders. The Merger is expected to close on February 12,
2010.
2.
Significant Accounting Policies
Adoption of Accounting
Standards Codification
In June
2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued authoritative
accounting guidance which established the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
Codification or ASC as the source of authoritative accounting principles
recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities and stated that
all guidance contained in the Codification carries an equal level of authority.
The authoritative accounting guidance recognized that rules and interpretive
releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under federal
securities laws are also sources of authoritative Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles GAAP for SEC registrants. The Company adopted the provisions of the
authoritative accounting guidance on July 1, 2009, the adoption of which did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial
statements.
Principles of
Consolidation
The
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of BNSF, including its
principal subsidiary BNSF Railway. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. The Company evaluates its less than
majority-owned investments for consolidation pursuant to authoritative
accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest
entities.
Use of
Estimates
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the periods presented. These estimates and assumptions are periodically
reviewed by management. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
42
Table of Contents
Revenue
Recognition
Transportation
revenues are recognized based upon the proportion of service provided as of the
balance sheet date. Revenues from ancillary services are recognized when
performed. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a
specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded
as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected
future customer shipments. When using projected shipments, the Company relies on
historic trends as well as economic and other indicators to estimate the
liability for customer incentives.
Accounts Receivable,
Net
Accounts
receivable, net includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for bill
adjustments and uncollectible accounts. The allowance for bill adjustments and
uncollectible accounts is based on historical experience as well as any known
trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility.
Additionally, accounts receivable, net is reduced by receivables sold under the
Accounts Receivable sales program see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
All
short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are
considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
approximates market value because of the short maturity of these
instruments.
Materials and
Supplies
Materials
and supplies, which consist mainly of rail, ties and other items for
construction and maintenance of property and equipment, as well as diesel fuel,
are valued at the lower of average cost or market.
Property and Equipment,
Net
Property
and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated and amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company uses the
group method of depreciation in which a single depreciation rate is applied to
the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in
the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same
class. The Company conducts studies of depreciation rates and the required
accumulated depreciation balance as required by the Surface Transportation Board
STB, which is generally every three years for equipment property and every six
years for track structure and other roadway property. Changes in the estimated
service lives of the assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented
prospectively, and the difference between the calculated accumulated
depreciation and the amount recorded is amortized over the average remaining
service lives of the assets. Upon normal sale or retirement of certain
depreciable railroad property, cost less net salvage value is charged to
accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized. The disposals of
land and non-rail property as well as significant premature retirements are
recorded as gains or losses at the time of their occurrence. 
The
Company self-constructs portions of its track structure and rebuilds certain
classes of rolling stock. Expenditures that significantly increase asset values
or extend useful lives are capitalized. In addition to direct labor and
material, certain indirect costs, which relate to supportive functions, are
capitalized. Repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to operating
expense when the work is performed. 
The
Company incurs certain direct labor, contract service and other costs associated
with the development and installation of internal-use computer software. Costs
for newly developed software or significant enhancements to existing software
are typically capitalized. Research, preliminary project, operations,
maintenance and training costs are charged to operating expense when the work is
performed.
Long-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If
impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying
value is reduced to the estimated fair value as measured by the discounted cash
flows. 
Leasehold
improvements that meet capitalization criteria are capitalized and amortized on
a straight-line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the
remaining lease term. Cash flows for capitalized leasehold improvements are
reported in the investing activities other, net line of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.
Planned Major Maintenance
Activities 
The
Company utilizes the deferral method of accounting for leased locomotive
overhauls, which includes the refurbishment of the engine and related
components. Accordingly, BNSF has established an asset for overhauls that have
been performed. This asset, which is included in property and equipment, net in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is amortized to expense using the straight-line
method until the next overhaul is performed or the end of the lease, whichever
comes first, typically between six and eight years.
43
Table of Contents
Environmental
Liabilities
Liabilities
for environmental cleanup costs are initially recorded when BNSFs liability for
environmental cleanup is both probable and reasonably estimable. Subsequent
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional
information developed in subsequent periods. Estimates for these liabilities are
undiscounted.
Personal Injury
Claims
Liabilities
for personal injury claims are initially recorded when the expected loss is both
probable and reasonably estimable. Subsequent adjustments to initial estimates
are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in
subsequent periods. Liabilities recorded for unasserted personal injury claims,
including those related to asbestos, are based on information currently
available. Estimates of liabilities for personal injury claims are
undiscounted.
Income
Taxes
Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that apply to
taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is
expected to be realized or paid. Changes in the Companys estimates regarding
the statutory tax rate to be applied to the reversal of deferred tax assets and
liabilities could materially affect the effective tax rate. Valuation allowances
are established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. BNSF has not
recorded a valuation allowance, as it believes that the deferred tax assets will
be fully realized in the future. Investment tax credits are accounted for using
the flow-through method.
The
Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is
more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by
the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent
likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
Stock-Based
Compensation
The
Company recognizes the compensation expense related to the cost of employee
services received in exchange for company equity interests over the awards
vesting period based on the awards fair value at the date of grant.
Employment Benefit
Plans
The
Company estimates liabilities and expenses for the pension and retiree health
and welfare plans. Estimated amounts are based on historical information,
current information and estimates regarding future events and circumstances.
Significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and/or retiree health
and welfare liabilities include the expected return on plan assets, discount
rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend
rate.
Fair Value
Measurements
In
September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosure requirements around fair value measurements.
The
authoritative accounting guidance specifies a three-level hierarchy of valuation
inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability
in fair value measurements and related disclosures.
Level
1Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that
the Company has the ability to access at the measurement
date.
Level
2Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets
that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant
inputs are observable market data. 
Level
3Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more
significant inputs are unobservable.
The
authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to maximize the use of
observable inputs Level 1 and Level 2, when available, and to minimize the use
of unobservable inputs Level 3 when determining fair value. 
The
Company adopted the authoritative accounting guidance for financial assets and
liabilities on January 1, 2008, and recorded no financial statement adjustments
as a result of adoption. The Company has applied the provisions of the standard
to its fuel and interest rate hedges see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Beginning
January 1, 2009, the Company applied the provisions of the standard to its
property and equipment, goodwill and certain other assets, which are measured at
fair value for impairment assessment, and to any business combinations or asset
retirement obligations as required by authoritative accounting guidance. This
adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity.

3.
Hedging Activities
The
Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge against increases in
diesel fuel prices and interest rates as well as to convert a portion of its
fixed-rate, long-term debt to floating-rate debt. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The
Company formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and
the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for the
use of the hedging instrument. This documentation includes linking the
derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet, commitments or forecasted
transactions. The Company assesses at the time a derivative contract is entered
into, and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivative item is
effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows. Any change in
fair value resulting from ineffectiveness, as defined by authoritative
accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging, is recognized in current
period earnings. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
instrument is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL as a
separate component of stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the
period during which the hedge transaction affects earnings. Cash flows related
to fuel and interest rate derivatives are classified as operating activities in
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
BNSF
monitors its hedging positions and credit ratings of its counterparties and does
not anticipate any losses due to counterparty nonperformance. All counterparties
were financial institutions with credit ratings of A2/A or higher as of December
31, 2009. The maximum amount of loss the Company could incur from credit risk
based on the gross fair value of derivative instruments in asset positions as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $104 million and $77 million, respectively.
Other than as disclosed under the heading Fuel; Total Fuel-Hedging Activities,
the Companys hedge agreements do not include provisions requiring collateral.
Certain of the Companys hedge instruments are covered by master netting
arrangements whereby, in the event of a default, the non-defaulting party has
the right to setoff any amounts payable against any obligation of the defaulting
party under the same counterparty agreement. As such, the Companys net asset
exposure to counterparty credit risk was $90 million and $53 million as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Additional
disclosures related to derivative instruments are included in Note 8 and Note 9
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The
amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for derivative transactions
were as follows in millions. These amounts exclude $106 million of collateral
posted for certain fuel hedge contracts as of December 31, 2008.

Fuel
Fuel
costs represented 22 percent, 33 percent and 27 percent of total operating
expenses during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Due to the significance of
diesel fuel expenses to the operations of BNSF and the historical volatility of
fuel prices, the Company has entered into hedges to partially mitigate the risk
of fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases. The fuel hedges
include the use of derivatives that are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
hedging is intended to protect the Companys operating margins and overall
profitability from adverse fuel price changes by entering into fuel-hedge
instruments based on managements evaluation of current and expected diesel fuel
price trends. However, to the extent the Company hedges portions of its fuel
purchases, it may not realize the impact of decreases in fuel prices.
Conversely, to the extent the Company does not hedge portions of its fuel
purchases, it may be adversely affected by increases in fuel prices. Based on
locomotive fuel consumption which represents substantially all fuel
consumptionduring
2009 and excluding the impact of the hedges, each one-cent increase in the price
of fuel per gallon would result in approximately $12 million of additional fuel
expense on an annual basis. However, BNSF believes any fuel price increase would
be substantially offset by the Companys fuel surcharge program.
Total
Fuel-Hedging Activities
As of
December 31, 2009, BNSFs total fuel-hedging positions for 2010, 2011 and 2012
represent 21 percent, 17 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of the average
annual locomotive fuel consumption over the past three years. Hedge positions
are closely monitored to ensure that they will not exceed actual fuel
requirements in any period.
The

transactions were as follows in millions:

Table of Contents
Certain
of the Companys fuel-hedge instruments are covered by an agreement which
includes a provision such that the Company either receives or posts cash
collateral if the fair value of the instruments exceeds a certain net asset or
net liability threshold, respectively. The threshold is based on a sliding
scale, utilizing either the counterpartys credit rating, if the instruments are
in a net asset position, or BNSFs credit rating, if the instruments are in a
net liability position. If the applicable credit rating should fall below Ba3
Moodys or BB- SP, the threshold would be eliminated and collateral
would be required for the entire fair value amount. All cash collateral paid is
held on deposit by the payee and earns interest to the benefit of the payor
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR. The aggregate fair value of
all open fuel-hedge instruments under these provisions was in a net liability
position on December 31, 2009, of $18 million, which was below the collateral
threshold. As such, there was no posted collateral outstanding at December 31,
2009. As of December 31, 2008, the aggregate fair value of all open fuel-hedge
instruments under these provisions was in a net liability position of $131
million for which the Company posted collateral of $106 million. Additional
collateral of $20 million was posted related to settled fuel-hedging contracts
payable at December 31, 2008. The collateral was reflected as a reduction to
either accounts payable and other current liabilities or other liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on the expiration date of the related
fuel hedges. The settled fuel-hedge liabilities presented in the table above do
not reflect a reduction for the posted collateral.
The
Company uses the forward commodity price for the periods hedged to value its
fuel-hedge swaps and costless collars. This methodology is a market approach,
which under authoritative accounting guidance related to fair value measurements
utilizes Level 2 inputs as it uses market data for similar instruments in active
markets.
New York Mercantile Exchange
NYMEX #2 Heating Oil HO Hedges
As of
December 31, 2009, BNSF had entered into fuel swap agreements utilizing NYMEX #2
HO. The hedge prices do not include taxes, transportation costs, certain other
fuel handling costs and any differences that may occur between the prices of HO
and the purchase price of BNSFs diesel fuel. Over the twelve months ended
December 31, 2009, the sum of all such costs averaged approximately 9 cents per
gallon. 
During
2009, the Company entered into fuel swap agreements utilizing HO to hedge the
equivalent of approximately 7735 million gallons of fuel with an average swap
price of $195 per gallon. The following tables provide fuel-hedge data based on

From time
to time, the Company enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for
the purpose of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by
establishing rates in anticipation of both future debt issuances and the
refinancing of leveraged leases, as well as converting a portion of its
fixed-rate, long-term debt to floating-rate debt. The Company uses interest rate
swaps and treasury locks as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.

Fair Value Interest Rate
Hedges 
The
Company enters into interest rate swaps to convert fixed-rate, long-term debt to
floating-rate debt. These swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges under
authoritative accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging. These fair
value hedges qualify for the short-cut method of recognition; therefore, no
portion of these swaps is treated as ineffective. 
The gain
or loss on the fair value hedges as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the
hedged items fixed-rate debt attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in
current earnings. The Company included the gain or loss on the fixed-rate debt
in the same line item interest expense as the offsetting loss or gain on the
related interest rate swaps, which is presented in the following table for the
years ended December 31 in millions:

As of
each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, BNSF had nine and eleven
outstanding swaps, respectively, with an aggregate notional amount of
$650million and $850million, respectively, in which it pays an
average floating rate, which fluctuates quarterly, based on London Interbank
Offered Rate LIBOR. The average floating rate to be paid by BNSF as of
December 31, 2009, was 222 percent, and the average fixed rate BNSF is to
receive is 628 percent. 
In March
of 2008, the Company entered into four interest rate swaps having an aggregate
notional amount of $400 million to convert fixed-rate, long-term debt to
floating-rate debt. These swaps were entered into at the inception of new
10-year notes see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

amount of $500 million and a locked-in rate of 346 percent, to fix a portion of
the rate for a 10-year unsecured debt issuance. The treasury lock was terminated
in connection with the issuance of $750 million 10-year notes see Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon termination, BNSF received
approximately $600 thousand from the counterparty, which will be amortized as a
reduction to interest expense over the life of the issued debt. This transaction
was accounted for as a cash flow hedge. As of December 31, 2009, no cash flow
hedges were outstanding.
In
anticipation of a future debt issuance, the Company entered into five treasury
locks during 2008 having an aggregate notional amount of $250 million, and an
average locked-in rate of 418 percent, to fix a portion of the rate for a
future 30-year unsecured debt issuance. The Company also entered into six
treasury locks during 2008 having an aggregate notional amount of $150 million,
and an average locked-in rate of 380 percent, to fix a portion of the rate for
a future 10-year unsecured debt issuance. These transactions were previously
accounted for as cash flow hedges. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company
determined that it was no longer probable that it would issue debt according to
the terms of the hedges. As such, hedge accounting could no longer be applied to
the treasury locks. The treasury locks were terminated in early April and $32
million was paid to the counterparties, which was the fair value of the treasury
locks at the date of termination. Therefore, a net $32 million loss was
recognized as an increase to interest expense.

In
anticipation of a future debt issuance, the Company entered into nine treasury
locks during 2008 and 2007, having an aggregate notional amount of $250 million,
and an average locked-in rate of 424 percent, to fix a portion of the rate for
a future 10-year unsecured debt issuance. The treasury locks were terminated in
March 2008 in connection with the issuance of $650 million 10-year notes see
Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon termination, BNSF paid
$13 million to the counterparties, which will be amortized to interest expense
over the life of the issued debt. These transactions are accounted for as cash
flow hedges.
AOCL
included $8 million and $6 million of unrecognized gains on closed hedges as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These amounts will be amortized to
interest expense over the life of the corresponding issued debt.

The
decrease in other expense, net was predominantly due to lower accounts
receivable sales fees see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information, partially offset by lower interest and investment
income.
During
the fourth quarter of 2004, BNSF Railway indirectly purchased a 417 percent
ownership of a synthetic fuel partnership through a 50 percent interest in a
limited liability company with an unrelated entity. The synthetic fuel
partnership generated Section 29 synthetic fuel tax credits, which reduced the
Companys effective tax rate see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information. In 2007, BNSF Railway received a tax
benefit from its participation in the partnership of approximately
$7million related to the fuel tax credits and the deduction of partnership
operating losses. In 2007, the Company recorded approximately $5million of
other expense, net related to the Companys share of the partnerships losses
under the equity method of accounting. The partnership did not qualify for
consolidation under authoritative accounting guidance related to the
consolidation of variable interest entities, as BNSF Railway was not the primary
beneficiary of the partnership. Under the tax law, the Section 29 synthetic fuel
tax credits terminated on December 31, 2007; under the BNSF Railways purchase
agreement, it did not have any additionalexposure to loss from the
synthetic fuel partnership after that date.

All
federal income tax returns of BNSF are closed through 1999. Internal Revenue
Service IRS examination of the years 2000 through 2007 for BNSF is completed,
and the un-agreed issues for 2000 through 2007 are pending before IRS Appeals.
It is anticipated that a settlement with the IRS for the years 2000 through 2005
may be reached within the next twelve months. BNSF is currently under
examination for year 2008. 
BNSF and
its subsidiaries have various state income tax returns in the process of
examination, administrative appeal or litigation. State income tax returns are
generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after
filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains
subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after
formal notification to the states. 
A
significant portion of the audit issues relate to state income tax issues with
various taxing authorities and with the IRS related to whether certain
valuations of donated property are appropriate. A provision for taxes resulting
from ongoing and future federal and state audits is based on an estimation of
aggregate adjustments that may be required as a result of the audits. The
Company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment that
might be assessed for open years through 2009.
Uncertain Tax
Positions
The
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was
$166 million, $150million and $125 million, respectively. The amount of
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009, that would affect the Companys
effective tax rate if recognized was $97 million. A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in

It is
expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next
twelve months; however, BNSF does not expect the change to have a significant
impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.
The
Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in
interest expense and penalties in income tax expense in the Consolidated
Statements of Income, which is consistent with the recognition of these items in
prior reporting periods. The Company had recorded a liability of approximately
$23 million and $33 million for the payment of interest and penalties for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. For the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized a reduction of
approximately $8 million, $18 million and $7 million in interest and penalty
expense, respectively.

Accounts Receivable, Net
BNSF
Railway sells a portion of its accounts receivable to Santa Fe Receivables
Corporation SFRC, a special purpose subsidiary. The sole purpose and activity
of SFRC is to purchase receivables from BNSF Railway. SFRC transfers an
undivided interest in such receivables, with limited exceptions, to a master
trust and causes the trust to issue an undivided interest in the receivables to
investors the A/R sales program. The undivided interests in the master trust
may be in the form of certificates or purchased interests and are isolated from
BNSF Railway which eliminates all of BNSF Railways control over the undivided
interest. 
BNSF
Railways total capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the A/R
sales program was $700million at December 31, 2009, which was comprised of
two $175 million, 364-day accounts receivable facilities and two $175 million,
3-year accounts receivable facilities. In November 2009, BNSF Railway extended
the commitment termination date of the two 364-day facilities to November 2010.
The two 3-year facilities were entered into in November 2007 and have a
commitment termination date in November 2010. Each of the financial institutions
providing credit for the facilities is rated Aa3/A+ or higher. There was no
outstanding undivided interest held by investors at December 31, 2009.
Outstanding undivided interests held by investors under the A/R sales program
were $50 million at December 31, 2008, with $125 million allocated to each
facility. The undivided interests in receivables held by investors are excluded
from accounts receivable by BNSF Railway in connection with the sale of
undivided interests under the A/R sales program. As of December 31, 2009 and
2008, an interest in $801 million and $878 million, respectively, of receivables
had been transferred by SFRC to the master trust. When SFRC transfers the
interest in these receivables to the master trust, it retains an undivided
interest in the receivables, which is included in accounts receivable in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The interest that continued to be held by
SFRC of $801 million and $828 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, less an allowance for uncollectible accounts, reflected the total
accounts receivable transferred by SFRC to the master trust less $50 million of
outstanding undivided interests held by investors at December 31, 2008. Due to a
relatively short collection cycle, the fair value of the undivided interest
transferred to investors in the A/R sales program approximated book value, and
there was no gain or loss from the transaction.
BNSF
Railway retains the collection responsibility with respect to the accounts
receivable. Proceeds from collections reinvested in the A/R sales program were
approximately $152billion, $195billion and $168billion in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No servicing asset or liability has been
recorded because the fees BNSF Railway receives for servicing the receivables
approximate the related costs. SFRCs costs of the sale of receivables are
included in other expense, net and were $3million, $12million and
$19million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. These costs fluctuate monthly with changes in prevailing interest
rates as well as unused available commitments and include interest, discounts
associated with transferring the receivables under the A/R sales program to
SFRC, program fees paid to banks, incidental commercial paper issuing costs and
fees for unused commitment availability. 
The
amount of undivided interests in the accounts receivable sold by BNSF Railway to
investors fluctuates based on borrowing needs and upon the availability of
receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit
risks, which may, from time to time, reduce the effective capacity of the
program to less than the $700 million. At December 31, 2009, the effective
capacity under the A/R sales program was $611 million. Additionally, if the
combined dilution and delinquency percentages exceed an established threshold,
there would be an impact on the amount of undivided interest that BNSF Railway
could sell. BNSF Railway has historically experienced very low levels of
dilution or delinquency and was below the established reserve threshold at
December 31, 2009. Based on the current levels, if dilution or delinquency
percentages were to increase by one percentage point, there would be no impact
to the amount of undivided interests BNSF Railway could sell. 
Receivables
eligible under the A/R sales program do not include receivables over 90 days
past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer and certain
other receivables.At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, $11million and $9 million, respectively, of
such accounts receivable were greater than 90 days old. 
BNSF
Railway maintains an allowance for bill adjustments and uncollectible accounts
based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable, including
receivables transferred to the master trust. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 31million and $43 million, respectively of such allowances had been
recorded, of which $31million and $42 million, respectively, had been
recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net. The remaining $1 million at
December 31, 2008, had been recorded in accounts payable and other current
liabilities because it relates to the outstanding undivided interests held by
investors. During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, $16million
and $15million, respectively, of accounts receivable were written off, net
of recoveries. Credit losses are based on specific identification of
uncollectible accounts and application of historical collection percentages by
aging category.
The
investors in the master trust have no recourse to BNSF Railways other assets
except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of BNSF Railway
have no recourse to the assets of the master trust or SFRC until after the
creditors have been paid and SFRC and the master trust have been terminated. The
A/R sales program includes thresholds for dilution, delinquency and write-off
ratios that, if exceeded, allow the investors participating in this program, at
their option, to cancel the program. At December 31, 2009, BNSF Railway was in
compliance with these provisions.
See Note
16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about recent
accounting pronouncements that will have an impact on the A/R sales program upon
adoption.

and variable-rate debt was $7,300 million and $1,023 million,
respectively.
The fair
value of BNSFs long-term debt is primarily based on quoted market prices for
the same or similar issues, or on the current rates that would be offered to
BNSF for debt of the same remaining maturities. Capital leases have been
excluded from the calculation of fair value for both 2009 and 2008.
Notes and
Debentures

56
Table of Contents
2008
In 2008,
BNSF Railway entered into a capital lease for approximately $158 million to
finance locomotives and freight cars. The term of the lease is 20 years.
Additionally, BNSF Railway entered into capital leases totaling $100 million to
finance maintenance of way and other vehicles and equipment with lease terms of
three to seven years.
2007
In 2007,
BNSF Railway entered into several capital leases totaling approximately $325
million to finance locomotives and freight cars. The terms of the leases are
between 15 and 20 years. Additionally, BNSF Railway entered into capital leases
totaling $119 million to finance maintenance of way and other vehicles and
equipment with lease terms of three to seven
years.
Financing
Obligation
In 2005,
the Company commenced the construction of an intermodal facility that it
intended to sell to a third party and subsequently lease back. In 2009,
construction of the facility was completed for a cost of approximately $160
million. All improvements have been sold to the third party and BNSF leased the
facility from the third party for 20 years. This sale leaseback transaction was
accounted for as a financing obligation due to continuing involvement. The
outflows from the construction of the facility were classified as investing
activities, and the inflows from the associated financing proceeds were
classified as financing activities in the Companys Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.
Revolving Credit Facility
and Commercial Paper
As of
December 31, 2009, the Company had borrowing capacity of up to $12 billion
under its long-term revolving bank credit facility, which expires September
2012. Annual facility fees are currently 008 percent for the facility. The rate
is subject to change based upon changes in BNSFs senior unsecured debt ratings.
Borrowing rates are based upon i LIBOR plus a spread determined by BNSFs
senior unsecured debt ratings, ii money market rates offered at the option of
the lenders, or iii an alternate base rate. BNSF must maintain compliance with
certain financial covenants under its revolving bank credit facility. At
December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with these
covenants.
At
December 31, 2009, there were no bank borrowings against the revolving credit
facility.
BNSF
issues commercial paper from time to time that is supported by the revolving
bank credit facility. Outstanding commercial paper reduces the amount of
borrowing capacity available under the facility. The classification of
commercial paper is determined by the Companys ability and intent to use
long-term or short-term funding sources to settle the obligations at maturity.
At December 31, 2008, the Company classified outstanding commercial paper as
long-term debt. 
There was
no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2009; therefore, the total
borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility was $12
billion. 
Due to
the proposed Merger, the Company sought a waiver of the change of control
provision included in the revolving credit facility. In December 2009, the banks
participating in the facility provided unanimous consent for the waiver and
amended the revolving credit facility agreement to allow the use of an LLC legal
structure. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information related to the proposed Merger.

BNSF
Railway and another major railroad jointly and severally guarantee $48 million
of debt of Kansas City Terminal Intermodal Transportation Corporation, the
proceeds of which were used to finance construction of a double track grade
separation bridge in Kansas City, Missouri, which is operated and used by Kansas
City Terminal Railway Company KCTRC. BNSF Railway has a 25 percent ownership
in KCTRC, accounts for its interest using the equity method of accounting and
would be required to fund a portion of the remaining obligation upon default by
the original debtor.

Residual
Value Guarantees RVG
In the
normal course of business, the Company enters into leases in which it guarantees
the residual value of certain leased equipment. Some of these leases have
renewal or purchase options, or both, that the Company may exercise at the end
of the lease term. If the Company elects not to exercise these options, it may
be required to pay the lessor an amount not exceeding the RVG. The amount of any
payment is contingent upon the actual residual value of the leased equipment.
Some of these leases also require the lessor to pay the Company any surplus if
the actual residual value of the leased equipment is over the RVG. These
guarantees will expire between 2010 and 2011.
The
maximum future payments, as disclosed in the Guarantees table above, represent
the undiscounted maximum amount that the Company could be required to pay in the
event the Company did not exercise its renewal option and the fair market value
of the equipment had significantly declined. As of December 31, 2009, BNSF does
not anticipate such a large reduction in the fair market value of the leased
equipment. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had recorded a $68 million asset
and corresponding liability for the fair value of RVG. 
All
Other
As of
December 31, 2009, BNSF guaranteed $3 million of other debt and leases. BNSF
holds a performance bond and has the option to sub-lease property to recover up
to $1 million of the $3 million of guarantees. These guarantees expire between
2011 and 2013.
Other
than as discussed above, there is no collateral held by a third party that the
Company could obtain and liquidate to recover any amounts paid under the above
guarantees.
Other
than as discussed above, none of the guarantees are recorded in the Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Company. The Company does not expect performance
under these guarantees to have a material effect on the Company in the
foreseeable future.
Indemnities
In the
ordinary course of business, BNSF enters into agreements with third parties that
include indemnification clauses. In general, these clauses are customary for the
types of agreements in which they are included. At times, these clauses may
involve indemnification for the acts of the Company, its employees and agents,
indemnification for another partys acts, indemnification for future events,
indemnification based upon a certain standard of performance, indemnification
for liabilities arising out of the Companys use of leased equipment or other
property, or other types of indemnification. Due to the uncertainty of whether
events which would trigger the indemnification obligations would ever occur, the
Company does not believe that these indemnity agreements will have a material
adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial position or
liquidity. Additionally, the Company believes that, due to lack of historical
payment experience, the fair value of indemnities cannot be estimated with any
amount of certainty and that the fair value of any such amount would be
immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Agreements that contain
unique circumstances, particularly agreements that contain guarantees that
indemnify for another partys acts are disclosed separately if appropriate.
Unless separately disclosed above, no fair value liability related to
indemnities has been recorded in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Commitments and Contingencies
Lease
Commitments
BNSF has
substantial lease commitments for locomotives, freight cars, trailers and
containers, office buildings, operating facilities and other property, and many
of these leases provide the option to purchase the leased item at fair market
value at the end of the lease. However, some provide fixed price purchase
options. Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2009, are summarized

straight-line basis, the Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals and sublease rentals were not
significant.

Other
Commitments
In the
normal course of business, the Company enters into long-term contractual
requirements for future goods and services needed for the operations of the
business. Such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are
not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would
have a material adverse effect on the Companys liquidity.
Personal Injury and
Environmental Costs
Personal
Injury 
Personal
injury claims, including asbestos claims and employee work-related injuries and
third-party injuries collectively, other personal injury, are a significant
expense for the railroad industry. Personal injury claims by BNSF Railway
employees are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employers Liability Act
FELA rather than state workers compensation laws. FELAs system of requiring
the finding of fault, coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury
system, contributed to increased expenses in past years. Other proceedings
include claims by non-employees for punitive as well as compensatory damages. A
few proceedings purport to be class actions. The variability present in settling
these claims, including non-employee personal injury and matters in which
punitive damages are alleged, could result in increased expenses in future
years. BNSF has implemented a number of safety programs designed to reduce the
number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury
expense. 
BNSF
records a liability for personal injury claims when the expected loss is both
probable and reasonably estimable. The liability and ultimate expense
projections are estimated using standard actuarial methodologies. Liabilities
recorded for unasserted personal injury claims are based on information
currently available. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting
future events such as the number of claims filed each year, developments in
judicial and legislative standards and the average costs to settle projected
claims, actual costs may differ from amounts recorded. Expense accruals and any
required adjustments are classified as materials and other in the Consolidated
Statements of Income.
Asbestos
The
Company is party to a number of personal injury claims by employees and
non-employees who may have been exposed to asbestos. The heaviest exposure for
BNSF employees was due to work conducted in and around the use of steam
locomotive engines that were phased out between the years of 1950 and 1967.
However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component
parts and building materials, continued after 1967 until they were substantially
eliminated at BNSF by 1985. 
BNSF
assesses its unasserted liability exposure on an annual basis during the third
quarter. BNSF determines its asbestos liability by estimating its exposed
population, the number of claims likely to be filed, the number of claims that
will likely require payment and the estimated cost per claim. Estimated filing
and dismissal rates and average cost per claim are determined utilizing recent
claim data and trends.
During
the third quarters of 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company analyzed recent filing
and payment trends to ensure the assumptions used by BNSF to estimate its future
asbestos liability were reasonable. In 2007, management recorded a decrease in
expense of $17million due to a statistically significant reduction in
filing rate experience for non-malignant claims. In 2009 and 2008, management
determined that the liability remained appropriate and no change was recorded.
The Company plans to update its study again in the third quarter of
2010.
Throughout
the year, BNSF monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted
claims and expected claim payments and will record adjustments to the Companys
estimates as necessary.

Of the
obligation at December 31, 2009, $198 million was related to unasserted claims
while $38 million was related to asserted claims. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 16 million and $17million was included in current liabilities,
respectively. The recorded liability was not discounted. In addition, defense
and processing costs, which are recorded on an as-reported basis, were not
included in the recorded liability. The Company is primarily self-insured for
asbestos-related claims.

Based on
BNSFs estimate of the potentially exposed employees and related mortality
assumptions, it is anticipated that unasserted claims will continue to be filed
through the year 2050. The Company recorded an amount for the full estimated
filing period through 2050 because it had a relatively finite exposed population
former and current employees hired prior to 1985, which it was able to
identify and reasonably estimate and about which it had obtained reliable
demographic data including age, hire date and occupation derived from industry
or BNSF specific data that was the basis for the study. BNSF projects that
approximately 55, 75 and 90 percent of the future unasserted asbestos claims
will be filed within the next 10, 15 and 25 years, respectively. 
Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the factors used in the study, it is reasonably
possible that future costs to settle asbestos claims may range from
approximately $212 million to $257 million. However, BNSF believes that the $236
million recorded at December 31, 2009, is the best estimate of the Companys
future obligation for the settlement of asbestos claims.
The
amounts recorded by BNSF for the asbestos-related liability were based upon
currently known facts. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be
filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the
numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States,
could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected. 
While the
final outcome of asbestos-related matters cannot be predicted with certainty,
considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and
liabilities that have been recorded, it is the opinion of BNSF that none of
these items, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the
Companys financial position or liquidity. However, the occurrence of a number
of these items in the same period could have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
Other Personal
Injury
BNSF
estimates its other personal injury liability claims and expense quarterly based
on the covered population, activity levels and trends in frequency and the costs
of covered injuries. Estimates include unasserted claims except for certain
repetitive stress and other occupational trauma claims that allegedly result
from prolonged repeated events or exposure. Such claims are estimated on an
as-reported basis because the Company cannot estimate the range of reasonably
possible loss due to other non-work related contributing causes of such injuries
and the fact that continued exposure is required for the potential injury to
manifest itself as a claim. BNSF has not experienced any significant adverse
trends related to these types of claims in recent years.
BNSF
monitors quarterly actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to
be received, the forecasted number of claims closing with payment and expected
claims payments. Adjustments to the Companys estimates are recorded quarterly
as necessary or more frequently as new events or revised estimates
develop.

Because
of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of other personal injury
claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle other personal
injury claims may range from approximately $345 million to $495 million.
However, BNSF believes that the $396 million recorded at December 31, 2009, is
the best estimate of the Companys future obligation for the settlement of other
personal injury claims.
The
amounts recorded by BNSF for other personal injury claims were based upon
currently known facts. Future events, such as the number of new claims to be
filed each year, the average cost of disposing of claims, as well as the
numerous uncertainties surrounding personal injury litigation in the United
States, could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than

effect on the Companys financial position or liquidity. However, the occurrence
of a number of these items in the same period could have a material adverse
effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal
year.
BNSF Insurance
Company
The
Company has a consolidated, wholly-owned subsidiary, Burlington Northern Santa
Fe Insurance Company, Ltd. BNSF IC that provides insurance coverage for
certain risks incurred after April 1, 1998, FELA claims, railroad protective and
force account insurance claims and certain excess general liability coverage
incurred after January 1, 2002, and certain other claims which are subject to
reinsurance. Beginning in 2004, BNSF IC entered into annual reinsurance treaty
agreements with several other companies. The treaty agreements insure workers
compensation, general liability, auto liability and FELA risk. In accordance
with the agreements, BNSF IC cedes a portion of its FELA exposure through the
treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk. Each year BNSF IC
reviews the objectives and performance of the treaty to determine its continued
participation in the treaty. The treaty agreements provide for certain
protections against the risk of treaty participants non-performance. On an
on-going basis, BNSF and/or the treaty manager reviews the credit-worthiness of
each of the participants. BNSF does not believe its exposure to treaty
participants non-performance is material at this time. BNSF IC typically
invests in third-party commercial paper, time deposits and money market accounts
as well as in commercial paper issued by BNSF. At December 31, 2009, there was
approximately $485 million related to these third-party investments, which were
classified as cash and cash equivalents on the Companys Consolidated Balance
Sheet, as compared with approximately $425million at December 31, 2008.
Environmental
The
Companys operations, as well as those of its competitors, are subject to
extensive federal, state and local environmental regulation. BNSFs operating
procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent
in railroad operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and
other hazardous materials. Additionally, many of BNSFs land holdings are and
have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to
commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in
discharges onto the property. As a result, BNSF is subject to environmental
cleanup and enforcement actions. In particular, the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 CERCLA, also
known as the Superfund law, as well as similar state laws, generally impose
joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and
former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of
the original conduct. BNSF has been notified that it is a potentially
responsible party PRP for study and cleanup costs at Superfund sites for which
investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be
determined the Superfund sites and, in many instances, is one of several PRPs.
In addition, BNSF may be considered a PRP under certain other laws. Accordingly,
under CERCLA and other federal and state statutes, BNSF may be held jointly and
severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site.
If there are other PRPs, BNSF generally participates in the cleanup of these
sites through cost-sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site.
Costs are typically allocated based on such factors as relative volumetric
contribution of material, the amount of time the site was owned or operated
and/or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each PRP.
Liabilities
for environmental cleanup costs are recorded when BNSFs liability for
environmental cleanup is probable and reasonably estimable. Subsequent
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional
information developed in subsequent periods. Environmental costs include initial
site surveys and environmental studies as well as costs for remediation of sites
determined to be contaminated.
BNSF
estimates the ultimate cost of cleanup efforts at its known environmental sites
on an annual basis during the third quarter. Ultimate cost estimates for
environmental sites are based on historical payment patterns, current estimated
percentage to closure ratios and benchmark patterns developed from data
accumulated from industry and public sources, including the Environmental
Protection Agency and other governmental agencies. These factors incorporate
into the estimates experience gained from cleanup efforts at other similar
sites. 
62
Table of Contents
On a
quarterly basis, BNSF monitors actual experience against the forecasted
remediation and related payments made on existing sites and conducts ongoing
environmental contingency analyses, which consider a combination of factors
including independent consulting reports, site visits, legal reviews and
analysis of the likelihood of participation in, and the ability to pay for,
cleanup of other PRPs. Adjustments to the Companys estimates will continue to
be recorded as necessary based on developments in subsequent periods.
Additionally, environmental accruals, which are classified as materials and
other in the Consolidated Statements of Income, include amounts for newly
identified sites or contaminants, third-party claims and legal fees incurred for
defense of third-party claims and recovery efforts.
During
the third quarter of 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company analyzed recent data and
trends to ensure the assumptions used by BNSF to estimate its future
environmental liability were reasonable. As a result of this study, in the third
quarter of 2009, 2008 and 2007, management recorded additional expense of
approximately $25million, $13million and $20million as of the
June 30 measurement date, respectively. The Company plans to update its study
again in the third quarter of 2010.
Annual
studies do not include i contaminated sites of which the Company is not aware;
ii additional amounts for third-party tort claims, which arise out of
contaminants allegedly migrating from BNSF property, due to a limited number of
sites; or iii natural resource damage claims. BNSF continues to estimate
third-party tort claims on a site by site basis when the liability for such
claims is probable and reasonably estimable. BNSFs recorded liability for
third-party tort claims as of December 31, 2009, is approximately $13
million.
BNSF is
involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other
mandatory cleanup efforts for 320 sites, including 19 Superfund sites, at which
it is participating in the study or cleanup, or both, of alleged environmental
contamination.

In the
second quarter of 2008, the Company completed an analysis of its Montana sites
to determine its legal exposure related to the potential effect of a Montana
Supreme Court decision. The decision, which did not involve BNSF, held that
restoration damages damages equating to clean-up costs which are intended to
return property to its original condition may be awarded under certain
circumstances even where such damages may exceed the propertys actual value.
The legal situation in Montana, the increase in the number of claims against
BNSF and others resulting from this decision, and the completion of the analysis
caused BNSF to record additional pre-tax environmental expenses of $175 million,
or $031 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008 for environmental
liabilities primarily related to the effect of the aforementioned Montana
Supreme Court decision on certain of BNSFs Montana sites.
In the
first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded additional pre-tax environmental
expenses of $65million, or $011 per share, due to an increase in
environmental costs primarily related to a final resolution with the State of
Washington and its Department of Ecology on clean-up of an existing
environmental site at Skykomish and an adverse reversal of a trial court
decision on appeal regarding a site at Arvin, California.
BNSFs
environmental liabilities are not discounted. BNSF anticipates that the majority
of the accrued costs at December 31, 2009, will be paid over the next ten years,
and no individual site is considered to be material.

Table of Contents
Liabilities
recorded for environmental costs represent BNSFs best estimate of its probable
future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites and include
both asserted and unasserted claims. Although recorded liabilities include
BNSFs best estimate of all probable costs, without reduction for anticipated
recoveries from third parties, BNSFs total cleanup costs at these sites cannot
be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of
corrective actions that may be required, evolving environmental laws and
regulations, advances in environmental technology, the extent of other parties
participation in cleanup efforts, developments in ongoing environmental analyses
related to sites determined to be contaminated and developments in environmental
surveys and studies of contaminated sites.
Because
of the uncertainty surrounding these factors, it is reasonably possible that
future costs for environmental liabilities may range from approximately $370
million to $830 million. However, BNSF believes that the $517 million recorded
at December 31, 2009, is the best estimate of the Companys future obligation
for environmental costs.
Although
the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, it is the opinion of BNSF that none of these items, when finally
resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position or liquidity. However, the occurrence of a number of these items in the
same period could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in
a particular quarter or fiscal year.
Other
Claims and Litigation
In
addition to asbestos, other personal injury and environmental matters discussed
above, BNSF and its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal
actions and claims, governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in
the ordinary course of business, including those related to disputes and
complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges including
complaints seeking refunds of prior charges paid for coal transportation and the
prescription of future rates for such movements and claims relating to service
under contract provisions or otherwise. Some of the legal proceedings include
claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages, and a few proceedings
purport to be class actions. Although the final outcome of these matters cannot
be predicted with certainty, considering among other things the meritorious
legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with
applicable insurance, it is the opinion of BNSF that none of these items, when
finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial
position or liquidity. However, an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more
of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
in a particular quarter or fiscal year.
Coal Rate Case
Decision
On
February 17, 2009, the United States Surface Transportation Board STB issued a
new decision in a rate dispute between Western Fuels Association, Inc. and Basin
Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. collectively, WFA and BNSF Railway Company
BNSF Railway. Western Fuels Association,
Inc. and Basin Electric Power Cooperative v. BNSF Railway Company, STB Docket No. 42088. The dispute relates
to the reasonableness of rates BNSF Railway charges to WFA for the
transportation of approximately 8 million tons of coal a year from Powder River
Basin mines in Wyoming to the Laramie River Station Plant at Moba Junction,
Wyoming. The STB previously ruled in this matter in 2007 that the challenged
rates were not shown unreasonable. During the pendency of the case, the STB
issued new guidelines for reviewing the reasonableness of rates in cases such as
this and then permitted WFA to submit new evidence. In its new 2009 decision,
the STB found that these same challenged rates were not commercially reasonable.
The STB ordered BNSF Railway to reimburse WFA for amounts previously collected
above the new levels prescribed for prior periods. The STB also prescribed
maximum rates through 2024 at levels substantially below the rates previously
set by BNSF Railway. In compliance with the STBs decision, BNSF Railway
published new rates to the Laramie River Station effective March 20, 2009. WFA
challenged BNSF Railways methodology for implementing those rates before the
STB and on July 27, 2009, the STB issued a decision that largely adopted the
methodology advocated for by BNSF Railway. The final amount of approximately
$120 million in reparations, which includes interest, was submitted by WFA to
the STB with BNSF Railways concurrence. The STB approved the final amount of
reparations. BNSF Railway paid the reparations during the fourth quarter of
2009. 
The net
impact in 2009 resulting from the STBs decision was a loss of $74 million, or
$013 per diluted share, in excess of amounts previously accrued. Of the total
loss, $66 million and $8 million were recorded as a reduction to freight
revenues and an increase to interest expense, respectively.

Northern Santa Fe Corporation and its Board of Directors, and in some cases
Berkshire and R Acquisition Company, LLC, are named as defendants in putative
class action lawsuits brought by alleged Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Corporation stockholders challenging the merger described in Part 1, Item 1 of
this Form 10-K. Four stockholder actions were filed in Tarrant County, Texas
the first of which was filed November 3, 2009, three actions were filed in
Dallas County, Texas the first of which was filed November 4, 2009, and five
actions were filed in Delaware Chancery Court the first of which was filed
November 5, 2009. The Tarrant County, Texas actions have been consolidated as
In re: Burlington Northern
Santa Fe Corporation Shareholder Class Action Litigation, Cause No. 348-241465-09. The Dallas County,
Texas actions were consolidated under the action styled Employees Retirement System of the
City of New Orleans v. Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, et al.,
Cause No. 09-14950 and have been abated. Plaintiffs in the Dallas County actions
have taken steps seeking to refile or transfer the actions to Tarrant County.
The Delaware actions have been consolidated as In re: Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Shareholders Litigation, C.A. No. 5043-VCL. 
The
stockholder actions variously allege that Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Corporations directors have breached their fiduciary duties based on
allegations that i the consideration being offered is unfair and inadequate,
ii Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporations directors did not adequately
seek to maximize stockholder value through open bidding or market check
mechanisms, iii the no shop clause and termination fee are onerous devices
designed to discourage a superior offer, iv Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Corporations earnings forecasts were manipulated to drive its stock price down
and thus make the proposed transaction appear more favorable to stockholders
than it truly is, and/or v Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporations
disclosures relating to the proposed transaction have been, or will be,
inadequate and materially misleading. Certain of the stockholder actions also
allege that Berkshire aided and abetted the alleged breaches by Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corporations directors. The stockholder actions seek various
remedies, including enjoining the transaction from being consummated in
accordance with the agreed-upon terms. 
On
January 18, 2010, the parties to the litigation entered into a memorandum of
understanding the memorandum of understanding providing for a settlement of
the litigation, subject to the approval of the Delaware Chancery Court. Pursuant
to the memorandum of understanding, the plaintiffs have withdrawn their
application for preliminary injunctive relief, which was previously scheduled to
be heard in the Delaware Chancery Court on February 3, 2010, and the defendants,
while denying all allegations of wrongdoing and denying that the disclosures in
the proxy statement/prospectus were inadequate, provided the supplemental
disclosures set forth in the Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed on
January 20, 2010. 
The
Company believes these claims are without merit and, if the proposed settlement
is not approved, will vigorously defend any further proceedings seeking to
prosecute these claims. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these
proceedings will have a material effect on its financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity.

Employee
separation liabilities of $77million were included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009, and principally represent the following: i
$75million for deferred benefits payable upon separation or retirement to
certain active conductors, trainmen and locomotive engineers; and ii
$2million for certain non-union employee severance costs. Employee
separation expenses are recorded in materials and other in the Consolidated
Statements of Income. At December 31, 2009, $27million of the remaining
liabilities were included in current liabilities. 
The
deferred benefits payable upon separation or retirement to certain active
conductors, trainmen and locomotive engineers were primarily incurred in
connection with labor agreements reached prior to the business combination of
BNSFs predecessor companies, Burlington Northern Inc. and Santa Fe Pacific
Corporation. These agreements, among other things, reduced train crew sizes and
allowed for more flexible work rules. The majority of the remaining costs will
be paid between 2010 and 2020. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had updated
its estimate and recorded an additional liability of $15million related to
deferred benefits see i above. The remaining costs for the non-union
employee severance costs ii are expected to be paid out between 2010 and
approximately 2021 based on deferral elections made by the affected
employees.

Earnings Per Share 
Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of the Companys
common shares outstanding for the periods shown below. Diluted earnings per
share is based on basic earnings per share adjusted for the effect of potential
common shares outstanding that were dilutive during the period, arising from
employee stock awards and incremental shares calculated using the treasury stock
method. 
Weighted
average stock options totaling 43million, 24million and
22million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share, because the options exercise price
exceeded the average market price of the Companys stock for those
periods.
The
Company adopted authoritative accounting guidance which requires non-vested
shares that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
whether paid or unpaid to be considered participating securities, and
therefore be included in computing earnings per share using the two-class
method. The Company has retrospectively applied the provisions to the financial
information included herein, which resulted in a reduction in both basic
earnings per share and diluted earnings per share of $002 and $004 for the
years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Employment Benefit Plans
BNSF
sponsors a funded, noncontributory qualified pension plan, the BNSF Retirement
Plan, which covers most non-union employees, and an unfunded non-tax-qualified
pension plan, the BNSF Supplemental Retirement Plan, which covers certain
officers and other employees. The benefits under these pension plans are based
on years of credited service and the highest consecutive sixty months of
compensation for the last ten years of salaried employment with BNSF. BNSFs
funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the regulatory minimum
and not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes with
respect to the funded plan.
Certain
salaried employees of BNSF that have met age and years of service requirements
are eligible for life insurance coverage and medical benefits, including
prescription drug coverage, during retirement. This postretirement benefit plan,
referred to as the retiree health and welfare plan, is contributory and provides
benefits to retirees, their covered dependents and beneficiaries. Retiree
contributions are adjusted annually. The plan also contains fixed deductibles,
coinsurance and out-of-pocket limitations. The basic life insurance plan is
noncontributory and covers retirees only. Optional life insurance coverage is
available for some retirees; however, the retiree is responsible for the full
cost. BNSFs policy is to fund benefits payable under the medical and life
insurance plans as they come due. Generally, employees beginning salaried
employment with BNSF subsequent to September 22, 1995, are not eligible for
medical benefits during retirement.
In
September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative accounting guidance related to
employers accounting for defined benefit pension andother postretirement
plans, which requires
the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. This portion
of the new guidance was adopted by the Company on December 31, 2006.
Additionally, the pronouncement eliminates the option for the Company to use a
measurement date prior to the Companys fiscal year-end effective December 31,
2008. This authoritative accounting guidance provides two approaches to
transition to a fiscal year-end measurement date, both of which are to be
applied prospectively. BNSF elected to apply the transition option under which a
15-month measurement was determined as of September 30, 2007 that covered the
period until the fiscal year-end measurement was required on December 31, 2008.
As a result, the Company recorded a $7 million decrease to retained earnings in
January 2008.

At
December 31, 2009, BNSF determined the discount rate by utilizing the Mercer
Yield Curve applied to the future estimated cash flows of the Companys pension
and retiree health and welfare plans. At December 31, 2008, BNSF determined the
discount rate by averaging the Mercer Yield Curve and the Moodys Aa Corporate
bond yield, with the latter measure adjusted to reflect the future estimated
cash flows of the Companys pension and retiree health and welfare plans. BNSF
believes the Mercer Yield Curve is, in general, a better model to determine
discount rates as it utilizes a much larger and more diverse population of
highly rated bonds than the Moodys Aa Corporate bond yield. However, given the
volatility experienced in late 2008, the Company was concerned that some of the
bonds included in the Mercer Yield Curve, such as financial institutions, may
have higher yields because their market risk had not yet fully been reflected in
their credit rating. Therefore, BNSF decided it most appropriate to average the
Mercer Yield Curve with the Moodys Aa Corporate bond yield, which had no
financial institutions in its population. The discount rate used for the 2010
calculation of net benefit cost remained at 575 percent which reflects market
conditions at the December 31, 2009, measurement date. 
68
Table of Contents
The
expected long-term rate of return is the return the Company anticipates earning,
net of plan expenses, over the period that benefits are paid. It reflects the
rate of return on present investments and on expected contributions. In
determining the expected long-term rate of return, BNSF considered the
following: i forward looking capital market forecasts; ii historical returns
for individual asset classes; and iii the impact of active portfolio
management. The expected rate of return on plan assets remained consistent from
2009 to 2010, and the Company does not expect any near-term significant changes
to the current investment allocation of assets. However, unforeseen changes in
the investment markets or other external factors could prompt changes in these
estimates in future years.

The
general investment objective of the BNSF Retirement Plan is to grow the plan
assets in relation to the plan liabilities while prudently managing the risk of
a decrease in the plans assets relative to those liabilities. To meet this
objective, the Companys management has adopted the above asset allocation
ranges. This allows flexibility to accommodate market changes in the asset
classes within defined parameters.
Assets
are primarily managed by external Investment Managers each with a specific asset
class mandate as directed by management. There are currently at least two
Investment Managers in each of the above asset classes.
Concentration
in a single security or credit issuer is generally limited to 5% of each
Investment Managers portfolio excluding U.S. government and agencies,
authorized commingled funds, and other manager specific exceptions as authorized
by management. Real estate investment trust investments may not exceed 10% of
any equity managers portfolio.
The Fixed
Income allocation may include Core, Core Plus, and/or Long Duration
portfolios.Plus strategies higher risk investments such as high
yield, emerging markets, and non-dollar denominated securities are limited to
30% of the Core Plus portfolio value.
Real
Estate is generally accessed through direct investment in one or more commingled
funds with reasonable diversification by property type and geographic
location.
Derivative
investments are permitted under certain circumstances.
69
Table of Contents
Investments
are stated at fair value. The various types of investments are valued as
follows: i Equity securities are valued at the last trade price at primary
exchange close time on the last business day of the year Level 1 input. If the
last trade price is not available, values are based on bid, ask/offer quotes
from contracted pricing vendors, brokers, or investment managers Level 3
input. ii Corporate debt securities, government debt securities, and
collateralized obligations and mortgage backed securities are valued based on
institutional bid evaluations from contracted vendors. Where available, vendors
use observable market-based data to evaluate prices Level 2 input. This also
applies to U.S. Treasury securities included in cash and cash equivalents. If
observable market-based data is not available, unobservable inputs such as
extrapolated data, proprietary models, and indicative quotes are used to arrive
at estimated prices representing the price a dealer would pay for the security
Level 3 input. iii Shares of real estate commingled funds are valued at the
quarterly net asset value of units held at year end. Net asset value is based on
independent appraisals obtained at least annually for each property and is
considered a Level 3 input as the funds impose ongoing limitations on the
availability of share redemptions. iv Registered investment companies are
valued at the daily net asset value of shares held at year end. Net asset value
is considered a Level 1 input if redemptions at this value are available to all
shareholders without restriction. Net asset value is considered a Level 2 input
if the fund may restrict share redemptions under limited circumstances. Net
asset value is considered a Level 3 input if shares could not be redeemed on the
reporting date and net asset value can not be corroborated by trading activity.

Defined Contribution
Plans
BNSF
sponsors qualified 401k plans that cover substantially all employees and a
non-qualified defined contribution plan that covers certain officers and other
employees. BNSF matches 50 percent of the first six percent of non-union
employees contributions and matches 25 percent on the first four percent of a
limited number of union employees contributions, which are subject to certain
percentage limits of the employees earnings, at each pay period. Non-union
employees are eligible to receive an annual discretionary matching contribution
of up to 30 percent of the first six percent of their contributions. Employer
contributions for all non-union employees are subject to a five-year length of
service vesting schedule. BNSFs 401k matching expense was $22 million 29million and $21million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
Other
Under
collective bargaining agreements, BNSF participates in multi-employer benefit
plans that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for eligible union employees. Insurance premiums paid attributable to
retirees, which are generally expensed as incurred, were $54 million 54million and $46million, in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively see
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for other deferred benefits
payable to certain conductors, trainmen and locomotive engineers.

Stock-Based Compensation
On April
15, 1999, BNSF shareholders approved the Burlington Northern Santa Fe 1999 Stock
Incentive Plan and authorized 20million shares of BNSF common stock to be
issued in connection with stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and performance stock. On April 18, 2001, April 17, 2002, April 21, 2004
and April 19, 2006, BNSF shareholders approved the amendments to the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, which authorized additional awards
of 9million, 6million, 7million and 11million shares,
respectively, of BNSF common stock to be issued in connection with stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance stock.
Approximately 5 million common shares were available for future grant at
December 31, 2009.
Additionally,
on April 18, 1996, BNSF shareholders approved the non-employee directors stock
plan and authorized 900,000 shares of BNSF common stock to be issued in
connection with this plan. Approximately 403,000 common shares were available
for future grant at December 31, 2009.
Upon
completion of the proposedMerger, no further grants of BNSF stock will be
made under the BNSF stock-based compensation plans. See Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the proposed
Merger. 
Stock
Options
Under
BNSFs stock plans, options were granted to directors, officers and salaried
employees at the fair market value of BNSFs common stock on the date of grant.
Stock option grants generally vest ratably over three years and expire within
ten years after the date of grant. Shares issued upon exercise of options may be
issued from treasury shares or from authorized but unissued shares.

Expected
volatilities are based on historical volatility of BNSFs stock, implied
volatilities from traded options on BNSFs stock and other factors. The Company
uses historical experience with exercise and post-vesting employment termination
behavior to determine the options expected life. The expected life represents
the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The
risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rate with a maturity date
corresponding to the options expected life.

Time-based
awards were granted to senior managers within BNSF primarily as a retention tool
and to encourage ownership in BNSF. They generally vest over three years,
although in some cases up to five years, and are contingent on continued
salaried employment. 
Performance-based
units were granted to senior managers within BNSF to encourage ownership in BNSF
and to align managements interest with those of its shareholders.
Performance-based units generally vest over three years and are contingent on
the achievement of certain predetermined corporate performance goals e.g.,
return on invested capital ROIC and continued salaried employment.
Additionally,
eligible employees could earn performance stock contingent upon achievement of
higher ROIC goals and continued salaried employment. 
Certain
employees were eligible to exchange through the Burlington Northern Santa Fe
Incentive Bonus Stock Program the cash payment of their bonus for grants of
restricted stock. In September 2005, the program was amended so that exchanges
of cash bonus payments for awards of restricted stock were no longer permitted
after February 2006. 
Certain
other salaried employees were eligible to participate in the BNSF Discounted
Stock Purchase Program and use their bonus to purchase shares of BNSF common
stock at a discount from the market price. These shares immediately vest but are
restricted for a three-year period. This program was terminated in December
2009.
Shares
awarded under each of the plans may not be sold or used as collateral and are
generally not transferable by the holder until the shares awarded become free of
restrictions. Compensation cost, net of tax, recorded under the BNSF Stock
Incentive Plans is shown in the following table in millions:

At
December 31, 2009, there was $89 million of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 158 years. 
Upon
completion of the proposed Merger, each outstanding stock option or share award
of BNSF common stock will be converted into an option or restricted stock unit
of Berkshire Class B Common Stock, in accordance with a formula to convert such
awards.

Common Stock and Preferred Capital Stock
Common
Stock
BNSF is
authorized to issue 600million shares of common stock, $001 par value. At
December 31, 2009, there were 341million shares of common stock
outstanding. Each holder of common stock is entitled to one vote per share in
the election of directors and on all matters submitted to a vote of
shareholders. Subject to the rights and preferences of any future issuances of
preferred stock, each share of common stock is entitled to receive dividends as
may be declared by the Board out of funds legally available and to share ratably
in all assets available for distribution to shareholders upon dissolution or
liquidation. No holder of common stock has any preemptive right to subscribe for
any securities of BNSF. Upon completion of the proposed Merger, shares of
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation common stock will no longer be
available for issuance. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
information related to the proposed Merger.

Table of Contents
Preferred Capital
Stock
At
December 31, 2009, BNSF had 50million shares of Class A Preferred Stock 001 par value and 25 million shares of preferred stock, $001 par value
available for issuance. The Board has the authority to issue such stock in one
or more series, to fix the number of shares and to fix the designations and the
powers, rights and qualifications and restrictions of each series. As of
December 31, 2009, no shares of Class A Preferred Stock had been issued. Upon
completion of the proposed Merger, shares of Class A Preferred Stock will no
longer beavailable for issuance. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for information related to the proposed Merger.
Share Repurchase
Program
In
February 2007, the Board authorized the extension of the current BNSF share
repurchase program, adding 30million shares to the total of
180million shares previously authorized in equal amounts in July 1997,
December 1999, April 2000, September 2000, January 2003 and December 2005. The
Company did not repurchase shares related to its share repurchase program during
2009. During 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased approximately
12million and 15million shares, respectively, of its common stock at
average prices of $9296 per share and $8396 per share, respectively. Total
repurchases through December 31, 2009, were 192million shares at a total
average cost of $4153 per share, leaving 18million shares available for
repurchase out of the 210million shares presently authorized. During 2009
and apart from the share repurchase program, the Company repurchased shares from
employees at a cost of $16million to satisfy tax withholding obligations
on the vesting of restricted stock or the exercise of stock options. Upon
completion of the proposed Merger, the share repurchase program will be
terminated. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information
related to the proposed Merger.
16.
Accounting Pronouncements
In June
2009, the FASB amended authoritative accounting guidance related to transfers of
financial assets which updates existing guidance. The amended authoritative
accounting guidance limits the circumstances in which financial assets can be
derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial
assets and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred financial
assets. The amended authoritative accounting guidance also eliminates the
concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity QSPE, which will require
companies to evaluate former QSPEs for consolidation.
In June
2009, the FASB amended authoritative accounting guidance related to the
consolidation of variable interest entities VIEs. The amended authoritative
accounting guidance updates existing guidance used to determine whether or not a
company is required to consolidate a VIE and requires enhanced disclosures. The
amended authoritative accounting guidance also eliminates quantitative-based
assessments and will require companies to perform ongoing qualitative
assessments to determine whether or not the VIE should be
consolidated.
The
Company adopted the amended authoritative accounting guidance on January 1,
2010. 
As
discussed in Note 6, the Companys A/R sales program involves a master trust
that issues an undivided interest in receivables to investors. The A/R sales
master trust is not currently consolidated in the Companys financial statements
and the undivided interest in receivables that have been sold to investors is
derecognized. The amended authoritative accounting guidance will require the
Company to consolidate the A/R sales master trust and to no longer derecognize
the undivided interest sold to investors effective January 1, 2010. The Company
intends to apply this guidance prospectively. As a result, the Companys
Consolidated Balance Sheets will reflect an increase in accounts receivable, net
and an increase in current liabilities for the amount of undivided interests
sold to investors and any related cash flow impacts will be included in
Financing Activities rather than Operating Activities in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. There were no outstanding undivided interests held by
investors under the A/R sales program at December 31, 2009. Outstanding
undivided interests held by investors under the A/R sales program were $50
million at December 31, 2008.
The
Company did not record any additional financial statement adjustments as a
result of the adoption of the amended authoritative accounting
guidance.
