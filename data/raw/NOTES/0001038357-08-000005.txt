East Cameron 322 facility.
International
The Company international operations are located offshore South Africa
and onshore in southern Tunisia. Additionally, the Company has an exploration permit in
Equatorial Guinea. During 2007, the Company also disposed of its interests in Block 320
in Nigeria, and relinquished its remaining interest in Block 256 in Nigeria due to
unsuccessful exploratory drilling results. The Company is currently winding up its
efforts to exit Nigeria completely. In November 2007, the Company closed the sale of
all of the Company common stock in its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of
$5257 million, resulting in a gain of $1013 million. See Notes N, S and V of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for a description of the Nigerian and Canadian divestitures. As of
December 31, 2007, approximately three percent of the Company proved reserves were
located in Africa.

Includes $105 million of capitalized interest related
to the South Coast Gas project.
South Africa. The Company has
agreements to explore for oil and gas covering over 36 million acres offshore the
southern coast of South Africa in water depths generally less than 650 feet. The Sable
oil field began producing in August 2003 and the majority of the gas from the field has
been reinjected. The Company has a 40 percent working interest in the Sable
field.
In 2005, the Company sanctioned the non-operated South Coast Gas
development project, which includes the subsea tie-back of gas from the Sable field and
five additional gas accumulations to an existing production facility on the F-A
platform for transportation via existing pipelines to a gas-to-liquids plant. Pioneer
has a 45 percent working interest in the project. As part of sanctioning of the South
Coast Gas project, the Company signed a six-year contract for the sale of all of its
gas and condensate production from the project. The contract contains an obligation for
the purchaser to take or pay for a total of 914 BCF and associated condensate if the
anticipated deliverability estimates are achieved. The price for both gas and
condensate is indexed to Brent oil prices. During 2007, two additional wells were
drilled and installation of pipeline and facilities infrastructure was completed as
part of the South Coast Gas project. First production from the South Coast Gas project
was achieved in the third quarter of 2007 at approximately 15 to 20 MMcfpd gross. It
is expected that the simultaneous production of both oil and gas from the Sable field
will increase the ultimately recoverable oil reserves.
A significant portion of the gas reserves associated with the South
Coast Gas project is in the Sable field. Initially, the gas production from the Sable
field was not expected to commence until the oil production was completed. However, as
a result of production performance from the Sable field and improved oil prices, which
have had the effect of extending the economic life of the Sable oil field, facilities
modifications are being planned that would allow for the simultaneous production of oil
and gas from the Sable field. The modifications are currently expected to be completed
in late 2008 or early 2009.
27
Tunisia. The Company holds interests
in four separate onshore permits located in the southern portion of Tunisia. These
permits cover a gross area of approximately 11,900 square kilometers containing two
production concessions targeting the Acacus formation with additional future upside
exploration potential from this and other formations.
Jenein Nord Permit and Cherouq Concession.
The Jenein Nord Permit covers approximately 1,200 square
kilometers. Over the past two years, the Company has conducted an
intensive exploration program over the area. As a result of an
aggressive seismic data acquisition and exploration drilling program,
the Company achieved a significant number of hydrocarbon discoveries.
Based on the success, the Company, along with the government oil
agency, Enterprise Tunisienne d'Activities Petrolieres ETAP,
submitted a joint application on November 10, 2007 to the Directeur
Gnral de l'Energie for the development of a portion of
the permit area called the Cherouq Concession.
On December 17, 2007, the Consultative Committee of Hydrocarbons, the
advisory committee to the Directeur Gnral de l'Energie, approved the
Cherouq Concession resulting in the Company and ETAP each holding a 50 percent working
interest in the concession. The concession covers approximately 760 square kilometers
of the Jenein Nord Permit. During 2007, the Company drilled seven exploration wells and
first production from the concession was achieved in late fourth quarter
2007.
The Company plans to drill up to seven additional wells and acquire an
additional 295 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data over the Cherouq Concession during
2008.
Borj El Khadra Permit and Adam Concession.
The Borj El Khadra Permit, including the Adam
Concession, covers approximately 2,900 square kilometers. Production
from the Adam Concession began in May 2003, for which the Company now
has a 20 percent working interest. During 2007, the Company continued
its exploratory and appraisal activities on the Adam Concession by
drilling four wells, of which all were successful, and completed
drilling of two wells in the Borj El Khadra Permit, of which one was
successful. The Company plans to drill an additional four wells in the
Adam Concession and two wells in the Borj El Khadra exploration permit
during 2008.
El Hamra Permit. The El
Hamra exploration permit covers approximately 4,000 square kilometers,
of which the Company is operator with a 50 percent working interest
during the exploration period. In 2007, the Company completed the
acquisition of 310 kilometers of seismic data and began processing the
data. Processing and interpretation of the seismic data is scheduled to
be completed during the second quarter of 2008. The Company anticipates
drilling an exploration well in the second half of 2008.
Anaguid Permit. The Anaguid
exploration permit covers approximately 3,800 square kilometers. In
2007, the Company acquired an additional 15 percent interest in the
Anaguid exploration permit, thereby increasing its interest to 60
percent during the exploration period and resulting in the transfer
of operations to Pioneer. The Company intends to acquire an additional
900 square kilometers of 3-D seismic data and expects to drill up to
two exploration wells in the second half of 2008.
Equatorial Guinea. The Company owns
a 50 percent interest in Block H in deepwater Equatorial Guinea, which covers over
240,000 acres. In late 2006, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea ratified a new
hydrocarbons law, which among other things, appears to entitle Equatorial Guinea to
increase substantially its carried interest in all concessions, including Block H. In
addition, drilling costs have increased significantly beyond those originally
anticipated. Given these and other facts, the Company and the other participants in the
block have been unable to reach an agreement as to their respective rights and
obligations under a joint operating agreement relating to the well operations in the
block and as a result, the parties have commenced arbitration. In connection with the
ongoing arbitration among the parties, the Company recognized an impairment charge of
approximately $103 million to write off its remaining basis in Block H. See Note I of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for specific information regarding the Company arbitration
associated with Block H.

Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells
capable of production, including shut-in wells. One or more completions
in the same well bore are counted as one well. If any well in which one
of the multiple completions is an oil completion, then the well is
classified as an oil well. As of December 31, 2007, the Company owned
interests in seven gross wells containing multiple
completions.

Acres subject to expiration during 2008 include 827,308
gross acres 201,341 net acres in Tunisia and 198,889 gross acres
153,427 net acres in North America. In Tunisia, the Company has
received extensions, plans to make the necessary expenditures to extend
the acreage or intends to seek extensions on the 2008 expirations. As
to the remaining acreage, the Company may extend the leases prior to
their expiration based upon 2008 planned activities or for other
business reasons. In certain leases, the extension is only subject to
the Company election to extend and the fulfillment of certain capital
expenditures commitments. In other cases, the extensions are subject to
the consent of third parties, and no assurance can be given that the
requested extensions will be granted. See Description of Properties
above for information regarding the Company drilling
operations.
Drilling activities. The following
table sets forth the number of gross and net productive and dry hole wells in which the
Company had an interest that were drilled during 2007, 2006 and 2005. This information
should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed
that there was any correlation between the number of productive wells drilled and the
oil and gas reserves generated thereby or the costs to the Company of productive wells
compared to the costs of dry holes.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Financial and Operating Performance
Pioneer financial and operating performance for 2007
included the following highlights:
As a result of the gain recognized on the sale of
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets during 2006, partially
offset by the gain recognized on the Canadian divestiture in 2007, net
income decreased 50 percent to $3727 million $306 per diluted share
in 2007 from $7397 million $581 per diluted share in
2006.
Income from continuing operations increased to $2420
million $199 per diluted share for 2007, as compared to $1502
million $119 per diluted share for 2006, primarily due to higher oil
and gas revenues.
Average daily sales volumes, on a BOE basis, increased
eight percent in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to successful
drilling programs and a five percent decrease in the delivery of VPP
volumes.
Oil and gas revenues increased $2819 million, or 19
percent in 2007, as compared to 2006, due to a combination of increased
production and increases in worldwide commodity prices.
The Company completed the divestiture of the Company
Canadian subsidiary for net proceeds of $5257 million, resulting in a
gain of $1013 million.
The Company recognized income from discontinued
operations of $1307 million $107 per diluted share during 2007,
primarily attributable to the sale of Canadian assets, as compared to
income from discontinued operations of $5895 million $462 per
diluted share during 2006, which included the sale of the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
$205 million, or three percent as compared to that of 2006, primarily
due to increased sales volumes, increased commodity prices and $749
million of income realized from the disposal of Alaskan PPT credits,
offset by the cash provided by operating activities associated with the
2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and the
2007 disposal of the Canadian assets.
The Company added 1479 MMBOE of proved reserves during
2007, resulting in total proved reserves of 9638 MMBOE at December 31,
2007.
The Company commenced production at the South Coast Gas
Project in South Africa late in the third quarter of 2007.
The construction and installation of facilities at the
Company Alaskan Oooguruk project was completed and drilling was
initiated in December 2007 with first production on schedule for the
first half of 2008, with first sales expected mid 2008.
The Company acquired oil and gas properties that
complemented the Company exploration and development drilling
activities with significant acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Raton
field and the Barnett Shale play of approximately $439
million.
39
2008
Outlook and Activities
Commodity prices. Significant
factors that may impact future commodity prices include: developments in the issues
currently impacting Iraq and Iran and the Middle East in general; the extent to which
members of the OPEC and other oil exporting nations are able to continue to manage oil
supply through export quotas; and overall North American gas supply and demand
fundamentals, including the impact of weather conditions and increasing LNG deliveries
to the United States. Although the Company cannot predict the occurrence of events that
may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be
affected, the prices for any commodity that the Company produces will generally
approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time
to time, Pioneer expects that it may hedge a portion of its commodity price risk to
mitigate the impact of price volatility on its oil, NGL and gas revenues. See Note J of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company commodity
hedge positions at December 31, 2007. Also see Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk for disclosures about the Company commodity related
derivative financial instruments.
Capital budget for 2008. The Company
announced a 2008 capital budget of $10 billion, excluding acquisitions, effects of
asset retirement obligations, capitalized interest and geological and geophysical
administrative costs. The 2008 capital budget is significantly less than 2007 capital
spending levels, excluding acquisitions, due to the completion of facilities
construction for both the South Coast Gas project off the coast of South Africa and the
Oooguruk project on the North Slope of Alaska, the sale of all Canadian assets and the
elimination of higher-risk exploration. Approximately 90 percent of the 2008 capital
budget will be focused on low-risk development drilling and resource play extensions in
Pioneer four core onshore areas Spraberry, Raton, Edwards Trend and Tunisia. The
remaining ten percent will be focused primarily on development drilling in the Oooguruk
project and Barnett Shale drilling. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash
flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the $10 billion capital
budget.
2008 Annual
Production.The Company
believes that the results from its 2007 drilling program and 2008 capital budget will
allow the Company to realize production growth per share during 2008 of 12 percent or
more as compared to the Company 2007 production per share.
First Quarter 2008 Outlook. Based on
current estimates, the Company expects that first quarter 2008 production will average
103,000 to 109,000 BOEPD. The range reflects the typical variability in the timing of
oil cargo shipments in South Africa and Tunisia.
First quarter production costs including production and ad valorem
taxes and transportation costs are expected to average $1175 to $1275 per BOE based
on NYMEX strip prices for oil, NGLs and gas at the time of the estimate. Depletion,
depreciation and amortization DDA expense is expected to average $1075 to
$1175 per BOE.
Total exploration and abandonment expense for the quarter is expected to
be $40 million to $70 million including i up to $40 million from activities in the
Company resource plays in the Edwards Trend in South Texas, the Rockies area and
Tunisia and ii up to $30 million in seismic investments and personnel costs,
primarily in the Edwards Trend and Tunisia resource plays. General and administrative
expense is expected to be $32 million to $36 million. Interest expense is expected to
be $35 million to $40 million. Accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations is
expected to be $2 million to $3 million.
The Company first quarter effective income tax rate is expected to
range from 40 percent to 45 percent based on current capital spending plans and higher
tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions. Cash income taxes are expected to range
from $10 million to $15 million, principally related to Tunisian income
taxes.
Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Initial Public
Offering. On January 8, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy
Partners L.P. Pioneer Southwest, a subsidiary of the Company, filed an amendment to
its registration statement subject to completion with the SEC to sell limited partner
interests. If the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in
certain oil and gas properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in
the Permian Basin of West Texas. Pioneer Southwest registration statement
contemplates an offering of 7,500,000 common units representing a 353 percent limited
partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. Upon completion of this offering, the Company
would own a 01 percent general partner interest and a 646 percent limited partner
interest in Pioneer Southwest. The underwriters would be granted a 30-day option to
purchase up to 1,125,000 additional common units. The Company limited partner
interest would be reduced to 614 percent if the
40
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. Assuming an
initial public offering price of $2000 per common unit and that the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option, estimated gross proceeds from the offering would
be $150 million. In February 2008, the Company announced that the initial public
offering of common units of Pioneer Southwest has been postponed due to market
conditions and timing of the offering remains uncertain. There can be no assurance that
Pioneer Southwest will complete the offering, or if completed, that the offering will
be structured as described above.
This report shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy any securities of Pioneer Southwest. Any offers, solicitations of
offers to buy, or any sales of securities of Pioneer Southwest will be made only in
accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an
exemption therefrom.
Acquisitions
2007 acquisition expenditures.
During 2007, the Company spent approximately $5367 million to acquire
proved and unproved properties. The acquisitions primarily added proved reserves and
increased the Company acreage positions in the Spraberry field, Raton field and
Barnett Shale play.
2006 acquisition expenditures.
During 2006, the Company spent approximately $2232 million to acquire
proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $1448 million of
proved properties and $783 million of unproved properties. The proved properties were
primarily bolt-on and acreage acquisitions in the Spraberry field and Edwards Trend
area. In North America, the acquisition of unproved properties is comprised of acreage
acquisitions in the Spraberry field, Edwards Trend area, Rockies area, Alaska and
Canada. The Company also acquired an additional interest in its Jenein Nord block in
Tunisia and recognized additional obligations associated with its Nigerian prospects
during 2006.
2005 acquisition expenditures.
During 2005, the Company spent approximately $2729 million to acquire
proved and unproved properties, which was comprised of approximately $1734 million of
proved properties and approximately $995 million of unproved properties.
Divestitures
Canada. In November 2007, the
Company sold its Canadian subsidiaries for $5257 million, resulting in a gain of
$1013 million. The historic results of these assets and the related gain on
disposition are reported as discontinued operations.
Nigeria. In prior years, a
subsidiary of the Company joined other companies in a production sharing contract
covering the oil prospecting license for Block 320 in deepwater Nigeria, gaining
exploration rights from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. During the third
quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of all its shares in the subsidiary holding Block
320. As a result of the disposition of the shares in the Nigerian subsidiary, the
Company no longer owns any interest in Block 320 and will not fund or participate in
any future operations in connection with Block 320.
Argentina and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
During March 2006, the Company sold its interests in certain oil and gas
properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $12 billion, resulting
in a gain of $7253 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its Argentine assets
for net proceeds of $6696 million, resulting in a gain of $109 million. The historic
results of these properties and the related gains on disposition are reported as
discontinued operations.
Volumetric production payments.
During 2005, the Company sold 278 MMBOE of proved reserves in the
Hugoton and Spraberry fields, by means of three VPPs for net proceeds of $8926
million, including the assignment of the Company obligations under certain derivative
hedge agreements.
The Company VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests
in oil and gas reserves that: i entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
over a period of time from specific lease interests; ii are free and clear of all
associated future production costs and capital expenditures; iii are nonrecourse to
the Company i.e., the purchaser only recourse is to the reserves acquired; iv
transfers title of the reserves to the purchaser and v allows the Company to retain
the remaining reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered. Based
on the scheduled production deliveries, the multiple VPPs are scheduled to be completed
between 2009 and 2012.
41
Canada and Shelf Gulf of Mexico.
During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek and
Conroy Black areas of northeast British Columbia and the Lookout Butte area of southern
Alberta for net proceeds of $1972 million, resulting in a gain of $1383 million.
During 2005, the Company also sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas
properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $592 million, resulting in
a gain of $279 million. The historic results of these properties and the related gains
on disposition are reported as discontinued operations.
Gabon divestiture. In 2005, the
Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owns the interest
in the Olowi block for $479 million of net proceeds, resulting in a gain of $475
million with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States.
During 2007, Pioneer relinquished its rights to receive additional payments for
production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block in consideration for a
release of certain obligations.
Results of Operations
Oil and gas revenues. Oil and gas
revenues totaled $17 billion, $15 billion and $13 billion during 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The revenue increase during 2007, as compared to 2006, was
primarily reflective of increases in United States and Tunisian revenues, partially
offset by decreases in South African revenues. The increase in United States revenues
was primarily due to an increase in average daily sales volumes resulting from
successful drilling programs and reductions in scheduled volumetric production payment
VPP deliveries, combined with an 18 percent increase in reported NGL prices and an
18 percent increase in reported gas prices. The increase in Tunisian revenues resulted
from an increase in average daily sales volumes from successful drilling efforts and a
12 percent increase in average reported prices. South African revenues declined due to
normal production decline rates in the Sable field and the timing of oil cargo
liftings, partially offset by increases in average reported oil prices and initial gas
production from the South Coast Gas project. The revenue increase during 2006, as
compared to 2005, was due to a 70 percent increase in reported oil prices and an 11
percent increase in NGL prices. Partially offsetting the effects of increased oil and
NGL prices was an 11 percent decrease in reported gas prices and a four percent
decrease in average daily sales volumes on a BOE basis.
A significant factor contributing to the increases in reported oil
prices and decreases in reported oil sales volumes in 2006 as compared to 2005 was the
initiation of first deliveries of oil volumes under the Company VPP agreements in
January 2006. VPP gas deliveries were initiated during February 2005 and declined by
three percent during 2006, as compared to that of 2005. In accordance with GAAP, VPP
deliveries result in VPP deferred revenue amortization being recognized in oil and gas
revenues with no associated sales volumes being recorded.
The following table provides average daily sales volumes from continuing
operations by geographic area and in total, for 2007, 2006 and 2005

production for 2006, as compared to 2005, decreased by one percent in the United
States, by 37 percent in South Africa and by 26 percent in Tunisia.
During the year ended December 31, 2007, oil and gas volumes delivered
under the Company VPPs decreased by five percent, as compared to 2006.

Hedging activities. The Company,
from time to time, utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts in order to i reduce
the effect of price volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, ii
support the Company annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce
commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects. During 2007, 2006 and
2005, the Company commodity price hedges decreased oil and gas revenues from
continuing operations by $835 million, $1512 million and $2848 million,
respectively. The effective portions of changes in the fair values of the Company
commodity price hedges are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders' equity
until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. Consequently, changes in the effective
portions of commodity price hedges add volatility to the Company reported
stockholders' equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated. See Note J of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for information concerning the impact to oil and gas revenues
during 2007, 2006 and 2005 from the Company hedging activities, the Company open
and terminated hedge positions at December 31, 2007 and descriptions of the Company
commodity hedge derivatives. Also see
44
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
for additional disclosures about the Company commodity related derivative financial
instruments.
Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company entered into additional
commodity swap contracts for approximately 69,945 MMBtu per day of the Company 2008
production at an average price of $728 per MMBtu. See Note J of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
for information concerning these changes in gas hedge positions.
Deferred revenue.
During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognition of previously
deferred VPP revenue increased oil and gas revenues from continuing operations by
$1812 million, $1903 million and $758 million, respectively. The Company
amortization of deferred VPP revenue is scheduled to increase 2008 oil and gas revenues
by $1581 million. See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for specific information
regarding the Company VPPs.
Interest and other income. The
Company interest and other income totaled $947 million, $484 million and $265
million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The $463 million increase during
2007, as compared to 2006, is primarily attributable to i $749 million of 2007
Alaskan Petroleum Production Tax PPT credit dispositions and ii a $48 million
2007 royalty obligation accrual adjustment, partially offset by iii an $113 million
decrease in interest income, iv a $76 million reduction in business interruption
insurance claims and v a $74 million decrease in derivative ineffectiveness income.
The $219 million increase during 2006, as compared to 2005, is primarily attributable
to i a $129 million increase in interest income primarily attributable to the
investing the proceeds from the Argentine and deepwater Gulf of Mexico divestitures
during 2006, ii $74 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains recorded during 2006 and
iii $56 million of Alaskan exploration incentive credits received in 2006, offset by
iv a $66 million decrease in business interruption insurance claims primarily
attributable to the 2005 Fain plant fire in the West Panhandle field.
In 2006, Alaska replaced its severance tax with the PPT for periods
beginning after March 31, 2006. In late 2007, Alaska made further changes to the PPT
through legislation referred to as Alaska Clear and Equitable Share ACES. The
ACES modifications to PPT were effective as of July 1, 2007. Due to the Company
expenditures in Alaska and having no current production, the Company has generated PPT
related carryforwards. At December 31, 2007, the Company had approximately $90 million
of available PPT related carryforwards that may be monetized in the future. The Company
anticipates recognizing further benefits from the PPT related carryforwards from i a
reduction in PPT liabilities or ii sales of the carryforwards to third parties, if
transferable, or reimbursement from the State of Alaska. The Company anticipates that
any transfers of PPT related carryforwards to third parties would be at a discounted
value, for which the amount of discount is currently not known.
Gain loss on disposition of assets.
The Company recorded a net loss on disposition of assets of $22 million
in 2007, as compared to a net loss of $65 million in 2006 and a net gain of $601
million during 2005.
In 2005, the gain was primarily related to i the sale of the stock of
a subsidiary that owned the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon, which resulted in a
$475 million gain and ii a $14 million property insurance settlement on the
Company East Cameron facility that was destroyed by Hurricane Rita, which resulted in
a $97 million gain.
During 2007, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of its Canadian
assets of $1013 million. During 2006, the Company recognized gains on the sale of its
interest in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its
Argentina assets of approximately $7362 million. During 2005, the Company recognized
gains on the sale of certain assets in Canada and the shelf of the Gulf of Mexico of
approximately $1662 million. However, pursuant to SFAS 144, these gains and the
results of operations from the assets are presented as discontinued
operations.
The net cash proceeds from asset divestitures during 2007, 2006 and 2005
were used, together with net cash flows provided by operating activities, to fund
additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchase programs, and to reduce
outstanding indebtedness. See Notes N and V of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Oil and gas production costs. The
Company oil and gas production costs totaled $4207 million, $3491 million and
$3097 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In general, lease operating
expenses and workover expenses represent the components of oil and gas production costs
over which the Company has management control, while production taxes and ad valorem
taxes are directly related to commodity price changes.
45
Total production costs per BOE increased during 2007 by 12 percent as
compared to 2006 primarily due to i general inflation of field service and supply
costs associated with rising commodity prices, ii increased repair and clean up
costs, and associated production downtime, from severe weather conditions that affected
certain areas of the Company United States operations during the first quarter of
2007, iii increased workover activity and iv fixed production costs associated with
declining South African Sable oil production.
Total production costs per BOE increased during 2006 by 18 percent as
compared to 2005 primarily due to i the impact of a 126 percent increase in delivered
volumes under VPP agreements, for which the Company bears all associated production
costs and records no associated sales volumes representing a per BOE production cost
impact of approximately $150 during 2006 as compared to $59 during 2005, ii
general inflation of field service and supply costs and iii increases in production
and ad valorem taxes and field utility costs due to increasing commodity and utility
prices.
The following tables provide the components of the Company total
production costs per BOE and total production costs per BOE by geographic area for
2007, 2006 and 2005

Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense.
The Company total DDA expense was $1090, $952 and $776 per BOE
for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Depletion expense, the largest component of
DDA expense, was $1010, $880 and $719 per BOE during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. During 2007, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due
to i a generally increasing trend in the Company oil and gas properties' cost bases
per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in
drilling rig rates and drilling supplies and ii first production of the South Coast
gas project in South Africa, which has a higher depletion rate.
During 2006, the increase in per BOE depletion expense was primarily due
to i a generally increasing trend in the Company oil and gas properties' cost bases
per BOE of proved and proved developed reserves as a result of cost inflation in
drilling rig rates and drilling supplies, ii the sale of proved reserves under VPP
agreements, for which the Company removed proved reserves with no corresponding
decrease in cost basis, iii a $50 per BOE increase in Tunisian depletion, primarily
associated with 2006 and 2005 decreases in the Company interest in the Adam
Concession, offset by iv a $391 per BOE decrease in South Africa depletion,
primarily associated with 2006 and 2005 positive revisions to proved reserves based on
well performance.

Impairment of long-lived assets. The
Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including oil and gas
properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those
assets may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
recognized aggregate noncash impairment charges of $262 million. During 2007, the
Company recorded a charge of $103 million to write off the Company remaining basis
in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was recorded in connection with the ongoing
arbitration among the parties participating in the Block H prospect. Another $102
million of the impairment charges relate to the Company announced intent to dispose
of its Nigerian subsidiary that held the interest in Block 320 and the resulting
adjustment to reduce its carrying cost basis to Block 320 estimated fair value.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company also recognized a $57 million
impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain oil and gas properties
located in Louisiana due to poor well performance.
During 2005, the Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644
thousand to reduce the carrying value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development
of the discovery was canceled. See Critical Accounting Estimates below and Notes B
and S of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information pertaining to the
Company accounting policies regarding assessments of impairment and the Equatorial
Guinea, Nigeria, Louisiana and Gabonese Olowi field impairments.

During 2007, significant components of the Company exploratory dry
hole provisions and leasehold abandonments expense included: i $721 million of
suspended well costs written off due to the discontinuation of the Clipper project in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to increasing costs, ii $138 million of costs
associated with the Company unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 offshore
Nigeria, iii $508 million for costs
47
associated with two unsuccessful exploratory wells in the Company
Alaskan NPRA area and the write-off of the remaining prospect costs in the onshore
North Slope area and iv $139 million of Tunisian dry hole provisions and abandonment
costs, which primarily related to the write-off of a suspended well drilled in 2003 on
the Anaguid permit and an unsuccessful exploratory well in both the Jenein Nord permit
and the Borj El Khadra permit. During 2007, the Company seismic activity primarily
related to its resource plays in South Texas and the Rocky Mountains. During 2007, the
Company completed and evaluated 76 exploration/extension wells, 60 of which were
successfully completed as discoveries.
During 2006, significant components of the Company dry hole provisions
and leasehold abandonments expense included i $340 million of costs associated with
the Company unsuccessful exploratory well on its Block 256 prospect offshore Nigeria,
including $178 million of associated unproved leasehold impairment, ii $216 million
of dry hole provisions recorded for the Company unsuccessful Cronus, Storms and
Antigua prospects in the North Slope area of Alaska, iii $169 million of dry hole
provisions and abandonment costs recognized on prospects drilled in prior periods that
were being evaluated for commerciality, including $72 million of costs associated with
the Company Boomslang prospect offshore South Africa, $55 million of costs
associated with two discoveries on the Gulf of Mexico shelf in 2005 and $42 million of
costs associated with the Company Anaguid permit in Tunisia, iv $160 million of
dry hole provision and unproved property impairment recognized on the Company
unsuccessful Norphlet prospect in Mississippi and v a $143 million unsuccessful well
on the Company Flying Cloud prospect in the Gulf of Mexico. During 2006, the Company
completed and evaluated 414 exploration/extension wells, 384 of which were successfully
completed as discoveries.
Significant components of the Company dry hole expense during 2005
included i $212 million related to Alaskan well costs, ii $95 million associated
with an unsuccessful Nigerian well, iii $35 million attributable to an unsuccessful
suspended well in the Company El Hamra permit in Tunisia, iv $51 million
attributable to an unsuccessful suspended well in the Company Anaguid permit in
Tunisia and v various other exploratory wells. During 2005, the Company completed and
evaluated 180 exploratory/extension wells, 149 of which were successfully completed as
discoveries.
General and administrative expense.
General and administrative expense totaled $1296 million, $1166
million and $1101 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
general and administrative expense during 2007, as compared to 2006, was primarily due
to an increase in performance related compensation costs, including the amortization of
share-based awards to officers, directors and employees. As of December 31, 2007, the
Company has $349 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested
share-based awards that will be charged to earnings over a weighted average period of
approximately one year and five months. The Company continues to monitor its general
and administrative expense and is focused on administrative cost control. If Pioneer
Southwest completes its initial public offering, the Company expects that its general
and administrative expenses would increase.
The increase in general and administrative expense during 2006, as
compared to 2005, was primarily due to a full year effect of the 2005 staff increases
associated with the Evergreen acquisition.
Accretion of discount on asset retirement
obligations. Accretion of discount on asset retirement
obligations from continuing operations was $70 million, $37 million and $33 million
for the years ending during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in
accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations during 2007 was primarily due to
new wells placed on production from the 2007 drilling program and the carryover of the
2006 drilling program. See Note L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding the Company asset retirement obligations.
Interest expense. Interest expense
was $1353 million, $1071 million and $1260 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Company indebtedness for the
year ended December 31, 2007 was 65 percent, as compared to 67 percent and 65
percent for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, including the
effects of interest rate derivatives. The increase in interest expense for 2007 as
compared to 2006 was primarily due to i a $443 million increase in interest incurred
on long-term debt due to a $712 million increase in average debt outstanding, primarily
related to funding additions to oil and gas properties, ii a $54 million increase in
noncash interest expense attributable to certain discounted liabilities and deferred
hedge losses partially offset by iii a $204 million increase in capitalized interest
on the Company Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects in Alaska and South
Africa, respectively. The Company expects interest expense to increase in future
periods due to the completion of the South Africa South Coast Gas project during the
third quarter of 2007 and the Alaskan Oooguruk project facilities nearing completion,
partially offset by declining interest rates on the Company credit facility.
48
The decrease in interest expense for 2006 as compared to 2005 was
primarily due to the repayment of portions of the Company outstanding borrowings
under the Company credit facility with proceeds from the divestiture of the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets and an $111 million increase in interest
capitalized on the Company Oooguruk and South Coast Gas development projects,
partially offset by a $41 million decrease in the amortization of interest rate hedge
gains.
See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information about
the Company long-term debt and interest expense.
Hurricane activity, net. The Company
recorded net hurricane related activity expenses of $613 million, $320 million and
$398 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with the Company
East Cameron platform facility, located on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, that was destroyed
during 2005 by Hurricane Rita.
The Company estimates that it will cost approximately $185 million to
reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon
the East Cameron facilities began in January 2007. The estimate to reclaim and abandon
the East Cameron facility is based upon an analysis prepared by a third party
engineering firm for a majority of the work, an estimate by the Company for the
remaining work that was not covered by the third-party analysis and actual abandonment
activity to date. The incremental $660 million increase in the reclamation and
abandonment obligation during 2007 is primarily due to increasing the estimated time
that it will take to complete certain aspects of the reclamation and abandonment
project based on recent project work experience. During the third quarter of 2007, the
Company commenced legal actions against its insurance carriers regarding certain policy
coverage issues. However, the Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of
the loss will be recoverable by insurance. See Note U of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
for additional information about the Company East Cameron facility reclamation and
abandonment.
Other expenses. Other expenses were
$319 million during 2007, as compared to $369 million during 2006 and $807 million
during 2005. The $51 million decrease in other expense during 2007, as compared to
2006, is primarily attributable to i an $112 million decrease in the Company
postretirement benefit obligations, ii an $81 million decrease in losses on early
extinguishments of debt, iii a $65 million decrease in non-hedge derivative charges
and iv a $40 million decrease in insurance charges, partially offset by v a $127
million increase in charges related to commodity hedge ineffectiveness and vi an $84
million increase in the cost of idle drilling equipment.
The $438 million decrease in other expenses during 2006, as compared to
2005, is primarily attributable to i a $404 million decrease in hedge
ineffectiveness charges and ii an $184 million decrease in loss on early
extinguishment of portions of the Company senior notes, partially offset by iii a
$44 million increase in bad debt expense, iv a $40 million insurance charge, v a
$27 million increase in non-hedge derivative charges and vi $34 million of other
net increases in other expense components.
Income tax provision. The Company
recognized income tax provisions on continuing operations of $1126 million, $1410
million and $1492 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
effective tax rates for 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 32 percent, 48 percent and 45 percent,
respectively, as compared to the combined United States federal and state statutory
rates of approximately 37 percent. The effective tax rates of 2007, 2006 and 2005
differ from the combined United States federal and state statutory rates primarily due
to       
foreign tax rates;
statutes in foreign jurisdictions that differ from those
in the United States, including a newly-enacted South African tax law
allowing for the deduction of 150 percent of development expenditures,
resulting in a $157 million tax benefit in 2007;
an $88 million tax benefit in 2007 related to the
reversal of Tunisian deferred tax asset valuation allowances previously

The Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $1307
million during 2007 as compared to $5895 million during 2006 and $3503 million during
2005. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the results of operations of these assets and the related
gains on disposition are reported as discontinued operations. See Notes V and W of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data included herein for additional data on discontinued
operations.
Capital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity
Capital commitments. The Company
primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas
properties, repayment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations.
Funding for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and
repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of
internally-generated cash flow, proceeds from the disposition of nonstrategic assets or
alternative financing sources as discussed in Capital resources and Financing
activities below. Generally, funding for the Company working capital obligations is
provided by internally-generated cash flows.
Oil and gas properties. The
Company cash expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties during 2007, 2006
and 2005 totaled $21 billion, $14 billion and $11 billion, respectively. The
Company 2007 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by
$7753 million of net cash provided by operating activities, the net proceeds from the
disposition of Canadian assets and borrowings on the Company line of credit. The
Company 2006 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were funded by
$7548 million of net cash provided by operating activities and by a portion of the net
proceeds from the disposition of deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets. The
Company 2005 expenditures for additions to oil and gas properties were internally
funded by $13 billion of net cash provided by operating activities.
The Company strives to maintain its indebtedness at levels which will
provide sufficient financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. The
Company capital budget for 2008 is approximately $10 billion. The Company currently
expects that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund the capital
budget.
Off-balance sheet arrangements. From
time-to-time, the Company enters into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions
that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations of the Company. As of
December 31, 2007, the material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that
the Company has entered into include i undrawn letters of credit, ii operating
lease agreements, iii drilling commitments, iv VPP obligations to physically
deliver volumes and pay related lease operating expenses in the future and v
contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and
determinable, such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in
commodity prices and gas transportation commitments. Other than the off-balance sheet
arrangements described above, the Company has no transactions, arrangements or other
relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely
to materially affect the Company liquidity or
50
availability of or requirements for capital resources. See Contractual
obligations below for more information regarding the Company off-balance sheet
arrangements.
Contractual obligations. The
Company contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, drilling
commitments including commitments to pay day rates for drilling rigs, derivative
obligations, other liabilities, transportation commitments and VPP
obligations.

c
Drilling commitments represent future minimum
expenditure commitments for drilling rig services and well commitments
under contracts to which the Company was a party on December 31,
2007.
d
Derivative obligations represent net liabilities for oil
and gas commodity derivatives that were valued as of December 31, 2007.
These liabilities include $699 million of liabilities that are fixed
in amount and are not subject to continuing market risk. The ultimate
settlement amounts of the remaining portions of the Company
derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to
continuing market risk. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk and Note J of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company
derivative obligations.
e
The Company other liabilities represent current and
noncurrent other liabilities that are comprised of postretirement
benefit obligations, litigation and environmental contingencies, asset
retirement obligations and other obligations for which neither the
ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely
determined in advance. See Notes H, I and L of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company
postretirement benefit obligations, litigation and environmental
contingencies and asset retirement obligations,
respectively.
f
Transportation commitments represent estimated
transportation fees on gas throughput commitments. See Note I of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding
the Company transportation commitments.
g
These amounts represent the amortization of the deferred
revenue associated with the VPPs. The Company ongoing obligation is
to deliver the specified volumes sold under the VPPs free and clear of
all associated production costs and capital expenditures. See Note T of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Capital resources. The Company
primary capital resources are net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from
financing activities and proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets. The Company
expects that these resources will be sufficient to fund its capital commitments for the
foreseeable future. For 2007, the Company capital commitments exceeded estimated cash
flows from operations, resulting in additional borrowings under the Company credit
facility. For 2008, the Company currently expects that cash flow from operations will
be sufficient to fund the Company $10 billion capital budget.
Asset divestitures. In November
2007, the Company sold all of the common stock of its Canadian subsidiaries for net
proceeds of $5257 million. The proceeds from the sale were utilized to reduce amounts
outstanding under the Company credit facility. Associated therewith, the Company
reported a gain of $1013
51
million during the fourth quarter of 2007. The results of operations for
the Canadian assets are included in the Company discontinued operations.
During March 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil
and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $12 billion,
resulting in a gain of $7253 million. During April 2006, the Company sold its
Argentine assets for net proceeds of $6696 million, resulting in a gain of $109
million. The results of operations for these divestitures are included in the Company
discontinued operations. The net cash proceeds from these divestitures were used to
reduce outstanding indebtedness under the Company credit facility, to fund a portion
of additions to oil and gas properties, for stock repurchases and for general corporate
purposes.
During May 2005,
the Company sold all of its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy Black and Lookout
Butte oil and gas properties in Canada for net proceeds of $1972 million, resulting in
a gain of $1383 million. During August 2005, the Company sold all of its interests in
certain oil and gas properties on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net proceeds of $592
million, resulting in a gain of $279 million. During October 2005, the Company sold
all of its shares in a subsidiary that owns the interest in the Olowi block in Gabon
for net proceeds of $479 million, resulting in a gain of $475 million. The net cash
proceeds from the 2005 divestitures were used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness.
During 2005, the Company sold 278 MMBOE of proved reserves, by means of
three VPPs for net proceeds of $8926 million, including the assignment of the
Company obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the VPPs
were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.
See Note T of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information
regarding the Company VPPs.
Operating activities. Net cash
provided by operating activities during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $7753 million, $7548
million and $13 billion, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities in 2007, as compared to that of 2006, was primarily due to increased sales
volumes, increased commodity prices and $749 million of income realized from the
disposal of Alaskan PPT credits, offset by the cash provided by operating activities
associated with the 2006 deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine asset dispositions and
the 2007 disposal of the Canadian assets. The decrease in net cash provided by
operating activities in 2006, as compared to that of 2005, was primarily due to the
loss of cash flow from the aforementioned asset divestitures.
Investing activities. Net cash used
in investing activities during 2007 was $18 billion, as compared to net cash provided
by investing activities of $1455 million and $847 million during 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities during 2007, as
compared to 2006, was primarily due to $16 billion of net proceeds received from the
divestiture of assets during 2006, the substantial portion of which resulted from the
sale of the Company deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine assets, and a $6638
million increase in additions to oil and gas properties during 2007. The increase in
net cash provided by investing activities during 2006, as compared to 2005, was
primarily due to a $3962 million increase in proceeds from disposition of assets,
partially offset by a $2806 million increase in additions to oil and gas properties.
See Results of Operations above and Note N of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
additional information regarding asset divestitures.
Financing activities. Net cash
provided by financing activities for 2007 was $10 billion, as compared to net cash
used in financing activities of $9135 million and $14 billion during 2006 and 2005,
respectively. During 2007, significant components of financing activities included $13
billion of net borrowings under long-term debt and $2214 million of net cash used to
purchase 52 million shares of treasury stock. During 2006, significant components of
financing activities included $5547 million of net cash used to repay long-term
borrowings, $3489 million of net cash used to purchase 89 million shares of stock and
$317 million of dividend payments, partially offset by $174 million of proceeds from
the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock options and employee stock purchases.
During 2005, financing activities were comprised of $3536 million of net principal
repayments on long-term debt, $601 million of payments of other noncurrent
liabilities, primarily comprised of cash settlements of acquired hedge obligations,
$303 million of dividends paid and $9493 million of stock repurchases, partially
offset by $416 million of proceeds from the exercise of long-term incentive plan stock
options and employee stock purchases.
During September 2005, the Company announced that the board of directors
had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1 billion of
the Company common stock. During 2006 and 2005, the Company expended a total of
$3489 million to acquire 89 million shares of stock and $9493 million to acquire
200 million shares of stock, respectively, of which $3453 million and $6407 million,
respectively, were
52
repurchased pursuant to the $1 billion repurchase program. In 2007, the
Board authorized share repurchases of up to $750 million of the Company common stock.
Through December 31, 2007, the Company had repurchased $2128 million of common stock
under this 2007 authorized program.
On January 15, 2008, $38 million principal amount of the Company
650% senior notes matured and were repaid with borrowings under its credit facility.
On August 15, 2007, $321 million principal amount of the Company 825% senior notes
matured and were also repaid with borrowings under the Company credit
facility.
During April 2007, the Company amended its existing Amended and Restated
$15 billion 5-Year Revolving Credit Agreement with an Amended and Restated 5-Year
Revolving Credit Agreement the Credit Facility to extend the maturity and improve
the pricing. The Credit Facility provides for initial aggregate loan commitments of
$15 billion, which may be increased to a maximum aggregate amount of $20 billion if
the lenders increase their loan commitments or if loan commitments of new financial
institutions are added. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding the significant terms of the amended credit facility. During
January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts and designated the
contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with a
portion of the Company Credit Facility indebtedness. The interest rate swap contracts
are variable-for-fixed-rate swaps on $400 million notional amount of debt at a weighted
average fixed annual rate of 287 percent, excluding any applicable margins. The
interest rate swaps have an effective start date during February, 2008, $200 million of
which terminate during February 2010 and $200 million during February 2011.
During March 2007, the Company issued $500 million of 665% senior notes
due 2017 for net proceeds of $4948 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the
665% senior notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit facility.
During May 2006, the Company issued $450 million of 6875% senior notes
due 2018 for net proceeds of $4474 million. The Company used the net proceeds, in
part, from the 6875% senior notes to repurchase $3462 million of its 650% senior
notes due 2008 and for general corporate purposes.
During 2006, holders of all of the $100 million of 4 3/4% senior
convertible notes due 2021 exercised their conversion rights. Associated therewith, the
Company paid $799 million in cash, issued 23 million shares of common stock and
recorded a $220 million increase to stockholders' equity.
During April 2005, $1310 million of the Company 8 7/8% senior notes
due 2005 matured and were repaid. During 2005, the Company also redeemed the remaining
$640 million and $162 million, respectively, of aggregate principal amount of its 9
5/8% senior notes due 2010 and its 750% senior notes due 2012. During September 2005,
the Company accepted tenders to purchase $1884 million in principal amount of the
5875% senior notes due 2012 for $1999 million. The Company utilized unused borrowing
capacity under its credit facility to fund these financing activities.
During 2007, the Company board of directors declared total dividends
of $27 per common share. Associated therewith, the Company paid $160 million of
aggregate dividends during April 2007 and $168 million of aggregate dividends during
October 2007. Future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, and, if declared,
the Board may change the current dividend amount, including in response to the
Company liquidity and capital resources at the time.
In 2007, Pioneer Southwest filed a preliminary registration statement
subject to completion with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If the offering
is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas properties
currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin of West
Texas. Pioneer Southwest registration statement contemplates an offering of 353
percent before underwriters' over-allotment option of its limited partner interests
to the public the Offering. The Offering has been postponed due to market
conditions and timing of the Offering remains uncertain. Completion of the Offering is
subject to market conditions and numerous other risks beyond the control of Pioneer
Southwest, and therefore it is possible that the Offering will not be completed, will
not raise the planned amount of capital even if the Offering is completed, or will not
be completed when planned.
In October 2007, Pioneer Southwest entered into a $300 million unsecured
revolving credit facility PSE Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks. The PSE
Credit Agreement would mature five years following the closing of the Offering and
would contain certain financial covenants that would be applicable to Pioneer
Southwest. As a result of the most restrictive covenant, borrowings under the PSE
Credit Agreement would be
53
expected to be initially limited to approximately $150 million. It is a
condition to the obligations of the lenders under the PSE Credit Agreement that Pioneer
Southwest completes the Offering. Pioneer Southwest is seeking an extension of the
facility from the lenders. There can be no assurance that the lenders will agree to an
extension, or if they do agree, that the terms of the facility will remain unchanged.
If Pioneer Southwest were to seek a replacement facility, there can be no assurance
that it would be able to do so or if it were successful, that the terms would be as
favorable to Pioneer Southwest as the terms under the PSE Credit Agreement. See Notes F
and W of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on the Pioneer Southwest
credit facility and initial public offering.
As the Company pursues its strategy, it may utilize various financing
sources, including fixed and floating rate debt, convertible securities, preferred
stock or common stock. The Company may also issue securities in exchange for oil and
gas properties, stock or other interests in other oil and gas companies or related
assets. Additional securities may be of a class preferred to common stock with respect
to such matters as dividends and liquidation rights and may also have other rights and
preferences as determined by the Board.
Liquidity. The Company principal
source of short-term liquidity is cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under its
credit facility. There were $11 billion of outstanding borrowings under the credit
facility as of December 31, 2007. Including $80 million of undrawn and outstanding
letters of credit under the credit facility, the Company had $307 million of unused
borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2007.
In January 2008, the Company issued $500 million of 2875% senior
convertible notes 2875% Convertible Notes. The notes will be convertible under
certain circumstances using a net share settlement process into a combination of cash
and Pioneer common stock pursuant to a formula. The Company used the net proceeds from
the 2875% Convertible Notes to reduce indebtedness under its credit
facility.
Foreign currency translation. The
functional currency of the Company Canadian subsidiaries was the U.S. dollar USD
and the Canadian subsidiaries' financial statements were maintained in Canadian dollars
CND. In accordance with GAAP, the net assets of the Canadian subsidiaries were
translated into USD-equivalent amounts when they were consolidated into the financial
statements of the Company and resulting translation gains and losses were deferred as
items of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the Company consolidated
stockholders' equity. As a result of modest fluctuations in the USD to CND exchange
rates during 2005 and 2006, the Company recorded other comprehensive income loss in
accumulated other comprehensive income cumulative translation adjustment AOCI
CTA in consolidated stockholders equity of $81 million and $66 million,
respectively. However, during 2007 the CND strengthened significantly against the USD,
associated with which the Company recorded $777 million of other comprehensive income
in AOCI CTA. During November 2007, the sale of the Company common stock in
the Canadian subsidiaries was completed, at which time AOCI CTA was eliminated
as a component of the gain on the divestiture of the Canadian assets. See Note V of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the divestiture of the
Canadian subsidiaries.
Debt ratings. The Company receives
debt credit ratings from Standard Poor Ratings Group, Inc. SP and
Moody Investors Service, Inc. Moodys, which are subject to regular reviews.
SP rating for the Company is BB+ with a stable outlook. Moodys rating for the
Company is Ba1 with a negative outlook. SP and Moodys consider many factors in
determining the Company ratings including: production growth opportunities,
liquidity, debt levels and asset and reserve mix. A reduction in the Company debt
ratings could negatively impact the Company ability to obtain additional financing or
the interest rate, fees and other terms associated with such additional financing. As
of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt
covenants.
Book capitalization and current ratio.
The Company book capitalization at December 31, 2007 was $58 billion,
consisting of debt of $28 billion and stockholders' equity of $30 billion. The
Company debt to book capitalization increased to 48 percent at December 31, 2007 from
33 percent at December 31, 2006, primarily due to increased indebtedness which was used
to fund the Company additions to oil and gas properties and stock repurchases. The
Company debt to book capitalization at December 31, 2005 was 48 percent and decreased
to 33 percent at December 31, 2006. The decrease was principally due to the reduction
of debt from the application of the proceeds received from the divestiture of the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets and Argentine assets in 2006. The Company ratio of
current assets to current liabilities was 77 to 100 at December 31, 2007, as compared
to 60 to 100 at December 31, 2006.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion
in this Report in accordance with GAAP. See Note B of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a
comprehensive discussion of the Company significant accounting policies. GAAP
represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements, the
application of which requires management judgments and estimates including, in certain
circumstances, choices between acceptable GAAP alternatives. Following is a discussion
of the Company most critical accounting estimates, judgments and uncertainties that
are inherent in the Company application of GAAP.
Asset retirement obligations. The
Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities and to
restore the land or seabeds at the end of oil and gas production operations. The
Company removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging
and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms.
Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires
management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are
many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of
what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing,
as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations
considerations.
Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and
judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted
discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory,
environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these
assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligations, a
corresponding adjustment is generally made to the oil and gas property balance. See
Notes B and L of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the
Company asset retirement obligations.
Successful efforts method of accounting.
The Company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil
and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method.
In general, the Company believes that, during periods of active exploration, net assets
and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of
accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method. The
critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full
cost method is as follows: under the successful efforts method, exploratory dry holes
and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during
the periods in which they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting,
such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful
wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion
expense. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized exploration, abandonment,
geological and geophysical expense from i continuing operations of $2793 million,
$2502 million and $1538 million, respectively, and ii discontinued operations of
$144 million, $213 million and $734 million, respectively, under the successful
efforts method.
Proved reserve estimates. Estimates
of the Company proved reserves included in this Report are prepared in accordance
with GAAP and SEC guidelines. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function
of       
the quality and quantity of available data;
the interpretation of that data;
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions;
and
the judgment of the persons preparing the
estimate.
The Company proved reserve information included in this Report as of
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were prepared by the Company engineers and audited
by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company major properties.
Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included
herein.
Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may
substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different
from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results
of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify,
positively or negatively, material revisions to the estimate of proved
reserves.
It should not be assumed that the Standardized Measure included in this
Report as of December 31, 2007 is the current market value of the Company estimated
proved reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company based the
Standardized Measure on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future
prices and
55
costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of
the date of the estimate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information
regarding estimates of proved reserves.
The Company estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion
expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which the Company
records depletion expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may
result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomical to drill for and
produce higher cost fields. In addition, a decline in proved reserve estimates may
impact the outcome of the Company assessment of its proved properties and goodwill
for impairment.
Impairment of proved oil and gas properties.
The Company reviews its proved properties to be held and used whenever
management determines that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying
value of the properties may not be recoverable. Management assesses whether or not an
impairment provision is necessary based upon its outlook of future commodity prices and
net cash flows that may be generated by the properties and if a significant downward
revision has occurred to the estimated proved reserves. Proved oil and gas properties
are reviewed for impairment at the level at which depletion of proved properties is
calculated.
Impairment of unproved oil and gas properties.
At December 31, 2007, the Company carried unproved property costs of
$2775 million. Management periodically assesses unproved oil and gas properties for
impairment, on a project-by-project basis. Management assessment of the results of
exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of
all or a portion of such projects impacts the amount and timing of impairment
provisions, if any.
Suspended wells. The Company
suspends the costs of exploratory wells that discover hydrocarbons pending a final
determination of the commercial potential of the oil and gas discovery. The ultimate
disposition of these well costs is dependent on the results of future drilling activity
and development decisions. If the Company decides not to pursue additional appraisal
activities or development of these fields, the costs of these wells will be charged to
exploration and abandonment expense.
The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas
reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following
conditions are met       
i
The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well.
ii
The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project.
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future
potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination
on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project feasibility is not
contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company
ongoing efforts and expenditures related to accurately predicting the hydrocarbon
recoverability based on well information, gaining access to other companies'
production, transportation or processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to
drill additional appraisal wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued
constantly. Consequently, the Company assessment of suspended exploratory well costs
is continuous until a decision can be made that the well has found proved reserves or
is noncommercial and is impaired. See Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for
additional information regarding the Company suspended exploratory well
costs.
Assessments of functional currencies.
Management determines the functional currencies of the Company
subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in
which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues, costs and
expenses. The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of all of the Company current
international operations. The assessment of functional currencies can have a
significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position.
Deferred tax asset valuation allowances.
The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to
determine whether it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be
realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific, oil and gas
industry and worldwide economic factors and reassesses the likelihood that the
Company net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax attributes in each
jurisdiction will be utilized prior to their expiration. There can be no assurance that
facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the Company to establish
deferred tax asset valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions in a future period. As
of December 31, 2007, the Company does not believe there is sufficient positive
evidence to reverse its valuation allowances related to certain foreign tax
jurisdictions.
56
Goodwill impairment. The Company
reviews its goodwill for impairment at least annually. This requires the Company to
estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units that have
goodwill. There is considerable judgment involved in estimating fair values,
particularly in the estimation of proved reserves as described above. See Note B of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data for additional information.
Litigation and environmental contingencies.
The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for
ongoing litigation and environmental remediation. Actual costs can vary from such
estimates for a variety of reasons. The costs to settle litigation can vary from
estimates based on differing interpretations of laws and opinions and assessments on
the amount of damages. Similarly, environmental remediation liabilities are subject to
change because of changes in laws and regulations, developing information relating to
the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology. Under GAAP,
a liability is recorded for these types of contingencies if the Company determines the
loss to be both probable and reasonably estimable. See Note I of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
for additional information regarding the Company commitments and
contingencies.
Valuations of defined benefit pension and postretirement
plans. The Company is the sponsor of certain defined
benefit pension and postretirement plans. In accordance with GAAP, the Company is
required to estimate the present value of its unfunded pension and accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations. Based on those values, the Company records the
unfunded obligations of those plans and records ongoing service costs and associated
interest expense. The valuation of the Company pension and accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations requires management assumptions and judgments as to benefit cost
inflation factors, mortality rates and discount factors. Changes in these factors may
materially change future benefit costs and pension and accumulated postretirement
benefit obligations. See New Accounting Pronouncements below and Note H of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Consolidated Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company
pension and accumulated postretirement benefit obligations.
Valuation of stock-based compensation.
The Company adopted the modified prospective approach as prescribed
under SFASNo123R on January 1, 2006. Under this approach, the Company is
required to expense all options and other stock-based compensation that vested during
the year of adoption based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. The
calculation of the fair value of stock-based compensation requires the use of estimates
to derive the inputs necessary for using the various valuation methods utilized by the
Company. The Company utilizes a the Black-Scholes option pricing model to measure the
fair value of stock options, b the stock price on the date of grant for the fair
value of restricted stock awards and c the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair
value of performance unit awards.
New Accounting Pronouncements
The following discussions provide information about new accounting
pronouncements that were issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
during 2007       
SFAS 157. In September 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about
fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change
existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of
SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.
SFAS 159. In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The implementation of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
SFAS 141R. In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations SFAS 141. SFAS 141R replaces
SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
business combinations. SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
the fair value as of that date. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares
issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent
consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the
57
accounting for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the
treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in
the acquirer income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes. SFAS 141R is
effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on
or after December 15, 2008, and is to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of
the fiscal year in which the statement is applied. The implementation of SFAS 141R is
not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.
SFAS
160. In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an
amendment of ARB Statement No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 amends Accounting
Research Bulletin ARB No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish
accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an
ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of
equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements,
SFAS160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also
requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts
of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling
interest. SFAS160 is effective for the Company on January1, 2009 and is not
expected to have a significant impact on the Company financial statements.

ITEM
7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK
The following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about
financial instruments to which the Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, and from which the Company may incur future gains or losses from changes in
market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or commodity prices. Although certain
derivative contracts to which the Company has been a party did not qualify as hedges,
the Company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading
purposes.
The fair value of the Company derivative contracts is determined based
on counterparties' estimates and valuation models. The Company did not change its
valuation method during 2007. During 2007, the Company was a party to commodity,
interest rate and foreign exchange rate swap contracts and commodity collar contracts.
See Note J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding the Company
derivative contracts, including deferred gains and losses on terminated derivative
contracts. The following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values
of the Company open derivative contracts during 2007

2007 and 2006, respectively, for which no market risk
exists.
b
At inception, new derivative contracts entered into by
the Company have no intrinsic value.
Quantitative Disclosures
Foreign exchange rate sensitivity.
Prior to its sale, the Company Canadian subsidiary entered into
short-term forward currency agreements to purchase Canadian dollars with U.S. dollar
gas sales proceeds. The Company did not designate these derivatives as hedges due to
their short-term nature.
During November 2007, the Company invested $1317 million Canadian
dollars CND in a CND-denominated escrow account associated with the sale of the
Company Canadian assets see Notes V of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional
information regarding the sale of the Company Canadian assets. During December 2007,
the Company entered into foreign exchange rate derivatives to swap $1317 million CND
for $1310 million U.S. dollars USD to be delivered during May 2008. As of December
31, 2007, the fair value of the foreign exchange rate swap contracts was a liability of
$15 million. The foreign exchange rate swaps were economic hedges of the
CND-denominated escrow account balance; however, uncertainty regarding the matching of
cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the liquidation of the
CND-denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate the foreign exchange
rate swaps as hedges. The CND-denominated escrow account was liquidated during January
2008 for $1290 million USD, at which time the foreign exchange rate swaps were
terminated at a gain of $18 million. Subsequent to these transactions, the Company has
no remaining material foreign exchange rate risk associated with financial
instruments.
Interest rate sensitivity. The
following tables provide information about other financial instruments to which the
Company was a party as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 that were sensitive to changes in
interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present maturities by expected
maturity dates, the weighted average interest rates expected to be paid on the debt
given current contractual terms and market conditions and the debt estimated
fair
59
value. For fixed rate debt, the weighted average interest rate
represents the contractual fixed rates that the Company was obligated to periodically
pay on the debt as of December 31, 2007 and 2006. For variable rate debt, the average
interest rate represents the average rates being paid on the debt projected forward
proportionate to the forward yield curve for LIBOR on February 8, 2008. As of December
31, 2007, the Company was not a party to material derivatives that would subject it to
interest rate sensitivity.

Commodity price sensitivity. The
following tables provide information about the Company oil and gas derivative
financial instruments that were sensitive to changes in oil, NGL and gas prices as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, substantially all of the
Company oil, NGL and gas derivative financial instruments qualified as
hedges.
60
Commodity hedge instruments. The
Company hedges commodity price risk with derivative contracts, such as swap and collar
contracts. Swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes.
Collar contracts provide minimum floor and maximum ceiling prices for the
Company on a notional amount of sales volumes, thereby allowing some price
participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price.
See Notes B, E and J of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a description of
the accounting procedures followed by the Company relative to hedge derivative
financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of the Company
derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in oil, NGL or gas
prices.

Qualitative Disclosures
Non-derivative financial instruments.
The Company is a borrower under fixed rate and variable rate debt
instruments that give rise to interest rate risk. The Company objective in borrowing
under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing
the Company costs of capital. See Note F of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a
discussion of the Company debt instruments.
Derivative financial instruments.
The Company utilizes interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity
price derivative contracts to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity
price risks in accordance with policies and guidelines approved by the Board. In
accordance with those policies and guidelines, the Company executive management
determines the appropriate timing and extent of hedge transactions.
Foreign currency, operations and price risk.
International investments represent, and are expected to continue to
represent, a portion of the Company total assets. Pioneer currently has international
operations in Tunisia and South Africa, which together represented 11 percent of the
Company 2007 oil and gas revenues from continuing operations. Although Pioneer
primary focus is directed toward onshore North American opportunities, Pioneer
continues to identify and selectively evaluate other international opportunities. As a
result of such foreign operations, Pioneer financial results and international
operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange
rates, changes in the legal or regulatory environment, weak economic conditions or
changes in political or economic climates and other factors. For example       
local political and economic developments could restrict
or increase the cost of Pioneer foreign operations;
exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result
in financial losses;
royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims
could increase costs of Pioneer foreign operations;
expropriation of the Company property could result in
loss of revenue, property and equipment;
civil uprising, riots, terrorist attacks and wars could
make it impractical to continue operations, resulting in financial
losses;
compliance with applicable U.S. law could be in conflict
with the Company contractual obligations, the laws of foreign
governments or local customs;
import and export regulations and other foreign laws or
policies could result in loss of revenues;
63
repatriation levelsfor export revenues
could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations               
outside a particular foreign country; and
laws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade,
taxation and investment could restrict Pioneer ability to fund
foreign operations or may make foreign operations more
costly.
Pioneer does not currently maintain political risk insurance. Pioneer
evaluates on a country-by-country basis whether obtaining political risk coverage is
necessary and may add such insurance in the future if the Company believes it is
prudent to do so.
Africa. The Company producing
assets in Africa are in South Africa and Tunisia. The Company views the operating
environment in these African nations as stable and the economic stability as good. The
Company also has an exploration permit in Equatorial Guinea. While the values of the
various African nations' currencies fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the
Company believes that any currency risk associated with Pioneer African operations
would not have a material impact on the Company results of operations given that such
operations are closely tied to oil prices, which are denominated in U.S.
dollars.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer
Natural Resources Company       
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pioneer
Natural Resources Company the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.
As discussed in Note P to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
an interpretation of FASB No. 109, effective January 1, 2007. As discussed in
Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1,
2006. As discussed in Note H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers' Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, effective December 31,
2006.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 19, 2008

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
NOTE A.
Organization and Nature of Operations
Pioneer Natural Resources Company Pioneer or the Company is a
Delaware corporation whose common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Company is a large independent oil and gas exploration and production
company with continuing operations in the United States, South Africa and
Tunisia.
NOTE B.
Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Principles of consolidation. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries since their acquisition or formation.
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 46
revised December 2003 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN46R
requires that the Company consolidated financial statements also include the accounts
of variable interest entities VIEs in which Pioneer holds a variable interest that
will absorb a majority of the entities' expected losses, receive a majority of the
entities' expected residual returns, or both. In accordance therewith, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PNR Holdings LLC as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2007 see Oil and gas properties, below for additional
information regarding PNR Holdings LLC. The Company proportionately consolidates less
than 100 percent-owned affiliate partnerships, for which certain of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries serve as general partners, involved in oil and gas producing activities in
accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-1, Investor
Balance Sheet and Income Statement Display under the Equity Method for Investments in
Certain Partnerships and Other Ventures. The Company owns less than a 31 percent
interest in the oil and gas partnerships that it proportionately consolidates. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries.
The Company owns the majority interests in certain subsidiaries with
operations in the United States and owned the majority interest in a subsidiary with
operations in Nigeria, that was disposed of in 2007. Associated therewith, the Company
has recognized minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries of $119 million and
$144 million in other liabilities and minority interests in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
Minority interests in the net losses of the Company consolidated
Nigerian subsidiary totaled $28 million, $49 million and $52 million for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in interest and
other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Minority
interests in the net income of the Company consolidated United States subsidiaries
totaled $24 million, $26 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in other expense in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Discontinued operations. During
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company sold its interests in the following oil and gas asset

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144,
the Company has reflected the results of operations of the above divestitures as
discontinued operations, rather than as a component of continuing operations. See Note
V for additional information regarding discontinued operations.
Use of estimates in the preparation of financial
statements. Preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of
74
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Depletion of oil and
gas properties and impairment of goodwill and oil and gas properties, in part, is
determined using estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. There are numerous
uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the
projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures.
Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are
subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future
recoverable reserves; commodity price outlooks; foreign laws, restrictions and currency
exchange rates; and export and excise taxes. Actual results could differ from the
estimates and assumptions utilized.
Cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand and depository accounts held by banks.
Investments. Investments in unaffiliated equity
securities that have a readily determinable fair value are classified as trading
securities if management current intent is to hold them for the near term;
otherwise, they are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The Company
reevaluates the classification of investments in unaffiliated equity securities at each
balance sheet date. The carrying value of trading securities and available-for-sale
securities are adjusted to fair value as of each balance sheet date.
Unrealized holding gains are recognized for trading securities in
interest and other income, and unrealized holding losses are recognized in other
expense during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are recognized for
available-for-sale securities as credits or charges to stockholders' equity and other
comprehensive income loss during the periods in which changes in fair value occur.
Realized gains and losses on the divestiture of available-for-sale securities are
determined using the average cost method. The Company had no investments in
available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2007 or 2006.
Investments in unaffiliated equity securities that do not have a readily
determinable fair value are measured at the lower of their original cost or the net
realizable value of the investment. The Company had no significant equity security
investments that did not have a readily determinable fair value as of December 31, 2007
or 2006.
Inventories. Inventories were
comprised of $943 million and $937 million of materials and supplies and $33 million
and $14 million of commodities as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
Company materials and supplies inventory is primarily comprised of oil and gas
drilling or repair items such as tubing, casing, chemicals, operating supplies and
ordinary maintenance materials and parts. The materials and supplies inventory is
primarily acquired for use in future drilling operations or repair operations and is
carried at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out cost basis.
Commodities inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or market, on a first-in,
first-out basis. Any impairments of inventory are reflected in gain loss on
disposition of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Company materials and supplies inventory was net of $11 million
and $42 million, respectively, of valuation reserve allowances.
Oil and gas properties. The Company
utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties.
Under this method, all costs associated with productive wells and nonproductive
development wells are capitalized while nonproductive exploration costs and geological
and geophysical expenditures are expensed. The Company capitalizes interest on
expenditures for significant development projects, generally when the underlying
project is sanctioned, until such projects are ready for their intended use.
The Company generally does not carry the costs of drilling an
exploratory well as an asset in its Consolidated Balance Sheets for more than one year
following the completion of drilling unless the exploratory well finds oil and gas
reserves in an area requiring a major capital expenditure and both of the following
conditions are met       
i
The well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to
justify its completion as a producing well.
ii
The Company is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the
project.
Due to the capital intensive nature and the geographical location of
certain projects, it may take the Company longer than one year to evaluate the future
potential of the exploration well and economics associated with making a determination
on its commercial viability. In these instances, the project feasibility is not
contingent upon price improvements or advances in technology, but rather the Company
ongoing efforts and expenditures related to

accurately predicting the hydrocarbon recoverability based on well
information, gaining access to other companies' production, transportation or
processing facilities and/or getting partner approval to drill additional appraisal
wells. These activities are ongoing and being pursued constantly. Consequently, the
Company assessment of suspended exploratory well costs is continuous until a decision
can be made that the well has found proved reserves or is noncommercial and is charged
to exploration and abandonments expense. See Note D for additional information
regarding the Company suspended exploratory well costs.
The Company owns interests in four natural gas processing plants and ten
treating facilities. The Company operates two of the gas processing plants and all ten
treating facilities. The Company ownership interests in the natural gas processing
plants and treating facilities is primarily to accommodate handling the Company gas
production and thus are considered a component of the capital and operating costs of
the respective fields that they service. To the extent that there is excess capacity at
a plant or treating facility, the Company attempts to process third party gas volumes
for a fee to keep the plant or treating facility at capacity. All revenues and expenses
derived from third party gas volumes processed through the plants and treating
facilities are reported as components of oil and gas production costs. Third party
revenues from continuing operations generated from the plant and treating facilities
for the three years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $400 million, $378
million and $380 million, respectively. Third party expenses from continuing
operations attributable to the plants and treating facilities for the same respective
periods were $121 million, $84 million and $78 million. The capitalized costs of the
plants and treating facilities are included in proved oil and gas properties and are
depleted using the unit-of-production method along with the other capitalized costs of
the field that they service.
Capitalized costs relating to proved properties are depleted using the
unit-of-production method based on proved reserves. Costs of significant nonproducing
properties, wells in the process of being drilled and development projects are excluded
from depletion until such time as the related project is completed and proved reserves
are established or, if unsuccessful, impairment is determined.
Proceeds from the sales of individual properties and the capitalized
costs of individual properties sold or abandoned are credited and charged,
respectively, to accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization. Generally, no
gain or loss is recognized until the entire amortization base is sold. However, gain or
loss is recognized from the sale of less than an entire amortization base if the
disposition is significant enough to materially impact the depletion rate of the
remaining properties in the depletion base.
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the Company reviews its long-lived
assets to be held and used, including proved oil and gas properties accounted for under
the successful efforts method of accounting, whenever events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
indicated if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount
of the assets. In this circumstance, the Company recognizes an impairment loss for the
amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of
the asset.
Unproved oil and gas properties are periodically assessed for impairment
on a project-by-project basis. The impairment assessment is affected by the results of
exploration activities, commodity price outlooks, planned future sales or expiration of
all or a portion of such projects. If the quantity of potential reserves determined by
such evaluations is not sufficient to fully recover the cost invested in each project,
the Company will recognize an impairment loss at that time.
During December 2007, PNR Holdings LLC completed acquisitions of proved
and unproved oil and gas properties located in the United States Raton Basin and
Barnett Shale play for $3522 million for the purpose of conducting oil and gas
producing activities. The Company caused PNR Holdings LLC to be formed pursuant to an
agreement with a third party in anticipation of having the acquisitions treated as part
of a tax-deferred, like-kind-exchange with the anticipated sale of oil and gas
properties to Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Pioneer Southwest, a
subsidiary of the Company. See Note W for additional information on the Pioneer
Southwest initial public offering. The Company controls PNR Holdings LLC pursuant to a
management agreement the Management Agreement whereby Pioneer Natural Resources
USA, Inc. PNR USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, provides operating and
administrative management of all of PNR Holdings LLC properties. PNR Holdings LLC
financed the acquisitions with borrowings under a credit agreement Holdings Credit
Agreement entered into with PNR USA. Under the terms of the Holdings Credit Agreement
and
76
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
Management Agreement, PNR Holdings LLC is a VIE in which PNR USA will
receive substantially all of the entity expected residual returns and absorb
substantially all of the entity expected losses. PNR USA loans under the Holdings
Credit Agreement are secured by the property interests acquired by PNR Holdings LLC.
General creditors of PNR Holdings LLC may lack recourse as a result of PNR USA
secured debtor standing. As of December 31, 2007, PNR Holdings LLC proved oil and gas
properties having a net carrying value of $2603 million and unproved oil and gas
properties with a carrying value of $915 million are included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet of the Company. Outstanding PNR Holdings LLC borrowings of $3518 million
under the Holdings Credit Agreement have been eliminated in consolidation against the
associated loans from PNR USA.
Goodwill. During 2004, the Company
recorded $3278 million of goodwill associated with a business combination. The
goodwill was recorded to the Company United States reporting unit. In accordance with
EITF Abstract Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock Compensation
under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44, the Company has reduced
goodwill by $169 million since September 28, 2004 for tax benefits associated with the
exercise of fully-vested stock options assumed in conjunction with the Evergreen
merger. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but is assessed for impairment whenever events
or circumstances indicate that impairment of the carrying value of goodwill is likely,
but no less often than annually. If the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be
impaired, it is reduced for the impaired value with a corresponding charge to pretax
earnings in the period in which it is determined to be impaired. During the third
quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual assessment of impairment of the
goodwill and determined that there was no impairment.
Other property, plant and equipment, net.
Other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and primarily
consists of items such as heavy equipment and rigs, furniture and fixtures and
leasehold improvements. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful life of the
assets using the straight-line method. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, other property,
plant and equipment was net of accumulated depreciation of $1666 million and $1453
million, respectively.
Asset retirement obligations. The
Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143. SFAS 143 requires that the
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the
period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
Under the provisions of SFAS 143, asset retirement obligations are generally
capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset. Conditional asset
retirement obligations meet the definition of liabilities and are recognized when
incurred if their fair values can be reasonably estimated.
Asset retirement obligation expenditures are classified as cash used in
operating activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.
Derivatives and hedging. The Company
follows the provisions of SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the accounting recognition of all
derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivative
instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through net income.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, the Company may designate a derivative instrument as
hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an
identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk a fair value
hedge or as hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that
are attributable to a particular risk a cash flow hedge. Both at the inception of a
hedge and on an ongoing basis, a fair value hedge must be expected to be highly
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk
during the periods that a hedge is designated. Similarly, a cash flow hedge must be
expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the
hedged risk during the term of the hedge. The expectation of hedge effectiveness must
be supported by matching the essential terms of the hedged asset, liability or
forecasted transaction to the derivative hedge contract or by effectiveness assessments
using statistical measurements. The Company policy is to assess hedge effectiveness
at the end of each calendar quarter.
Under the provisions of SFAS 133, changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the
fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through net income.
Effective changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges
are recognized in

losses, net of tax AOCI - Hedging in the stockholders' equity section of the
Company Consolidated Balance Sheets until such time as the hedged items are
recognized in net income. Ineffective portions of a derivative instrument change in
fair value are immediately recognized in earnings.
See Note J for a description of the specific types of derivative transactions in which
the Company participates.
Environmental. The Company environmental expenditures
are expensed or capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. Expenditures
that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that have no future
economic benefits are expensed. Expenditures that extend the life of the related
property or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized.
Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessment and/or remediation is probable
and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are undiscounted unless the
timing of cash payments for the liability is fixed or reliably determinable.
Treasury stock. Treasury stock
purchases are recorded at cost. Upon reissuance, the cost of treasury shares held is
reduced by the average purchase price per share of the aggregate treasury shares held.
During 2006, the Company retired 229 million treasury shares, resulting in a reduction
in treasury stock of $10 billion.
Revenue recognition. The Company
does not recognize revenues until they are realized or realizable and earned. Revenues
are considered realized or realizable and earned when: i persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, iii
the seller price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is
reasonably assured.
The Company uses the entitlements method of accounting for oil, natural
gas liquid NGL and gas revenues. Sales proceeds in excess of the Company
entitlement are included in other liabilities and the Company share of sales taken by
others is included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets.
The Company had no material oil entitlement assets, NGL entitlement
assets or NGL entitlement liabilities as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. The following
table presents the Company oil entitlement liabilities and gas entitlement assets and

Stock-based compensation. On January
1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS
123R to account for stock-based compensation. Among other items, SFAS 123R
eliminates the use of the Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, intrinsic value method of accounting and
requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the
financial statements. The Company elected to use the modified prospective method for
adoption of SFAS 123R, which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all
unvested stock options and other equity-based compensation beginning in the first
quarter of adoption. For all unvested stock options outstanding as of January 1, 2006,
the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense, based on the fair value
on the date of grant, was recognized in the Company financial statements over their
remaining vesting periods, which ended in August 2006. For equity-based compensation
awards granted or modified subsequent to January 1, 2006, compensation expense, based
on the fair value on the date of grant, is being recognized in the Company financial
statements over the vesting period. The Company utilizes a the Black-Scholes option
pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options, b the stock price on the
date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock awards

and c the Monte Carlo simulation method for the fair value of
performance unit awards. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company followed the
intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 to account for stock options. Prior
period financial statements have not been restated. The modified prospective method
requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to
stock-based compensation as opposed to its prior policy of recognizing forfeitures as
they occurred. The Company recorded no cumulative effect as a result of adopting SFAS
123R.
Additionally, under the provisions of SFAS 123R, deferred compensation
recorded under APB 25 related to equity-based awards should be eliminated against the
appropriate equity accounts. As a result, upon adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company
eliminated $458 million of deferred compensation cost in stockholders' equity and
reduced a like amount of additional paid-in capital in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
$353 million and $321 million of compensation costs for all stock-based plans,
respectively, including compensation costs of $606 thousand and $669 thousand,
respectively, associated with the Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP,
which is a compensatory plan under the provisions of SFAS 123R. The impact to the
Company net income of the year ended December 31, 2006 of adopting SFAS 123R was
$16 million, or less than $02 per diluted share, including the $669 thousand of ESPP
compensation expense recorded in that year.
Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS 123R, the Company issued shares,
as reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders' Equity at December 31, 2007 and 2006, do not include
1,960,475 shares and 1,946,211 shares, respectively, related to unvested restricted
stock awards.
The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and
net income per share as if the Company had applied the fair value recognition

Foreign currency translation. The
U.S. dollar is the functional currency for all of the Company current international
operations. Accordingly, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign
currency are remeasured to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of
each reporting period; revenues and costs and expenses denominated in a foreign
currency are remeasured at the average of the exchange rates that were in effect during
the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were recognized. The resulting
gains or losses from

remeasuring foreign currency denominated balances into U.S. dollars are
recorded in other income or other expense, respectively. Nonmonetary assets and
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are remeasured at the historic exchange
rates that were in effect when the assets or liabilities were acquired or
incurred.
Prior to the sale, the functional currency of the Company Canadian
operations was the Canadian dollar. The financial statements of the Company Canadian
subsidiaries were translated to U.S. dollars as follows: all assets and liabilities
were translated using the exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period;
revenues and costs and expenses were translated using the average of the exchange rates
that were in effect during the period in which the revenues and costs and expenses were
recognized. The resulting gains or losses from translating non-U.S. dollar denominated
balances were recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Stockholders'
Equity for the period through accumulated other comprehensive income loss -
cumulative translation adjustment AOCI-CTA.
During November 2007, the Company completed the divestiture of its
Canadian subsidiaries. As such, the net cumulative translation adjustment previously
deferred in AOCI-CTA was recognized as part of the gain on sale of the Canadian
subsidiaries and, at December 31, 2007, the Company did not translate a Canadian
balance sheet into U.S dollars.
The following table presents the exchange rates used to translate the
financial statements of the Company Canadian subsidiaries in the preparation of the

New accounting pronouncements. The
following discussions provide information about new accounting pronouncements that were
issued by FASB during 2007       
SFAS 157. In September 2006, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about
fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change
existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157
is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The implementation of
SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of
operations of the Company.
SFAS 159. In February 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities SFAS 159. SFAS 159 permits entities to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The implementation of SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material effect on the
financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
SFAS 141R. In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations SFAS 141. SFAS 141R replaces
SFAS 141 and provides greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
business combinations. SFAS 141R requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction
and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at
the fair value as of that date. This includes the measurement of the acquirer shares
issued in consideration for a business combination, the recognition of contingent
consideration, the accounting for pre-acquisition gain and loss contingencies, the
recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for
acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of acquisition related
transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer income tax valuation
allowance and deferred taxes. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008, and is to
be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the statement
is applied. The
80
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

implementation of SFAS 141R is not expected to have a material effect
on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.
SFAS
160. In December 2007, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 160 Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements, an
amendment of ARB Statement No51 SFAS 160. SFAS 160 amends Accounting
Research Bulletin ARB No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish
accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and
for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary, which is sometimes referred to as minority interest, is an
ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of
equity in the consolidated financial statements. Among other requirements,
SFAS160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include
the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. It also
requires disclosure, on the face of the consolidated income statement, of the amounts
of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
interest. SFAS160 is effective for the Company on January1, 2009 and is not
expected to have a significant impact on the Company financial statements.
NOTE C.
Proved Property Acquisitions
During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
expended approximately $3316 million, $783 million and $1734 million, respectively,
to acquire working interests in proved oil and gas properties. During 2007, the
Company proved oil and gas property acquisitions primarily comprised property
interests in the Permian Basin, the Raton Basin, the Barnett Shale play and onshore
Gulf Coast. During 2006, the Company proved oil and gas property acquisitions
primarily comprised property interests in the Permian Basin, onshore Gulf Coast and
Alaska. During 2005, the Company proved oil and gas property acquisitions primarily
comprised property interests in the Permian Basin and onshore Gulf Coast.
NOTE D.
Exploratory Well Costs
The Company capitalizes exploratory well costs until a determination is
made that the well has either found proved reserves or that it is impaired. The
capitalized exploratory well costs are presented in proved properties in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the exploratory well is determined to be impaired, the
well costs are charged to expense.

Lay Creek. The Company Lay Creek project is a coal bed
methane pilot program located in northwestern
Colorado. The Company has drilled 18 wells in six separate pilot areas
and completed workovers and recompletions on 14 wells drilled by a previous operator.
The Company completed the water treatment facilities and initiated sales of production
in 2007. Determination of success of the pilot project is dependent on the ability to
dewater the formation and determine if commercial quantities of gas can be produced.
The pilot project is currently in the dewatering phase and a determination of
commerciality should be known by the end of 2008.

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current
assets, accounts payable, interest payable and
other current liabilities. The carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
Commodity price swap and collar contracts, interest rate swaps and
foreign currency swap contracts.
The fair value of commodity price swap and collar contracts, interest
rate swaps and foreign currency contracts are estimated from quotes provided by the
counterparties to these derivative contracts and represent the estimated amounts that
the Company would expect to receive or pay to settle the derivative contracts. See Note
J for a description of each of these types of derivatives, including whether the
derivative contract qualifies for hedge accounting treatment or is considered a
speculative derivative contract.
Financial assets. The carrying
amounts of the trading securities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of
these instruments. The fair value of the notes receivable approximates the carrying
value at December 31, 2007 due to the adequacy of collateral security and interest
yields. The current portion of the notes receivable, amounting to $36 million and $51
million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in other current
assets, net in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. The trading securities and
the noncurrent portions of the notes receivable are included in other assets, net in
the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Canadian escrow deposit account is a
deposit account denominated in Canadian dollars. The carrying value of this account is
measured in U.S. dollars based on the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate of
9984 as of December 31, 2007. Consequently, the carrying value of the account
approximated its fair value as of December 31, 2007, and is included in other current
assets in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheet.

revolving credit facility PSE Credit Agreement, as amended, with a syndicate of
banks. The PSE Credit Agreement would mature five years following the closing of

contain certain financial covenants that would be applicable to it, including i the
maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10, ii an interest
coverage ratio representing a ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense of not less than
25 to 10 and iii the maintenance of a ratio of the net present value of Pioneer
Southwest oil and gas assets to total debt of at least 175 to 10. Because of the

awards did not change upon adoption of SFAS 123R.

These plans had no assets as of December 31, 2007 or 2006. Other than the Company
retirement plan, the participants of these plans are not current employees of the
Company.
At December 31, 2007, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
pertaining to these plans were determined by independent actuaries for four plans
representing $66 million of unfunded accumulated postretirement benefit obligations
and by the Company for one plan representing $39 million of unfunded accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations. Interest costs at an annual rate of 625 percent of
the periodic undiscounted accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were employed
in the valuations of the benefit obligations. Certain of the aforementioned plans
provide for medical and dental cost subsidies for plan participants. Annual medical
cost escalation trends of ten percent in 2008, declining to five percent in 2013 and
thereafter, and annual dental cost escalation trends of seven percent in 2008,
declining to five percent in 2012 and thereafter, were employed to estimate the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligations associated with the medical and dental
cost subsidies.

accumulated postretirement benefit obligations during the years ended December 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31,
2006. The Company previously recognized the unfunded status of its defined benefit
postretirement plans and currently recognizes periodic changes in its defined benefit
postretirement plans as components of service costs in the period of change as allowed
by SFAS 158. Consequently, the adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on
the Company liquidity, financial position or future results of operations.
NOTE I.
Commitments and Contingencies
Severance agreements. The Company
has entered into severance and change in control agreements with its officers,
subsidiary company officers and certain key employees. The current annual salaries for
the parent company officers, the subsidiary company officers and key employees covered
under such agreements total $420 million.
Indemnifications. The Company has
indemnified its directors and certain of its officers, employees and agents with
respect to claims and damages arising from acts or omissions taken in such capacity, as
well as with respect to certain litigation.
Legal actions. The Company is party
to the legal actions that are described below. The Company is also party to other
proceedings and claims incidental to its business. While many of these matters involve
inherent uncertainty, the Company believes that the amount of the liability, if any,
ultimately incurred with respect to such other proceedings and claims will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position as a whole or
on its liquidity, capital resources or future annual results of operations. The Company
will continue to evaluate its litigation on a quarter-by-quarter basis and will
establish and adjust any litigation reserves as appropriate to reflect its assessment
of the then current status of litigation.
MOSH Holding.
On April 11, 2005, the Company and its principal United States
subsidiary, Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc., were named as defendants in MOSH
Holding, L.P. v Pioneer Natural Resources Company; Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc.;
Woodside Energy USA Inc.; and JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA, JP Morgan as Trustee of
the Mesa Offshore Trust, which is before the Judicial District Court of Harris County,
Texas 334th Judicial District. Subsequently, Dagger-Spine Hedgehog Corporation
Dagger-Spine and a group of approximately fifty other unitholders Wiegand each
filed a Petition in Intervention in the lawsuit to assert the same claims as MOSH
Holding, L.P. MHLP. MHLP, Dagger-Spine and Wiegand collectively, Plaintiffs are
unitholders in the Trust, which was created in 1982 as the sole limited partner in a
partnership that holds an overriding royalty interest in certain oil and gas leases
offshore Louisiana and Texas. The Company owns the managing general partner interest in
the partnership. Plaintiffs allege that the Company, together with Woodside Energy
USA Inc. Woodside, concealed the value of the royalty interest and worked to
terminate the Mesa Offshore Trust MOT prematurely and to capture for itself and
Woodside profits that belong to MOT. Plaintiffs also allege breaches of fiduciary duty,
misapplication of trust property, common law fraud, gross negligence, and breach of the
conveyance agreement for the overriding royalty interest. The relief sought by the
Plaintiffs includes monetary and punitive damages and certain equitable relief,
including an accounting of expenses, a setting aside of certain farmouts, and a
temporary and permanent injunction.
In July 2007, the Company filed a motion for summary judgment
challenging Plaintiffs' standing to prosecute the case and seeking dismissal. The
Company also filed a motion for summary judgment challenging the substantive merits of
Plaintiffs' claims and seeking dismissal. These motions are pending before the
court.
On October 26, 2007, the Plaintiffs and JP Morgan announced before the
Court that they had reached a tentative settlement of claims pending between them. As
part of the tentative settlement, the Plaintiffs and JP Morgan also announced their
intention to seek Court appointment of a temporary trustee. The Company objected to the
terms of the proposed settlement and to the proposed substitution of a temporary
trustee in place of JP Morgan. In addition, on December20, 2007, Pioneer filed a
cross-claim against JP Morgan seeking, among other things, to prevent JP Morgan from
resigning as Trustee on the grounds that the Trust Indenture requires that the Trust
must be liquidated and terminated. On January 22, 2008, the Court issued an order
denying the settlement and proposed trustee substitution, as well as the Company
cross-claim.
The Company believes the claims made by the Plaintiffs in the MOSH
Holding lawsuit are without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. The
Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this proceeding will
91

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

be
adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will materially and
negatively impact the Company liquidity, financial position or future results of
operations.
Equatorial Guinea Block H Arbitration. On
June 14, 2007, a subsidiary of the Company Pioneer EG commenced arbitration in
London, England against Roc Oil Equatorial Guinea Company ROC EG, Atlas Petroleum
International Limited Atlas and Osborne Resources Limited Osborne to determine
the parties' respective rights and obligations under a joint operating agreement
relating to well operations in Block H in deepwater Equatorial Guinea. ROC, Atlas and
Osborne have, in turn, brought counterclaims against Pioneer EG in respect to alleged
breaches of the farm-in agreements relating to Block H. In late 2006, the Republic of
Equatorial Guinea ratified a new hydrocarbons law, which among other things, appears to
entitle Equatorial Guinea to increase substantially its carried interest in all
concessions, including Block H, either directly or through the National Oil Company. In
addition, drilling costs for the well have increased significantly beyond those
originally anticipated.
Given these and other factors, Pioneer EG maintains that it does not
have an obligation to approve the drilling of a well on the block. The view of the
other parties is that Pioneer EG does not have the right to prevent the drilling of the
well or to refuse to pay its share of the costs thereof. ROC EG, Atlas and Osborne have
also notified Pioneer EG that they reserve the right to claim damages should they
suffer any loss, including any loss suffered if the underlying production sharing
contract is terminated by Equatorial Guinea.
The parties have consolidated their respective claims under the joint
operating agreement and the farm-in agreements into a single arbitration to be
conducted in London, England during 2008. Pioneer EG intends vigorously to assert its
position in the arbitration. The Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this
proceeding will be adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will
materially and negatively impact the Company liquidity, financial position or future
results of operations.
Environmental Protection Agency
Investigation.On November 4, 2005, the Company learned from
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that the agency was conducting a criminal
investigation into a 2003 spill that occurred at a Company-operated drilling rig
located on an ice island offshore Harrison Bay, Alaska. The investigation is being
conducted in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney Office for the District of Alaska.
The spill was previously investigated by the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation ADEC and, following completion of a clean up, the ADEC issued a letter
stating its determination that, at that time, the site did not pose a threat to human
health, safety or welfare, or the environment. The Company is fully cooperating with
the government investigation. The Company cannot predict whether the outcome of this
investigation will be adverse to the Company and if so, whether such an outcome will
materially and negatively impact the Company liquidity, financial position or future
results of operations.
Obligations following divestitures.
In April 2006, the Company provided the purchaser of its Argentine
assets certain indemnifications. The Company remains responsible for certain contingent
liabilities related to such indemnifications, subject to defined limitations. The
Company does not believe that these obligations, which primarily pertain to matters of
litigation, environmental contingencies, royalty obligations and income taxes, are
probable of having a material impact on its liquidity, financial position or future
results of operations.
The Company has also retained certain liabilities and indemnified buyers
for certain matters in connection with other divestitures, including the sale in 2007
of its Canadian assets.

Drilling commitments. The Company
periodically enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company is committed
to expend funds to drill wells in the future. The Company also enters into agreements
to secure drilling rig services, which require the Company to make future minimum
payments to the rig operators. The Company records drilling commitments in the periods
in which well capital is expended or rig services are provided.
Transportation agreements. The
Company is party to contractual commitments with pipeline carriers for the future
transportation of gas production from certain of the Company properties located in
the Raton and Uinta Basins. The Raton Basin transportation commitments averaged
approximately 205 million cubic feet MMcf of gross gas volumes per day during 2007,
including fuel commitments, and will average approximately 226 MMcf per day of gross
gas volume during 2008, decreasing to approximately 219 MMcf per day per day during

NOTE J.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses financial derivative contracts to manage exposures to
commodity price, interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company generally
does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. The Company also may enter physical delivery contracts to effectively provide
commodity price hedges. Because these contracts are not expected to be net cash
settled, they are considered to be normal sales contracts and not derivatives.
Therefore, these contracts are not recorded in the financial statements.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair
value. Fair value is generally determined based on the present value difference between
the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date,
and/or the value confirmed by the counterparty. Changes in the fair value of effective
cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
loss, which is later transferred to earnings when the hedged transaction occurs.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as
93
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
hedges, as well as the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value
of hedge derivatives, are recorded in earnings. The ineffective portion is calculated
as the difference between the change in fair value of the derivative and the estimated
change in cash flows from the item hedged.
Fair value hedges. The Company
monitors the debt capital markets and interest rate trends to identify opportunities to
enter into and terminate interest rate swap contracts with the objective of reducing
costs of capital.
As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the Company long-term
debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets included a $32 million reduction
in the carrying value attributable to net deferred hedge losses on terminated fair
value hedges that are being amortized as net increases to interest expense over the
original terms of the terminated agreements. The amortization of net deferred hedge
losses on terminated interest rate swaps increased the Company reported interest
expense by $434 thousand and $14 thousand during the years ended December 31, 2007 and
2006, as compared to net deferred gains amortization, which reduced the Company
reported interest expense by $41 million during the year ended December 31,
2005.
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2007, the scheduled
amortization of net deferred hedge losses on terminated interest rate hedges including
terminated fair value and cash flow hedges that will be recognized as increases to the
Company future interest expense

Cash flow hedges. The Company
utilizes commodity swap and collar contracts to i reduce the effect of price
volatility on the commodities the Company produces and sells, ii support the
Company annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity
price risk associated with certain capital projects. As of December 31, 2007, all of
the Company open commodity hedges are designated as hedges of United States
forecasted sales. The Company also, from time to time, utilizes interest rate contracts
to reduce the effect of interest rate volatility on the Company indebtedness and
forward currency exchange agreements to reduce the effect of exchange rate
volatility.

Interest rate. During March 2007, the
Company entered into treasury lock contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow
hedges of the forecasted interest rate risk associated with the coupon rate on the
Company 665% Notes, which were issued in March 2007. The Company terminated these
contracts for a loss of $15 million, which was recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss net deferred hedge losses, net of tax AOCI
Hedging. The Company did not realize any ineffectiveness in connection with
the treasury lock contracts. See Note F for information regarding the 665%
Notes.
During January 2008, the Company entered into interest rate swap
contracts and designated the contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest
rate risk associated with a portion of the Company credit facility indebtedness. The
interest rate swap contracts are variable-for-fixed-rate swaps on $400 million notional
amount of debt at a weighted average fixed annual rate of 287 percent, excluding any
applicable margins. The interest rate swaps have an effective start date during
February 2008, $200 million of which terminate during February 2010 and $200 million
during February 2011.
Hedge ineffectiveness.
The Company recognized ineffectiveness amounts related to i hedged
volumes that exceeded revised forecasts of production volumes due to delays in the
start up of production in certain fields and ii reduced correlations between the
indexes of the financial hedge derivatives and the indexes of the hedged forecasted
production for certain fields. Ineffectiveness can be associated with closed contracts
i.e. realized or can be associated with open positions i.e. unrealized. The
following table sets forth the hedge ineffectiveness income loss attributable to

prices relative to the commodity prices stipulated in the hedge contracts, partially
offset by the reclassification of net deferred hedge losses to net income as
derivatives matured by their terms. The net deferred losses associated with open cash
flow hedges remain subject to market price fluctuations until the positions are either
settled under the terms of the hedge contracts or terminated prior to settlement. The
net deferred losses on terminated cash flow hedges are fixed.
During the year ending December 31, 2008, based on current estimates of
future commodity prices, the Company expects to reclassify $1572 million of net
deferred losses associated with open commodity hedges and $989 million of net deferred
losses on terminated commodity hedges from AOCI - Hedging to oil and gas revenues. The
Company also expects to reclassify approximately $947 million of net deferred income
tax benefits associated with commodity hedges during the year ending December 31, 2008
from AOCI - Hedging to income tax benefit.
Terminated commodity hedges. At
times, the Company terminates open commodity hedge positions when the underlying
commodity prices reach a point that the Company believes will be the high or low price
of the commodity prior to the scheduled settlement of the open commodity position. This
allows the Company to maximize gains or minimize losses associated with the open hedge
positions. At the time of termination of the hedges, the amounts recorded in AOCI -
Hedging are maintained and amortized to earnings over the periods the production was
scheduled to occur.
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2007, the scheduled
amortization of net deferred losses on terminated commodity hedges that will be
recognized as decreases to the Company future oil and gas revenues

Non-hedge derivatives. During
December 2007, the Company entered into foreign exchange rate swaps of Canadian dollars
CND for U.S. dollars USD. The foreign exchange rate swaps are economic hedges
of a CND-denominated escrow account balance that was funded during November 2007
associated with the sale of Canadian assets see Note V for additional information
regarding the sale of the Company Canadian assets; however, uncertainty regarding
the matching of cash flow timing between the foreign exchange rate swaps and the
liquidation of the CND-denominated escrow account caused the Company not to designate
the foreign exchange rate swaps as hedges. The foreign exchange rate swaps mature
during May 2008 and are for a notional amount of approximately $1310 million USD. The
Company recognized a loss of $15 million associated with these derivatives, which
amount is included in discontinued operations in the Company accompanying
Consolidated Statement of Operations for 2007.

not obtain collateral or otherwise secure the fair value of its derivative instruments,
associated credit risk is mitigated by the Company credit risk policies and
procedures. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no derivative counterparties with
significant credit risks.

Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the
future plugging and abandonment of wells and related facilities. The Company does not
provide for a market risk premium associated with asset retirement obligations because
a reliable estimate cannot be determined. The Company has no assets that are legally
restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. The following table

Asset Divestitures
During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
completed asset divestitures for net proceeds of $5537 million, $16 billion and $12
billion, respectively. Associated therewith, the Company recorded gains losses on
disposition of assets in continuing operations of $22 million, $65 million and
$601 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
and gains of $1002 million, $7318 million and $1665 million in discontinued
operations in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The following represent the
significant divestitures       
Canadian divestiture. In November
2007, the Company completed the sale of its Canadian subsidiaries for net proceeds of
$5257 million, resulting in a gain of $1013 million. The net proceeds from the sale
of the Canadian subsidiaries includes $1328 million of proceeds that were deposited by
the purchaser into the Company Canadian escrow account pending receipt from the
Canada Revenue Agency of appropriate tax certifications, which were received in January
2008. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year
ended December 31, 2007, includes only $3929 million of proceeds from disposition of
assets, net of cash sold pertaining to the sale of the Canadian subsidiaries. As a
result of this divestiture, the Company has reclassified the historic results of
operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of its Canadian assets to discontinued
operations in accordance with SFAS 144.
Nigeria. In June 2007, the Company
entered into an agreement to divest its interest in a subsidiary owned 59 percent by
the Company, the Nigeria Subsidiary that held an interest in the deepwater Nigerian
Block 320. The agreement was subject to governmental approval. The governmental
approval was not obtained by the deadline and as a result, Pioneer terminated the
agreement. Also, as a result of due diligence efforts that emerged as part of the
Company compliance efforts, and with assistance from outside counsel, the Company
determined that it could not, consistent with its legal obligations, fund or approve
future operations in connection with Block 320. As a
100
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
result, during the third quarter of 2007 the Company engaged in a
process to withdraw from the production sharing contract relating to Block 320 and
related agreements. As a part of this process the Company disposed of its shares in the
Nigeria Subsidiary to an unaffiliated third party. As a result, the Company no longer
owns any interest in the Nigeria Subsidiary or Block 320 and will not fund or
participate in any future operations in connection with Block 320. See Note S for
additional information regarding the Nigerian impairment.
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Argentine
divestitures. During 2006, the Company sold its interests
in certain oil and gas properties in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of
$12 billion, resulting in a gain of $7253 million and its Argentine assets for net
proceeds of $6696 million, resulting in a gain of $109 million. Pursuant to SFAS 144,
the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to
discontinued operations. See Note V for additional information.
Volumetric production payments.
During 2005, the Company sold three VPPs for proceeds of $8926 million.
No gain or loss was recognized. See Note T for additional information.
Canadian and Gulf of Mexico Shelf divestitures.
During 2005, the Company sold its interests in the Martin Creek, Conroy
Black and Lookout Butte areas in Canada for net proceeds of $1972 million, resulting
in a gain of $1383 million and certain assets on the Gulf of Mexico shelf for net
proceeds of $592 million, resulting in a gain of $279 million. Pursuant to SFAS 144,
the gain and the results of operations from these assets have been reclassified to
discontinued operations. See Note V for additional information.
East Texas divestiture. During the
year ended December 31, 2005, the Company sold its interests in certain East Texas
properties for $253 million of net cash proceeds with no corresponding gain or loss
recognized.
Gabon divestiture. In 2005, the
Company closed the sale of the shares in a Gabonese subsidiary that owned the Company
interest in the Olowi block for $479 million of net proceeds. A $475 million gain was
recognized with no associated income tax effect either in Gabon or the United States.
During 2007, Pioneer relinquished its rights to receive additional payments for
production discovered from deeper reservoirs on the block in consideration for a
release of certain obligations.

NOTE P.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions
of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. The Company and its
eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated United States federal income tax return.
Certain subsidiaries are not eligible to be included in the consolidated United States
federal income tax return and separate provisions for income taxes have been determined
for these entities or groups of entities. The tax returns and the amount of taxable
income or loss are subject to examination by United States federal, state, local and
foreign taxing authorities. Current and estimated tax payments of $570 million, $1532
million and $414 million were made during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.
SFAS 109 requires that the Company continually assess both positive and
negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax
assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Pioneer monitors Company-specific,
oil and gas industry and worldwide economic factors and assesses the likelihood that
the Company net operating loss carryforwards NOLs and other deferred tax
attributes in the United States, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions will be
utilized prior to their expiration. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company
valuation allowances relating primarily to foreign tax jurisdictions were $248
million and $947 million, respectively.
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. In
conjunction with the implementation of FIN 48, the Company analyzed its filing
positions for open tax years in all of the foreign, federal and state jurisdictions
where it has material tax attributes and is required to file income tax returns. Upon
adoption, the Company believed that its income tax filing positions and deductions
would be substantially sustained on audit and did not anticipate any significant
adjustments. Consequently, the Company adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material
impact on the Company.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction,
and various state and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company believes
that it is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for years before 2002.
In December 2007, the Internal Revenue Service IRS completed an examination of the
Company 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. The Company agreed to proposed IRS
adjustments that resulted in a $06 million deferred tax benefit and a $18 million
reduction of current income taxes receivable. Subsequent amendments of federal and
state returns relating to these audit adjustments are not expected to have a
significant effect on the Company future results of operations or financial
position. In addition, the Company 2003 through 2005 state
income tax returns in Colorado are currently under audit and the Tunisian government is
concluding an audit of the Company 2002 through 2005 income tax returns for the Adam
Concession. No significant adjustments have been proposed in Colorado or
Tunisia.
In February 2007, the Republic of South Africa passed legislation that
included significant new tax benefits for oil and gas activities. Effective January 1,
2007, the Company is allowed a deduction from oil and gas income equal to 200 percent
of exploration expenditures and 150 percent of development expenditures. Pursuant to
the new tax legislation, the Company recorded a $157 million tax benefit for 2007
associated with capital expenditures incurred after the effective date, primarily
related to the South Coast Gas project.
Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 23
Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas, the Company historically treated
the undistributed earnings in South Africa as permanently reinvested and did not
provide for a U.S. tax on such earnings. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company
made the determination that it no longer had identifiable plans to reinvest these
earnings in South Africa and accordingly recorded $189 million of U.S.
deferred tax expense in 2007 associated with the results of operations of its South
African subsidiaries.
During the second quarter of 2007, the Company announced actions to exit Nigeria.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2007, the Company completed its disposal of the
subsidiary holding Block 320 and relinquished
102
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
all its
rights in Block 256. This exit from Nigeria allows the Company to deduct in the U.S.
the cumulative expenditures associated with its past Nigerian activities and
accordingly the Company has recognized a $409 million tax benefit in 2007.
Additionally, the Company has relinquished all remaining rights in Gabon and has
written off costs associated with Block H in Equatorial Guinea generating a $138
million tax benefit in 2007.

NOTE Q.
Income Per Share From Continuing
Operations
Basic income per share from continuing operations is computed by
dividing income from continuing operations by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. The computation of diluted income per share from
continuing operations reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock that are dilutive to income from continuing
operations were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of
common stock that would then share in the earnings of the Company.

value of $4244 million. During 2006, the Company sold certain oil and gas properties
in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and all of its Argentine assets, which had carrying
values of $4306 million and $6587 million, respectively, on their dates of sale.
During 2005, the Company sold certain Canadian and United States oil and gas properties
having carrying values of $589 million and $314 million, respectively, on their dates
of sale. The results of operations of those properties have been reclassified as
discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS 144 and, aside from costs incurred for
oil and gas activities, are excluded from the geographic operating segment information
provided below. See Note V for information regarding the Company discontinued
operations.
The following tables provide the Company geographic operating segment
data required by SFAS No. 131, Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, as well as results of operations of oil and gas producing activities
required by SFAS No. 69, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities as of and

NOTE S.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets to be held and used, including
oil and gas properties, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of those assets may not be recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2005, the Company recognized aggregate impairment charges of $262 million and $644
thousand, respectively.
Nigerian impairment. In June 2007,
the Company entered into an agreement to divest its interest in a subsidiary owned 59
percent by the Company, the Nigeria Subsidiary that held an interest in the
deepwater Nigerian Block 320. The agreement was subject to governmental approval. The
governmental approval was not
109
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
obtained by the deadline and as a result, Pioneer terminated the
agreement. Based on the terms of the agreement, which established the Company
estimate of fair value, the Company recorded a $122 million noncash impairment charge
in the second quarter of 2007 to reduce the net basis to the estimated fair value.
Also, as a result of due diligence efforts that emerged as part of the Company
compliance efforts, and with assistance from outside counsel, the Company determined
that it could not, consistent with its legal obligations, fund or approve future
operations in connection with Block 320. As a result, during the third quarter of 2007
the Company engaged in a process to withdraw from the production sharing contract
relating to Block 320 and related agreements. As a part of this process, the Company
disposed of its shares in the Nigeria Subsidiary to an unaffiliated third party and
associated therewith, the Company recorded a reduction of $20 million to the previous
noncash impairment charge. As a result, the Company no longer owns any interest in the
Nigeria Subsidiary or Block 320 and will not fund or participate in any future
operations in connection with Block 320.
Equatorial Guinea impairment. During
the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a noncash charge of $103 million to
write off the Company remaining basis in Block H in Equatorial Guinea. The charge was
recorded in connection with the ongoing arbitration among the parties participating in
the Block H prospect. See Note I for additional information regarding the Block H
arbitration.
United States impairment. During the
second quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $57 million noncash impairment
provision to reduce the carrying values of certain proved oil and gas properties
located in Louisiana. The impairment provision was determined in accordance with SFAS
144, and reduced the carrying values of the assets to their estimated fair
value.
Gabon impairment. During 2005, the
Company recognized noncash impairment charges of $644 thousand to reduce the carrying
value of its Gabonese Olowi field assets as development of the discovery was
canceled.
Piceance/Uinta Basins. During 2007,
events and circumstances indicated that approximately $1309 million of net assets in
the Company Piceance/Uinta area may have been partially impaired. However, the
Company estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying amounts were
expected to be recovered. Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of
undiscounted cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to write down
those assets to fair value.
NOTE T.
Volumetric Production Payments
During 2005, the Company sold 278 MMBOE of proved reserves by means of
three VPP agreements for net proceeds of $8926 million, including the assignment of
the Company obligations under certain derivative hedge agreements. Proceeds from the
VPPs were initially used to reduce outstanding indebtedness. The first VPP sold 58 Bcf
of gas volumes over an expected five-year term that began in February 2005. The second
VPP sold 108 million barrels MMBbls of oil volumes over an expected seven-year
term that began in January 2006. The third VPP sold 60 Bcf of gas volumes over an
expected 32-month term that began in May 2005 and 62 MMBbls of oil volumes over an
expected five-year term that began in January 2006.
The Company VPPs represent limited-term overriding royalty interests
in oil and gas reserves that: i entitle the purchaser to receive production volumes
over a period of time from specific lease interests; ii are free and clear of all
associated future production costs and capital expenditures; iii are nonrecourse to
the Company i.e., the purchaser only recourse is to the reserves acquired; iv
transfer title to the purchaser; and v allow the Company to retain the remaining
reserves after the VPPs volumetric quantities have been delivered.
Under SFAS No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas
Producing Companies, a VPP is considered a sale of proved reserves. As a result, the
Company i removed the proved reserves associated with the VPPs; ii recognized the
VPP proceeds as deferred revenue which are being amortized on a unit-of-production
basis to oil and gas revenues over the terms of the VPPs; iii retained responsibility
for 100 percent of the production costs and capital costs related to VPP interests; and
iv no longer recognizes production associated with the VPP volumes.

Insurance Claims
Fain Plant. During May 2005, the
Company sustained damages as a result of a fire at its Fain gas plant in the West
Panhandle field. The damages interrupted production from mid-May through mid-July of
2005. The Company maintained business interruption and physical damage insurance
coverage for such circumstances. The Company recognized a total of $179 million in
business interruption recoveries and $44 million in physical damage recoveries
associated with the Fain gas plant fire. The Company recognized $142 million of the
business interruption recoveries in 2005 and the remaining $37 million in 2006, which
is included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations.
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. During
August and September 2005, the Company sustained damages as a result of Hurricanes
Katrina and Rita at various facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Other than the East
Cameron facility discussed further below, the damages to the facilities were covered by
physical damage insurance.
The Company filed a business interruption claim with its insurance
provider related to its Devils Tower field resulting from its inability to sell
production as a result of damages to third-party facilities. During 2006, the Company
settled its business interruption claim with its insurance provider for $185 million,
which is included in income from discontinued operations in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
As a result of Hurricane Rita, the Company East Cameron facility,
located in the Gulf of Mexico shelf, was destroyed. The Company currently estimates
that it will cost approximately $185 million to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron
facility. The operations to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facilities began in
January 2007. The estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron facility is based
upon an analysis prepared by a third party engineering firm for a majority of the work,
an estimate by the Company for the remaining work that was not covered by the
third-party analysis and actual abandonment activity to date. During 2007, 2006 and
2005, the Company recorded additional abandonment obligation charges for changes in
estimates of $660 million, $750 million and $398 million, respectively, which
amounts are included in hurricane activity, net in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Operations.
The $185 million estimate to reclaim and abandon the East Cameron
facilities contains a number of assumptions that could cause the ultimate cost to be
higher or lower as there are many uncertainties when working offshore and underwater
with damaged equipment and wellbores. The Company currently believes costs
could
111
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005
range from $185 million to $205 million; however, at this point no
better estimate than any other amount within the range can be determined, thus the
Company has recorded the estimated provision of $185 million.
The Company filed a claim with its insurance providers regarding the
loss at East Cameron. Under the Company insurance policies, the East Cameron facility
had the following coverages: a $14 million of scheduled property value for the
platform, b $4 million of scheduled business interruption insurance after a
deductible waiting period, c $100 million of well restoration and safety, in total,
for all assets per occurrence and d $400 million for debris removal coverage for all
assets per occurrence.
In December 2005, the Company received the $14 million of scheduled
property value for the East Cameron assets and recognized a gain of $97 million
associated therewith. The Company received the $4 million of business interruption
recoveries in 2006, which is reflected in interest and other income in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company
recorded estimated insurance recoveries of $43 million, which is reflected in other
current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet and in hurricane
activity, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations, related to the
estimated costs for the debris removal portion of the claim as the Company believes
that it is probable that it will be successful in asserting coverage under the debris
removal part of its insurance coverage. During 2007, the Company received $5 million,
reflected in hurricane activity, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, from
one of its insurance providers related to debris removal. At the present, no recoveries
have been reflected related to certain costs associated with plugging and abandonment
and the well restoration and safety coverages, as the Company is working to resolve
coverage issues regarding coverage under this section of the insurance policies. In the
third quarter of 2007, the Company commenced legal actions against its insurance
carriers regarding policy coverage issues, primarily related to debris removal, certain
costs associated with plugging and abandonment, and the well restoration and safety
coverages. However, the Company continues to expect that a substantial portion of the
loss will be recoverable from insurance.

Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Initial Public
Offering unaudited
On January 8, 2008, Pioneer Southwest Energy Partners L.P. Pioneer
Southwest, a subsidiary of the Company, filed an amendment to its registration
statement subject to completion with the SEC to sell limited partner interests. If
the offering is completed, Pioneer Southwest would own interests in certain oil and gas
properties currently owned by the Company in the Spraberry field in the Permian Basin
of West Texas. Pioneer Southwest registration statement contemplates an offering of
7,500,000 common units representing a 353 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer
Southwest. If the offering is completed, the Company would own a 01 percent general
partner interest and a 646 percent limited partner interest in Pioneer Southwest. The
underwriters would be granted a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional
common units. The Company limited partner interest would be reduced to 614 percent
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. In February 2008, the
Company announced that the initial public offering of common units of Pioneer Southwest
has been postponed due to market conditions and timing of the offering remains
uncertain. There can be no assurance that Pioneer Southwest will complete the offering,
or if completed, that the offering will be structured as described above.

Results of Operations
Information about the Company results of operations for oil and gas
producing activities by geographic operating segment is presented in Note R of the
accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Reserve Quantity Information
The estimates of the Company proved reserves as of December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, which were located in the United States, Argentina, Canada, South Africa
and Tunisia, were based on evaluations prepared by the Company engineers and audited
by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the Company major properties and
prepared by the Company engineers with respect to all other properties. Reserves were
estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FASB, which require that reserve estimates be prepared
under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost
escalations except by contractual arrangements. The Company reports all reserves held
under production sharing arrangements and concessions utilizing the economic interest
method, which excludes the host country share of proved reserves. Estimated
quantities for production sharing arrangements reported under the economic interest
method are subject to fluctuations in the commodity prices of and recoverable operating
expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to
recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. The reserve
estimates as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 utilized respective oil prices of
$9545, $6054 and $5962 per Bbl reflecting adjustments for oil quality, respective
NGL prices of $5613, $2982 and $3634 per Bbl, and respective gas prices of $612,
$513 and $636 per Mcf reflecting adjustments for Btu content, gas processing and
shrinkage.
Proved reserve quantity estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties
inherent in the estimation of quantities of proved reserves and in the projection of
future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The accuracy of
such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and
geological interpretation and judgment. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and
production may cause either upward or downward revision of previous estimates. Further,
the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable fluctuate with changes in prices
and operating costs. The Company emphasizes that proved reserve estimates are
inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than
those of currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these estimates are
expected to change as additional information becomes available in the
future.
The following table provides a rollforward of total proved reserves by
geographic area and in total for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as
well as proved developed reserves by geographic area and in total as of the beginning
and end of each respective year. Oil and NGL volumes are expressed in MBbls, gas
volumes are expressed in MMcf and total volumes are expressed in thousands of barrels
of oil equivalent MBOE.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash
Flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed
by applying year-end commodity prices with consideration of price changes only to the
extent provided by contractual arrangements to the estimated future production of
proved reserves less estimated future expenditures based on year-end costs to be
incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, discounted using a rate of
ten percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows. Future
income taxes are calculated by comparing undiscounted future cash flows to the tax
basis of oil and gas properties plus available carryforwards and credits and applying
the current tax rates to the difference. The discounted future cash flow estimates do
not include the effects of the Company commodity hedging contracts. Utilizing
December 31, 2007, commodity prices held constant over each hedge contract term, the
net present value of the Company hedge obligations, less associated estimated income
taxes and discounted at ten percent, was a liability of approximately $1391 million at
December 31, 2007.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not
intended to represent estimates of the fair value of oil and gas properties. Estimates
of fair value should also consider probable reserves, anticipated future commodity
prices, interest rates, changes in development and production costs and risks
associated with future production. Because of these and other considerations, any
estimate of fair value is necessarily subjective and imprecise.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company elected to not pursue the
development of the Clipper project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Associated
therewith, the Company income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of
2007 includes a pretax exploration and abandonment charge of $721 million.
During November 2007, the Company sold its Canadian assets. During March
and April 2006, the Company sold all of its interests in certain oil and gas properties
in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and its Argentine assets, respectively. These
divestitures qualified as discontinued operations pursuant to SFAS 144. In accordance
with SFAS 144, the Company reclassified the results of operations and gains on the
sales of the divested assets from continuing operations to discontinued operations in
the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note V of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these
divestitures that gave rise to the adjustments in the tables above.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
The Company management, with the participation of its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated, as required by Rule
13a-15b under the Exchange Act, the Company disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e as of the end of the period covered by this
Report. Based on that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the Company disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC rules and forms.
Changes in internal control over financial
reporting. There have been no changes in the Company
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the
Exchange Act that occurred during the Company last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company
internal control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the
Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.
As of December 31, 2007, management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective
internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment, management determined that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
based on those criteria.
Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm
that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007. The
report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, is included in this
Item under the heading Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Pioneer
Natural Resources Company       
We have audited Pioneer Natural Resources Company internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Pioneer Natural Resources
Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, Pioneer Natural Resources Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
Pioneer Natural Resources Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, cash flows and
comprehensive income for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007,
and our report dated February 19, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.
