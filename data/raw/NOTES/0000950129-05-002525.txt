The accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements. 55 Table of Contents AMERICAN STATES WATER COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations: American States Water Company AWRis the parent company of
Southern California Water Company SCW, American States Utility Services, Inc. ASUSand its
subsidiary, Fort Bliss Water Services Company FBWS, and Chaparral City Water Company CCWC.
SCW is a public utility engaged principally in the purchase, production, distribution and sale of
water in California serving approximately 250,000 water customers. SCW also distributes electricity
in several California mountain communities serving approximately 22,700 electric customers. The
California Public Utilities Commission CPUC regulates SCWs water and electric business,
including properties, rates, services, facilities and other matters. CCWC is a public utility
regulated by the Arizona Corporation Commission ACC serving approximately 12,600 customers in
the town of Fountain Hills, Arizona and a portion of the City of Scottsdale, Arizona. ASUS performs
water related services and operations on a contract basis. On October1, 2004, ASUSs wholly-owned
subsidiary, FBWS, commenced operation of the water and wastewater systems at Fort bliss located
near El Paso, Texas pursuant to the term of a 50-year contract with the U.S. Government. FBWS
holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
TCEQ. There is no direct regulatory oversight by either the CPUC or the ACC of the operation or
rates of ASUSs contracted services or AWR. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of AWR, SCW, ASUS, FBWS and CCWC. AWRs assets, revenues and operations are primarily
those of SCW. Basis of Presentation: The consolidated financial statements of AWR include the
accounts of AWR and its wholly-owned subsidiaries SCW, ASUS, FBWS and CCWC collectively referred
to as Registrant or the Company and are prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Inter-company transactions and balances have
been eliminated in the AWR consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial
statements required the use of certain estimates by management in determining Registrants assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. None of these
reclassifications had an impact on Registrants Shareholders Equity or Net Income. SCWs Related Party Transactions: SCW and other subsidiaries provide and receive
various services to and from their parent, AWR, and among themselves. In addition, AWR has a $75
million syndicated credit facility. AWR borrows under this facility and provides funds to SCW in
support of its operations. Amounts owed to AWR for borrowings under this facility represent the
majority of SCWs inter-company payables on SCWs balance sheets as of December31, 2004 and 2003.
Interest is charged to SCW in an amount sufficient to cover AWRs interest cost under the credit
facility. SCW also allocates certain corporate office administrative and general costs to its
affiliates using agreed allocation factors. Utility Accounting: Registrants accounting policies conform to accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America, including the accounting principles for
rate-regulated enterprises, which reflect the rate-making policies of the CPUC, ACC, TCEQ and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. The utility subsidiaries, SCW and CCWC, have incurred
various costs and received various credits reflected as regulatory assets and liabilities.
Accounting for such costs and credits as regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation. This Statement sets forth the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for those companies whose rates are established by or are
subject to approval by an independent third-party regulator. Under SFAS No71, rate regulated
entities defer costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it
is probable that those costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period
different from the period in which they would have been reflected in income by an unregulated
company. These deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then reflected in the income
statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in the rates charged for service.
The amounts included as regulatory assets and liabilities that will be collected over a period
exceeding one year are classified as long-term assets and liabilities as of December31, 2004 and
2003. 56 Table of Contents Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Property and Depreciation: SCW and CCWC capitalize, as utility plant, the cost of
additions, betterments and replacements of retirement units. Such cost includes labor, material and
certain indirect charges. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line, remaining-life basis,
based on depreciable plant as of the beginning of each year in accordance with Registrants rate
making process. The aggregate provisions for depreciation for SCW approximated 30% for its water
distribution unit, and approximately 40% for its electric unit for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002.
The aggregate provision for depreciation for CCWC was 25% for each of the same three years.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Replaced or retired property
costs are charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation. Estimated useful lives of Registrants utility plant, as authorized by the CPUC, are as
follows   
Source of water supply
30 years to 50 years
Pumping
25 years to 40 years
Water treatment
20 years to 35 years
Transmission and distribution
25 years to 55 years
Generation
20 years to 25 years
Other plant
7 years to 40 years
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Registrant would recognize an impairment loss only if the
carrying value amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows.
Impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the fair market value of the
long-lived asset. Management judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for recoverability
is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows. As more fully discussed in Note 2, a CPUC
decision issued on July8, 2004 directed SCW to remove certain assets from rate base. An
impairment loss of $482,000 associated with these assets removed from rate base was recorded in
other operating expenses during the year ended December31, 2004. As of December31, 2004, no
other write-downs were required. Goodwill: At December31, 2004 and 2003, Registrant had approximately $119million
and $123million, respectively, of goodwill included in Other Property and Investments. The
goodwill represents the difference between the aggregate purchase price and the fair value of
CCWCs net assets acquired in October2000. Goodwill is reduced on an ongoing basis to reflect the
total tax benefit realized from amortizing, for tax purposes, the excess of tax over book goodwill
basis in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually
and more frequently if circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. The goodwill impairment
model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to
the fair value, using the terminal value method, of the related operations that have goodwill
assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is
performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is
estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step, and is
compared to its carrying value. The amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value represents
the amount of goodwill impairment. Current year analysis indicated no impairment. Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents include short-term cash
investments with an original maturity of three months or less. At times, cash and cash equivalent
balances may be in excess of federally insured limits. The Companys cash and cash equivalents are
held with financial institutions with high credit standings. Accounts Receivable: Accounts receivable is reported on the balance sheet net of any
allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based on Registrants evaluation of the
receivable portfolio under current conditions and review of specific problems and such other
factors that, in our judgment, deserve recognition in estimating losses. Other accounts receivable
consist of amounts due from third parties non-customers for various reasons including mounts due
from contractors and amounts due under settlement agreements. Materials and Supplies: Materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is computed using average cost. 57 Table of Contents Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Interest: Interest is generally not capitalized for financial reporting purposes as
such policy is not followed in Registrants ratemaking process. Interest expense is fully recovered
through the regulatory process as incurred. Revenues: Revenues include amounts billed to customers for services provided and
unbilled revenues representing estimated amounts to be billed for usage from the last meter reading
date to the end of the accounting period. Comprehensive Income: Accumulated other comprehensive income is reported as a
separate component of shareholders equity. Accumulated other comprehensive income OCI includes
an adjustment to the minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No87 Employers
Accounting for Pensions. This item is separately reported on the Consolidated Statement of
Changes in Common Shareholders Equity. The charge to OCI would be restored through shareholders
equity in future periods to the extent the fair market value of the plan assets exceed the
accumulated benefit obligation. For tax purposes, Registrant treats pension and other compensatory
items as flow-through items. As such, the tax effect of the OCI has been reflected as a regulatory
tax liability rather than as a tax benefit in OCI. Earnings Per Share: Earnings per share for all periods presented have been calculated
and presented in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per Common
Share are based upon the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding and net income after
deducting preferred dividend requirements. Diluted earnings per Common Share are based upon the
weighted average number of Common Shares including both outstanding and shares potentially issued
in connection with stock options and stock units granted under Registrants 2000 Stock Incentive
Plan and the 2003 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan, and net income after deducting preferred
dividend requirements. At December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, there were 501,745, 333,679 and 237,610
options outstanding, respectively, under these Plans. At December31, 2004, there were also
approximately 32,400 stock units outstanding pursuant to the 2003 Non-Employee Directors Stock
Plan. Outstanding stock options and stock unit awards, including those issued for dividend
equivalent rights, issued by the Registrant represent the only dilutive effect reflected in diluted
weighted average shares outstanding. The difference between basic and diluted EPS is the effect of
stock options and stock units that, under the treasury share method, give rise to common stock
equivalents. The following table summarizes the calculation of basic EPS and diluted EPS

Debt Issuance Costs and Redemption Premiums: Original debt issuance costs are
capitalized and amortized over the lives of the respective issues. Premiums paid on the early
redemption of debt, which is reacquired through refunding, are deferred and amortized over the life
of the debt issued to finance the refunding. Other Credits and Liabilities: For SCW, advances for construction represent amounts
advanced by developers, which are generally refundable at rates ranging from 10% to 22% of the
revenue received from the installations for which funds were advanced or in equal annual
installments over periods of time ranging from 10 to 40-year periods. Contributions-in-aid of
construction are similar to advances, but require no refunding and are amortized over the useful
lives of the related property. For CCWC, advances for construction represent amounts advanced by
developers which are refundable over 10 to 20years. Refund amounts under the contracts are based
on annual revenues from the extensions. 58 Table of Contents Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued In October2003, Registrant entered into a finance agreement with a third-party to finance its
annual insurance premiums for the 2003-2004 policy year. Total amount financed was approximately
$20million and was payable in nine equal monthly installments beginning on November1, 2003,
bearing an annual interest rate of 24%. As of December31, 2003, approximately $13million
remained outstanding under this agreement and had been included in Other current liabilities on
the balance sheets. During 2004, Registrant did not enter into a similar arrangement. Derivative Instrument: Registrant has certain block-forward purchase power contracts
that are subject to SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,
as amended by SFAS Nos. 138 and 149. A derivative financial instrument or other contract derives
its value from another investment or designated benchmark. SFAS No133 requires companies to
record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities, and to measure those instruments
at their fair value. Certain of these contracts qualify as an exception provided under the
Statement for activities that are considered normal purchases and normal sales. These contracts are
reflected in the statements of income at the time of contract settlement. SCW became a party to block-forward purchase power contracts that qualify as derivative
instruments under SFAS No133. Contracts with Pinnacle West Capital Corporation PWCCwhich
became effective in November2002 have not been designated as normal purchases and normal sales
and, as a result, have been recognized at fair market value on the balance sheets as of December
31, 2004 and 2003, and included in other current liabilities. This resulted in a pretax unrealized
loss gainof $136,000, $638,000 and $25million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. On a
monthly basis, the related asset or liability is adjusted to reflect the fair market value at the
end of each month. As this contract is settled, the realized gains or losses are recorded in power
purchased for resale, and the unrealized gains or losses are reversed. The market prices used to
determine the fair value for this derivative instrument were estimated based on independent sources
such as broker quotes and publications. Settlement of this contract occurs on a cash or net basis
through 2006 and by physical delivery through 2008. In addition, the financing element of the PWCC contract has been included in cash flows from
financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with SFAS No149, Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. For the years ended December31,
2004 and 2003, Registrant has reflected in its Statement of Cash Flows approximately $20million
and $18million, respectively, related to the financing portion of the purchased power contracts
with PWCC. Under the terms of its power purchase contracts with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Mirant Marketing and PWCC, SCW is required to post security, at the request of the seller, if
SCW is in default under the terms of the contract and the future value of the contract is greater
than the future value of contracts of a similar term on the date of default. SCW will be in default
under the terms of these contracts if its debt is rated less than BBB- by Standard Poors Ratings
Service SP or Fitch, Inc. Fitch or less than Baa3 by Moodys Investor Services, Inc
Moodys. SCW currently has a rating of A- by SP and A2 by Moodys. Fitch does not rate SCW. Except as discussed above, Registrant has no other derivative financial instruments, financial
instruments with off-balance sheet risk or financial instruments with concentrations of credit
risk. Fair Value of Financial Instruments: For cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt, the carrying amount is assumed to approximate
fair value due to the short-term nature of the amounts. The table below estimates the fair value of
long-term debt held by Registrant. Rates available to Registrant at December31, 2004 and 2003 for
debt with similar terms and remaining maturities were used to estimate fair value for long-term
debt. Changes in the assumptions will produce differing results.

59 Table of Contents Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued Stock Options: Registrant has a Stock Incentive Plan and a Non-Employee Directors
Stock Plan, which is described more fully in Note 10. Registrant applies Accounting Principles
Board Opinion APBNo25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, in accounting for its stock
options which uses the intrinsic value method. Accordingly, no compensation expense for the Plans
has been recognized for options granted at fair value at the date of grant. Registrant has also
adopted the disclosure-only requirements of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. If Registrant had elected to adopt the optional recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123 for its stock options, net income and earnings per share applicable to common shareholders

New Accounting Pronouncements In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation
FIN No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities VIE, revised in December2003 by
FIN No46R, which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a
controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly
should consolidate the entity. FIN No46R, which was issued in December2003, replaces FIN No46.
FIN 46 and FIN 46-R were effective by March15, 2004. The adoption of FIN No46R did not have any
impact on the Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows as the
Registrant does not have any variable interests in VIEs at this time. In December2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 SAB 104, Revenue
Recognition. SAB 104 supercedes SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104
rescinds accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements,
which was superseded as a result of the issuance of Emerging Issues Task Force EITFIssue No.
00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed
to reflect the issuance of EITF 00-21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely
unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have any impact on
Registrants financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In March 2004, the EITF issued a consensus on EITF Issue No03-06, Participating Securities and
the Two-ClassMethod under FASB Statement 128. EITF 03-06 addresses the computations of
earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually
entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company. Further guidance on the
application and allocations of the two-class method of calculating earnings per share is also included. The
provisions of EITF 03-06 were effective for reporting periods beginning after March 31, 2004. The
adoption of this guidance has not had a significant impact on Registrants financial results of operations
and financial position. 60 Table of Contents Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued In May2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.
FSP FAS 106-2 provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Modernization Act, to employers that sponsor
postretirement health care plans which provide prescription drug benefits and supersedes FSP FAS
106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. Registrants postretirement medical plan does not
provide prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible employees and is not affected by the
Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. In October2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law and
provides a new federal income tax deduction from qualified U.S. production activities, which will
be phased in from 2005 through 2010. Accordingly, Registrant is currently evaluating the effect,
if any, the Act will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note
8 for further information. In November2004, the EITF issued a consensus on EITF Issue No03-13, Applying the Conditions
in Paragraph42 of FASB No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,
in Determining Whether to Report Discontinued Operations. EITF 03-13 clarifies the approach for
assessing whether the conditions in paragraph 42 of SFAS No144 for reporting results of a
disposed component as discontinued operations have been met. EITF 03-13 should be applied to a
component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held for sale in fiscal
periods beginning after December15, 2004. Previously reported operating results related to
transactions initiated within an enterprises fiscal year that includes the date that this
consensus is ratified may be reclassified to reflect the consensus. EITF 03-13 did not, and is not
expected to, have a material impact on Registrants financial statements. In December2004, the FASB issued a revision to SFAS 123, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R
which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123. SFAS 123R
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the income statement based on fair values. Pro forma disclosure of fair value
information is no longer an alternative. The Statement is effective in the first interim or annual
period beginning after June15, 2005. Adoption is to be made using either the modified prospective
method or the modified retrospective method. The modified prospective method recognizes cost based
on the requirements for all share-based payments granted after the effective date and for awards
granted prior to the effective date that remain unvested prior to the effective date. The modified
retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method but also permits
restatement of financial statements based on pro forma amounts previously recognized under SFAS
123. Restatement can either be for all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year
of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Registrant continues to evaluate the impacts and timing
of adopting SFAS 123R. Registrant currently discloses the pro forma impacts of recognizing fair
value as permitted by SFAS 123 in Note 1. That disclosure reflects
Registrants estimate of 2004
expense for share-based payments of approximately $934,000 after-tax. 61 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters In accordance with accounting principles for rate-regulated enterprises, Registrant records
regulatory assets, which represent probable future revenue associated with certain costs that will
be recovered from customers through the rate-making process, and regulatory liabilities, which
represent probable future reductions in revenue associated with amounts that are to be credited to
customers through the rate-making process. At December31, 2004, Registrant had $262million of
regulatory assets not accruing carrying costs. Of this amount, $153million relates to the
regulatory asset for costs deferred on the Aerojet matter disclosed below as a non-yielding
regulatory asset. In addition, other regulatory assets not accruing carrying costs include a
deferred income tax balance of $77million representing accelerated tax benefits previously
flowed-through to ratepayers, which will be included in rates concurrently with recognition of the
associated tax expense. Finally, there are other expenses that Registrant recovers in rates over a
short period that do not provide for recovery of carrying costs. At December31, 2004, $32million
was recorded as other regulatory assets for such costs to be recovered. Regulatory assets, less regulatory liabilities, included in the consolidated balance sheets
are as follows

Supply Cost Balancing and Memorandum Accounts As permitted by the CPUC, SCW maintains electric supply balancing accounts and, prior to
November29, 2001, maintained water supply balancing accounts to account for under-collections and
over-collections of revenues designed to recover such costs. Costs are recorded as expenses and
charged to balancing accounts when such costs are incurred. The balancing accounts are reversed
when such costs are recovered through rate adjustments or through refunds of previously incurred
costs. SCW accrues interest on its supply cost balancing accounts at the prevailing rate for 90-day
commercial paper. CCWC does not maintain a supply cost balancing account. Water Memorandum Supply Cost Account On November29, 2001, the CPUC ordered water utilities
with existing water supply balancing accounts to cease booking amounts to such accounts. In its
place, water utilities are now required to establish a memorandum supply cost account. The over- or
under-collection of water supply costs is recorded in this memorandum account in a manner similar
to the balancing account. In a decision issued on June19, 2003 related to the memorandum supply
cost account, the CPUC concluded that: iif a utility is within its 3-year rate case cycle and
does not earn in excess of its authorized rate of return, the utility is entitled to recover its
costs in the memorandum supply cost account, subject to a reasonableness review by the CPUC; ii
if a utility is either within or outside of its rate case cycle and earns in excess of its
authorized rate-of-return, the utilitys recovery of expenses from the memorandum supply cost
account will be reduced by the amount exceeding the authorized rate-of-return, and iiia utility
is required to seek review of under and over collections by filing an advice letter annually. 62 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued On April30, 2004, SCW filed advice letters for Regions I and II for the period from November
29, 2001 to December31, 2003 with respect to an approximate $14million net over-collection,
which has been recorded as a regulatory liability. An additional $450,000 of net over-collection
related to the year ended December31, 2004 has also been recorded as a regulatory liability at
December31, 2004. SCW recently filed an advice letter with the CPUC for review of the activity in
the Region III memorandum supply cost account for the period from November29, 2001 to December31,
2003. Region III had an under-collected balance of $66million and $52million at December31,
2004 and December31, 2003, respectively, which are subject to earnings tests. A regulatory asset
with respect to this under-collection will not be recorded until receipt of a CPUC decision
authorizing the recovery of the under-collection. Electric Balancing Account Electric power costs incurred by SCWs Bear Valley Electric
division continue to be charged to its electric supply cost balancing account. The under-collection
in the electric balancing account is $229million at December31, 2004 which was mostly incurred
during the energy crisis in late 2000 and early 2001. The CPUC has authorized SCW to collect a
surcharge from its customers of 22 per kilowatt hour through August2011, to enable SCW to
recover the under-collection. SCW sold 137,857,398, 132,849,639 and 131,826,314 kilowatt hours of
electricity to its Bear Valley Electric division customers for the years ended December31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. SCW anticipates electricity sales to be sufficient for it to recover
the amount of the under-collection by August2011. SCW is allowed to include only up to a weighted
annual energy purchase cost of $77 per MWh each year through August2011 in its electric supply
cost balancing account. To the extent that the actual weighted average annual cost for power
purchased exceeds the $77 per MWh amount, SCW will not be able to include these amounts in its
balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. During the years ended December2004, 2003 and
2002, SCW expensed approximately $195,000, $240,000 and $718,000, respectively, for costs over $77
per MWh. During April2001, SCW recorded a one-time sale of energy on the spot market that generated a
$644,000 gain which was recorded in the electric supply cost balancing account at that time. The
gain was the subject of a complaint filed at the FERC by Mirant Marketing, the purchaser of the
energy, was seeking to be refunded all or a portion of the gain. In March2004, the FERC ordered
SCW to refund the $644,000, plus interest, to Mirant Marketing. This refund increased the cost of
power purchased for resale during the year ended December31, 2004, with a corresponding decrease
in the provision for supply cost balancing account. There was no net impact on earnings. On November1, 2004, the FERC issued another order, granting a request for clarification filed
by the Western Systems Power Pool WSPP and supported by SCW in the complaint proceeding filed
by Mirant Marketing in connection with the April2001 sale. The order agrees with WSPP and SCW that
the WSPP agreement allowed SCW to collect the WSPP agreements cost-based adder in addition to the
SCWs incremental cost of selling to Mirant Marketing. In the FERCs original order, SCW was denied
its request to charge the cost based adder. In the November1, 2004 order, the FERC reversed this
denial and stated that it denied SCWs application of the adder to the Mirant Marketing sale
premised solely on the view that the adder applied only in the case of owned resources. The result
of this new order is to allow SCW to charge a $2111 per MWh adder on top of the $9500 per MWh.
The amount of this adder results in a reduction in the amount refunded to Mirant Marketing in March
2004 by approximately $253,000 inclusive of interest. SCW will apply any payments received by
Mirant Marketing as a reduction to SCWs unrecovered purchased power costs in its electric supply
cost balancing account, with a corresponding decrease in the cost of power purchased for resale,
thus resulting in no net impact on earnings. Costs Deferred for Future Recovery SCW sued Aerojet-General Corporation Aerojet for causing the contamination of the
Sacramento County Groundwater Basin, which affected certain SCW wells. On a related matter, SCW
also filed a lawsuit against the State of California the State. The CPUC authorized memorandum
accounts to allow for recovery, from customers, of costs incurred by SCW in prosecuting the cases
against Aerojet and the State, less any recovery from the defendants or others. On October30,
2003, SCW in its Region I abbreviated case filed a balance of approximately $22million in its
memorandum account which consisted primarily of deferred litigation costs and carrying costs. The
filing requested a 20-year amortization with the CPUC. 63 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued As of December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, approximately $153million and $162million,
respectively, had been recorded as a non-yielding regulatory asset representing primarily the legal
costs incurred to date in connection with prosecuting the cases. The difference between the amount
filed with the CPUC for recovery in rates and those recorded primarily relate to the carrying costs
which will not be recorded as a regulatory asset until receipt of a CPUC decision authorizing the
recovery of the entire memorandum account filed. Management believes the recovery of these costs
through rates is probable; however, it is managements intention to offset any settlement proceeds
from Aerojet that may occur from these actions against the balance in the memorandum account at the
time of settlement. SCW filed for interim rate relief during the fourth quarter of 2004. This
interim rate relief would have provided for an increase in rates of approximately $6million over a
10year period, subject to refund. In January2005, a joint ruling of the assigned Commissioner and
Administrative Law Judge denied SCWs request for an interim amortization. The motion was denied
primarily because the hearing on the merits was only weeks away March14-15, 2005 and an expected
proposed decision, and CPUC action on it, may be soon thereafter. Management remains of the opinion
that the recovery of these costs through rates is probable; however, management cannot give
assurance that the CPUC will ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs that have
accumulated in this memorandum account. See Note 12 for further discussion on the Aerojet matter. Transmission Line Abandonment Costs The ability of SCW to deliver purchased power to customers in its Bear Valley Electric service
area is limited by the ability of the transmission facilities owned by Southern California Edison
Company Edison to transmit this power. SCW filed a lawsuit against Edison in 2000 for breach of
contract as a result of delays in upgrading these transmission facilities as well as for other
reasons. In March2004, SCW and Edison agreed to settle this suit. Under the terms of the
settlement agreement, SCW is to pay a $5million project abandonment fee to Edison. Edison filed an
application to the FERC for approval to treat the entire $5million settlement payment as an
abandoned project cost to be included in Edisons wholesale rate charged to SCW. Management
believed that the FERCs approval of Edisons filing was probable and the abandonment costs
included in Edisons wholesale rate to SCW were recoverable through rates. As a result, the $5
million obligation to Edison arising from the settlement was recorded as a regulatory asset during
the fourth quarter of 2003. SCW made an initial lump sum payment of $14million to Edison during the first quarter of
2004 and agreed to pay Edison the remaining $36million over a 15year term through 180 equal
monthly payments of $38,137. In August2004, the FERC approved Edisons application and SCW
recorded the $14million payment in the electric supply cost balancing account. This amount was
previously recorded as a regulatory asset pending FERC approval of Edisons application. In
addition, monthly payments totaling $228,822 made to Edison during the year ended December31, 2004
are also included in the electric supply cost balancing account. Asset Retirement Obligations As more fully discussed in Note 3, effective January1, 2003, Registrant adopted SFAS No143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Because retirement costs have historically been
recovered through rates at the time of retirement, at implementation of SFAS No143, the
cumulative effect has been reflected as a regulatory asset. Registrant will also reflect the gain
or loss at settlement as a regulatory asset or liability on the balance sheet. Low Income Balancing Accounts This regulatory asset reflects primarily the costs of implementing the California Alternate
Rates for Water CARW program in SCWs Region II and Region III to date and the California
Alternate Rate for Energy CARE program in SCWs electric division. These programs mandated by
the CPUC provide a 15% discount for qualified low-income individuals. The low income balancing
account was established in May2002 to track all the discounts and costs related to this program
for future recovery in rates. The Company anticipates the discounts for low income families will
eventually be incorporated in SCWs base rates to customers. SCW accrues interest on its low
income balancing accounts at the prevailing rate for 90-day commercial paper. 64 Table of Contents Note 2 Regulatory Matters Continued General Rate Case Memorandum Accounts Due to delays in the CPUCs review and processing of the Region I and II General Rate Case
applications, SCW was authorized to collect interim rates in early 2004, subject to refund. In
decisions issued in August2004, the CPUC authorized new rates effective retroactively to January
1, 2004 for Region I and February14, 2004 for Region II. SCW was authorized to file an advice
letter, which has been approved by the CPUC, to recover over a period of not less than one year,
the difference between the interim rates authorized in January2004 and February2004,
respectively, and the new rates authorized in the August2004 decisions. As a result of these
decisions, SCW recorded approximately $22million as a non-yielding regulatory asset with a
corresponding increase to revenues during the third quarter of 2004. In January2005, the CPUC
approved the advice letter filing. The decision also changes the revenue requirement related to the
adopted rates for the supply cost memorandum account and depreciation expense that were also
retroactive to February14, 2004 for Region II. The net impact of these changes did not have a
material effect on Registrants earnings. Refund of Water Right Lease Revenues In 1994, SCW entered into a contract to lease to the City of Folsom, 5,000 acre-feet per year
of water rights from the American River. SCW included all associated revenues in a non-operating
income account. In a decision issued on March16, 2004, the CPUC determined that SCW failed to seek
the CPUCs approval to effectuate the lease and was to pay a fine of $180,000. The decision also
ordered SCW to refund 70percent of the total amount of lease revenues received since 1994, plus
interest, to customers. Pursuant to the order, SCW recorded a $62million regulatory liability
with a corresponding charge against non-operating income net of taxes of $25million during the
fourth quarter of 2003. Management disagreed with the CPUCs decision and filed an appeal to the
decision. The CPUC denied the Companys request for an appeal. The Company filed with the Supreme
Court of California to hear the matter, which was also denied in February of 2005. As the final
amount of the refund was approved by the CPUC in June of 2004, SCW adjusted its estimate of total
customer refunds, recorded as a regulatory liability, to the approved amount of $52million.
Pursuant to the order, the apportionment of any lease revenues that SCW may collect in the future
will be determined by a later decision. Therefore, beginning in the first quarter of 2004, all
amounts billed to the City of Folsom are included in a regulatory liability account and no amounts
have been recognized as revenue for 2004 until all uncertainties about this matter are resolved
with the CPUC. For the year ended December31, 2004, SCW recorded an additional $11million in the
regulatory liability account. Revenues Subject to Refund In March2002, SCW and the City of Santa Monica City reached a settlement agreement in
which SCW sold its water rights in the Charnock Groundwater Basin Basin to the City and
assigned to the City its rights against all potentially responsible parties PRPs who stored,
transported and dispensed gasoline containing methyl tertiary butyl ether MTBE in underground
storage tanks, pipelines or other related infrastructure in the Basin. The City also indemnified
SCW from related claims. On July8, 2004, the CPUC approved the settlement agreement and directed SCW to: itrack the
net settlement proceeds in an interest-bearing memorandum account to fund capital for
infrastructure improvements over the next eight years, iimaintain records of all memorandum
account activity, iiiobtain the CPUCs approval to include those capital costs in rate base as
the improvements become necessary and useful, ivremove relevant assets from rate base, and v
refund to ratepayers the net proceeds of $35million received from PRPs, which was recorded as a
liability in December2003 on the basis of a Proposed Decision by the CPUC. In May2004, SCW
received the full settlement payment of $57million from the City. The total proceeds of $57
million from the sale and the assignment of rights were offset by an impairment loss of $482,000
associated with assets removed from rate base, pursuant to the decision, resulting in a $52
million net pretax increase in operating income. SCW recorded the impairment loss on assets removed
from rate-base in other operating expenses. 65 Table of Contents Note 3 Utility Plant The following table shows Registrants utility plant by major class in thousands

Military Privatization ASUS is an active participant in bidding on contracts for the privatization of military bases.
In June2004, ASUS received notification that it had been awarded a 50-year service contract to
own, operate and maintain the water and wastewater systems at Fort Bliss, located near El Paso,
Texas, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, FBWS. On October1, 2004, FBWS commenced operation of the
water and wastewater systems at Fort Bliss pursuant to the terms of the 50-year contract with the
U.S. Government. Title of the water and wastewater assets passed to FBWS effective October1, 2004
with a purchase price of approximately $95million for the water and wastewater systems. Under the economics of the arrangement with the U.S. Government, FBWS should recover 100% of
its investment in the assets under the 50-year service contract. A capital investment recovery
charge in an amount equal to the payments due under the purchase obligation is paid to FBWS by the
U.S. Government as a result of the purchase of the systems. Accordingly, Registrant recorded the
purchase price obligation of $95million as a liability offset with a receivable
of the same amount, therefore, not impacting Registrants financial position. In
addition, as of December31, 2004 approximately $11million of interest had accrued on the
obligation offset by interest income in the same amount. The amounts charged by FBWS for water
and wastewater services at U.S. Army Fort Bliss will be based upon the terms of the 50-year
contract between FBWS and the U.S. Government, rather than rates set by the TCEQ. Under the terms
of this agreement, FBWS has agreed to own, operate and maintain the water and wastewater systems at
Fort Bliss for a net fixed price of $181,206 for operation and maintenance, and $147,146 for
renewals and replacements per month for a period of two years. Prices will be re-determined at the
end of the two year period and every three years thereafter. In addition, prices may be equitably
adjusted for changes in law and other circumstances. The fixed price for operation and maintenance
is recorded in revenues on a monthly basis as the services are performed. The amount received for
renewals and replacements are initially recorded as advances included in other liabilities until
capital projects are completed. As of and for the year ended December31, 2004, FBWS has recorded
$544,000 in revenues and $441,000 of advances. The contract may be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for
convenience of the U.S. Government or as a result of default or nonperformance by FBWS. In either
event, ASUS should be entitled to recover the remaining amount of its capital investment pursuant
to the terms of a termination settlement which would be executed by ASUS and the U.S. Government at
the time of termination. 66 Table of Contents Note 3 Utility Plant Continued Asset Retirement Obligation Effective January1, 2003, Registrant adopted SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, which requires businesses to record the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred. When the liability is initially
recorded, the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived
asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized
cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, an
entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon
settlement. Registrants legal obligations for retirement reflect principally the retirement of
wells, which by law need to be destroyed and filled at the time of removal. As such, the regulated
subsidiaries of AWR incur asset retirement obligations. Retirement costs have historically been
recovered through rates at the time of retirement. Accordingly, at implementation of SFAS No143,
the cumulative effect was reflected as a regulatory asset. Registrant will also reflect the gain or
loss at settlement as a regulatory asset or liability on the balance sheet. With regards to
removal costs associated with certain other long-lived assets, such as water mains, distribution
and transmission assets, asset retirement obligations have not been recognized as these assets
either have indefinite lives or there is no legal obligation to retire the asset. Upon adoption of SFAS No143 on January1, 2003, Registrant recorded the fair value of the
asset retirement obligation of $132million at its net present value of $27million, increased
depreciable assets by $04million for asset retirement costs, increased accumulated depreciation
by $02million and increased regulatory assets by $25million. Amounts recorded under SFAS No.
143 are subject to various assumptions and determinations, such as determining whether a legal
obligation exists to remove assets, and estimating the fair value of the costs of removal, when
final removal will occur and the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates to be utilized on
discounting future liabilities. Changes that may arise over time with regard to these assumptions
will change amounts recorded in the future. Estimating the fair value of the costs of removal were
determined based on third party costs. The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate carrying amount of the
asset retirement obligations ARO which is included in Other Credits on the balance sheets as

If SFAS No143 had been in place on January1, 2002, Registrants ARO as of that date would
not have differed significantly from amounts recorded as of January1, 2003 upon adoption. If the
standard had been applied retroactively for the year ended December31, 2002, it would not have had
any impact on Registrants results of operations. Note 4 Capital Stock During the 2003 annual meeting of shareholders held on May20, 2003, shareholders approved the
elimination of all references to stated value in Registrants Articles of Incorporation. As a
result, a reclassification adjustment of $1016million was made that eliminated Registrants
additional paid-in capital in the year ended December31, 2003. On June7, 2002, Registrant completed a 3-for-2 stock split of Common Shares for the holders
of record on May15, 2002. Earnings per share and number of shares have been retroactively restated
for all periods presented to reflect the stock split. 67 Table of Contents Note 4 Capital Stock Continued AWR had a Registration Statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for
issuance, from time to time, of up to $60million in aggregate in Common Shares, Preferred Shares
and/or debt securities. As of December31, 2004, there are no amounts remaining for issuance under
this Registration Statement. On September22, 2004, AWR issued 1,400,000 shares in a registered
public offering and received proceeds of $334million, net of underwriter fees and other issuance
costs of $20million. The proceeds recorded in Common Shares were reduced by direct issuance
costs. Net proceeds from this sale were used to pay down short-term borrowings under AWRs $75
million syndicated credit facility. On October12, 2004, the underwriters partially exercised an
over-allotment option for an additional 50,000 shares. AWR received proceeds of $1,212,500, which
was net of underwriter fees of $50,500 from the issuance of these shares. In September2004, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of 10 additional SCW Common
Shares to AWR for $280million. SCW used the proceeds to pay down debt owed to AWR. In November
2004, the Board approved the issuance of 2 additional SCW Common Shares to AWR for $71million. During the year ended December31, 2004, Registrant issued 45,262 and 44,588 Common Shares
under the Registrants Common Share Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan DRPand the 401k
Plan, respectively. There are 649,822 and 4,583 Common Shares authorized for issuance directly by
AWR but unissued under the DRP and the 401k Plan, respectively, at December31, 2004. Shares
reserved for the 401k Plan are in relation to AWRs matching contributions and for investment
purposes by participants. During the year ended December31, 2003, Registrant issued 14,295 and
14,735 Common Shares under the Registrants DRP and 401k Plan, respectively. During the year
ended December31, 2002, Registrant issued 30,180 and 31,211 Common Shares under the Registrants
DRP and 401k Plan, respectively. In 1998, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights Plan and authorized
a dividend distribution of one right a Right to purchase 1/1000th of Junior
Participating Preferred Share for each outstanding Common Share. The Rights Plan became effective
in September1998 and will expire in September2008. The Rights Plan is designed to provide
shareholders protection and to maximize shareholder value by encouraging a prospective acquirer to
negotiate with the Board of Directors. Each Right represents a right to purchase 1/1000th of Junior Participating
Preferred Share at the price of $120, subject to adjustment the Purchase Price. Each Junior
Participating Preferred Share is entitled to receive a dividend equal to 1000 times any dividend
paid on each Common Share and 100 votes per share in any shareholder election. The Rights become
exercisable upon occurrence of a Distribution Date event. A Distribution Date event occurs if i
any person accumulates 15% of the then outstanding Common Shares, iiany person presents a tender
offer which caused the persons ownership level to exceed 15% and the Board determines the tender
offer not to be fair to AWRs shareholders, or iiithe Board determines that a shareholder
maintaining a 15% interest in the Common Shares could have an adverse impact on AWR or could
attempt to pressure AWR to repurchase the holders shares at a premium. Until the occurrence of a Distribution Date, each Right trades with the Common Share and is
not separately transferable. When a Distribution Date occurs, AWR would distribute separately
Rights Certificates to Common Shareholders. The Rights would subsequently trade separately from the
Common Shares and each holder of a Right, other than the acquiring person whose Rights will
thereafter be void, will have the right to receive upon exercise at its then current Purchase Price
that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the Purchase Price of the Right. If
AWR merges into the acquiring person or enters into any transaction that unfairly favors the
acquiring person or disfavors AWRs other shareholders, the Right becomes a right to purchase
Common Shares of the acquiring person having a market value of two times the Purchase Price. The Board of Directors may determine that, in certain circumstances, a proposal, which would
cause a distribution of the Rights, is in the best interest of AWRs shareholders. Therefore, the
Board of Directors may, at its option, redeem the Rights at a redemption price of $001 per Right. 68 Table of Contents Note 5 Dividend Limitations On January31, 2005, AWR declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0225 per Common Share. The
dividend, totaling approximately $38million, was paid on March1, 2005 to common shareholders of
record at the close of business on February10, 2005. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, AWR paid quarterly
dividends to the shareholders, totaling approximately $139million or $0888 per share, $134
million or $0884 per share and $132million or $0872 per share, respectively. AWRs ability to
pay cash dividends on its Common Shares outstanding depends primarily upon cash flows from its SCW
subsidiary. SCW is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. SCWs maximum
ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain Note Agreements to the sum of $21million plus
100% of consolidated net income plus the aggregate net cash proceeds received from capital stock
offerings or other instruments convertible into capital stock from various dates. Under the most
restrictive of the Note Agreements, $1951million was available to pay dividends to AWR as of
December31, 2004. Dividends in the amount of $15,750,000, $15,400,000 and $14,630,000 were paid to
AWR by SCW in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The ability of AWR, ASUS and SCW to pay dividends is also restricted by California law. Under
restrictions of the California tests, approximately $894million of retained earnings for AWR was
available to pay dividends to Common Shareholders at December31, 2004. Approximately $878million
was available from the retained earnings of SCW to pay dividends to AWR. At December31, 2004, ASUS
was not allowed to pay dividends to AWR under the California tests. CCWC is subject to contractual restrictions on its ability to pay dividends. CCWCs maximum
ability to distribute dividends is limited to the maintenance of no more than 55% debt in the
capital structure for the quarter immediately preceding the distribution. The ability of CCWC to
pay dividends is also restricted by Arizona law. Under restrictions of the Arizona tests,
approximately $52million was available to pay dividends to AWR at December31, 2004. There were
no dividends distributed from CCWC to AWR in 2004, 2003 or 2002. Note 6 Bank Debt In June2002, AWR established a new $75million syndicated credit facility that will expire on
June5, 2005. Under the terms of this facility, either AWR or SCW may obtain letters of credit for
up to an aggregate of $15million. SCW has obtained letters of credit, in the amount of $11,181,000
in aggregate, including 1a letter of credit with a fee of 075%, which expires June5, 2005, in
the amount of $6,296,000 to a trustee with respect to the variable rate obligation issued by the
Three Valleys Municipal Water District, 2a letter of credit with an annual fee of 075%, which
expires in June2005, in the amount of $700,000 as security for the deductible in the Companys
business automobile insurance policy, 3a letter of credit with a fee of 075%, which expires
March31, 2005 in an amount of $585,000 as security for the purchase of power, and 4an
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $3,600,000 pursuant to a settlement agreement with
Edison to cover Registrants commitment to pay the settlement amount. There were no compensating
balances required. Loans can be obtained at the option of Registrant and bear interest at rates
based on credit ratings and Euro rate margins. At December31, 2004, $45million was outstanding
under this facility, $155million of which was used to fund AWRs activities, $209million was
used to fund SCWs operations and is included in inter-company payables on SCWs balance sheets as
of December31, 2004, $81million was used to fund ASUS activities and $500,000 was used to fund
CCWC activities. AWR plans to review and possibly increase the revolving credit facility prior to
its expiration. As more fully discussed in Note 4, in September2004, AWR issued shares in a registered public
offering and received net proceeds of $334million. The net proceeds from this sale were used to
pay down short-term borrowings under AWRs $75million syndicated credit facility. Registrants short-term borrowing activities excluding letters of credit for the last three
years were as follows

69 Table of Contents Note 7 Long-Term Debt Registrants long-term debt consists primarily of Notes and Debentures. The Company summarizes
its long-term debt in the Statements of Capitalization. No new long-term debt was issued in 2004
and 2003. In October2003, the 582% Notes totaling $12,500,000 matured. Proceeds from short-term
bank borrowings were used to repay the Notes. SCW has no mortgage debt, and leases and other
similar financial arrangements are not material. Redemption of certain long-term debt issues
outstanding as of December31, 2004 and 2003 can be made in whole or in part at the option of SCW
subject to redemption schedules embedded in the agreements particular to each issue. With the
exception of the 956% Notes, the redemption premiums in effect for 2004 and 2003 range up to 7% of
par value. The 956% Notes are subject to a make-whole premium based on 55 basis points above the
applicable Treasury Yield if redeemed prior to 2021. After 2021, the maximum redemption premium is
3% of par value. CCWC has long-term Industrial Development Authority Bonds IDA Bonds and a repayment contract
due in 2006. Substantially all of the utility plant of CCWC is pledged as collateral for its IDA
Bonds. The Bond Agreement, among other things, irequires CCWC to maintain certain financial
ratios, iirestricts CCWCs ability to incur additional debt, make liens, sell, lease or dispose
of assets, merge with another corporation, and pay dividends, and iiirequires CCWC to establish
a debt service reserve fund held in trust for future payments, which totaled $655,017 and $655,760
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. One of the debt covenants is the maintenance of a
debt service coverage ratio of at least 20x, as defined and calculated in the loan and trust
agreement, based on the twelve-month year end results. CCWC violated this debt service coverage
ratio for the twelve-month period ended December31, 2004 and has requested and received a waiver. AWR - Annual maturities of all long-term debt, including capitalized leases, amount to
approximately $880,000, $639,000, $588,000, $611,000, $640,000 and $226,424,000 for the five years
ending December31, 2005 through 2009 and thereafter, respectively. SCW - Annual maturities of all long-term debt, including capitalized leases, amount to
approximately $282,000, $298,000, $308,000, $311,000, $330,000 and $220,450,000 for the five years
ending December31, 2005 through 2009 and thereafter, respectively. Note 8 Taxes on Income Registrant provides deferred income taxes for temporary differences under SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, for certain transactions which are recognized for income tax
purposes in a period different from that in which they are reported in the financial statements.
The most significant items are the tax effects of accelerated depreciation, the supply cost
balancing accounts, and advances for, and contributions-in-aid-of-, construction. SFAS No109 also
requires that rate-regulated enterprises record deferred income taxes for temporary differences
given flow-through treatment at the direction of a regulatory commission. The resulting deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recorded at the expected cash flow to be reflected in future rates.
Given that the CPUC has consistently permitted the recovery of flowed-through tax effects, SCW has
established regulatory liabilities and assets offsetting such deferred tax assets and liabilities
Note 2. Deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably to the nonoperating deferred tax
provision over the lives of the property giving rise to the credits. SCW is included in AWRs consolidated federal income tax and combined state franchise tax
returns. SCWs federal tax liability is computed as if it filed a separate return, and its state
tax liability is computed in a manner consistent with its adopted method for regulatory purposes,
which is computed separately from the AWR Group. 70 Table of Contents Note 8 Taxes on Income Continued The significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as reflected in the

72 Table of Contents Note 8 Taxes on Income Continued In October2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act was signed into law and
provides a new federal income tax deduction from qualified U.S. production activities, which will
be phased in from 2005 through 2010. Under the Act, qualified production activities include
Registrants production of electricity and potable water. In December2004, the FASB issued FASB
Staff Position No109-1 and proposed that the deduction should be accounted for as a special
deduction in accordance with SFAS No109. As such, the special deduction has no effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date. Rather, the impact of this
deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on Registrants tax
return. Regulatory treatment of the deduction has not been established and further guidance from
tax authorities including Treasury Regulations with respect to the deduction is pending.
Accordingly, Registrant is currently evaluating the effect, if any, the Act will have on its
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 9 Employee Benefit Plans Pension and Postretirement Plans Registrant maintains a pension plan the Plan that provides eligible employees those aged
21 and older, with one year of service monthly benefits upon retirement based on average salaries
and length of service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2% of the five highest consecutive
years average earnings multiplied by the number of years of credited service, up to a maximum of 40
years, reduced by a percentage of primary social security benefits. There is also an early
retirement option; however, for terminations on or after January1, 2004, the early retirement
provisions changed to increase benefits under the Plan for employees who retire prior to age 65.
The eligibility requirements for early retirement are age 55 and 5years of vesting service. This
Plan amendment increases Registrants annual pension cost by approximately 5%. Annual
contributions are made to the Plan, which comply with the funding requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act ERISA. Registrant also provides all active employees hired before 1993 medical, dental and vision
care benefits through a medical insurance plan Other Postretirement Benefits. Eligible
employees, who retired prior to age 65, and/or their spouses, were able to retain the benefits
under the plan for active employees until reaching age 65. Eligible employees upon reaching age 65,
and those eligible employees retiring at or after age 65, and/or their spouses, receive coverage
through a Medicare supplement insurance policy paid for by Registrant subject to an annual cap
limit. Registrants postretirement medical plan does not provide prescription drug benefits to
Medicare-eligible employees and is not affected by the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003. The CPUC issued a decision, which provides for the recovery in rates of tax-deductible
contributions made to a separate trust fund. In accordance with that decision, Registrant
established two separate trusts in 1995, one for those retirees who were subject to a collective
bargaining agreement and another for all other retirees. Registrants funding policy is to
contribute annually an amount at least equal to the revenues authorized to be collected through
rates for postretirement benefit costs. Postretirement benefit costs of $16million were recorded
as a regulatory asset for recovery over a 20-year period. The unamortized balance at December31,
2004 and 2003 was $263,028 and $324,852, respectively. At December31, 2004, Registrant had 792 participants in the Plan, 70 of these are employees
subject to collective bargaining arrangements. At December31, 2004 and 2003, the accumulated benefit obligation of the Plan exceeded the
related plan assets at the measurement date. Registrants market related value of plan assets is
equal to the fair value of plan assets. In accordance with accounting standards, Registrants
balance sheets include an additional minimum liability, with a corresponding charge to an
intangible asset and shareholders equity for 2004 through a charge to accumulated other
comprehensive income. The charge to accumulated other comprehensive income OCI would be
restored through shareholders equity in future periods to the extent the fair market value of the
plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation. For tax purposes, Registrant treats pension
and other compensatory items as flow-through items. As such, the tax effect of the OCI has been
reflected as a regulatory tax liability rather than as a tax benefit in OCI. The following table sets forth the Plans funded status and amounts recognized in Registrants
balance sheets and the components of net pension cost and accrued postretirement liability at
December31, 2004 and 2003 73 Table of Contents Note 9 Employee Benefit Plans Continued

Determination of the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the pension plan,
Registrant considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset
class, as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio. This resulted in the
selection of the 70% long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Registrants policy is to fund the medical benefit trusts based on actuarially determined
amounts as allowed in rates. Registrant may invest such funds in qualified instruments to achieve
the desired return objective and minimize recovery through rates. During 2004, the Registrant
invested the funds in the postretirement trusts that will achieve a desired return and minimize
amounts necessary to recover through rates. The mix is expected to provide for a return on assets
similar to the pension plan and to achieve Registrants targeted allocation. This resulted in the
selection of the 7% long-term rate of return on assets assumption. Benefit Payments Registrants estimated future benefit payments at December31, 2004 are as follows in

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Registrant has a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP that provides additional
retirement benefits to certain key employees and officers of the Company by making up benefits,
which are limited by Sections415 and 401a17 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the benefits are unfunded. During 2003, amendments affecting the SERP were approved which increased the related benefit
obligation. The increase was primarily due to an amendment related to a change in the early
retirement provisions. Because the benefits are unfunded, at December31, 2004 and 2003, the
accumulated benefit obligation of the SERP resulted in a negative funded status. In accordance
with accounting standards, Registrants balance sheets include an additional minimum liability,
with a corresponding charge to an intangible asset. 76 Table of Contents Note 9 Employee Benefit Plans Continued The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, funded status of the SERP, as

401k Investment Incentive Program Registrant has a 401k Investment Incentive Program under which employees may invest a
percentage of their pay, up to a maximum investment prescribed by law, in an investment program
managed by an outside investment manager. Registrants cash contributions to the 401k are based
upon a percentage of individual employee contributions and, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, totaled
$1,118,000, $1,032,000 and $976,000, respectively. 77 Table of Contents Note 10 Stock Compensation Plans Stock Incentive Plan Registrant established a 2000 Stock Incentive Plan the 2000 Plan adopted at the annual
meeting of shareholders in 2000 to provide stock-based incentives as a means of promoting the
success of the Company by attracting, retaining and aligning the interests of employees with those
of shareholders generally. There are 750,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the 2000
Plan. Directors Plan Registrant had a Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors. This Non-Employee Directors Plan
provided annual benefits to an eligible director in an amount equal to the annual retainer in
effect at the directors date of retirement. Benefits were payable in monthly installments for a
period equal to the shortest of athe period he or she was a director or b10years. Benefits
were payable to directors after the age of 62 and after retirement from the Board. As of December
31, 2003, the liability recorded for this plan totaled $530,500. On May20, 2003, the Board of
Directors adopted the 2003 Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan New Directors Plan, subject to
shareholder approval. The shareholders approved the New Directors Plan at the May2004 Annual
Meeting. The New Directors Plan provides the non-employee directors with supplemental stock-based
compensation, encourages them to increase their stock ownership in AWR, and terminates the previous
Non-Employee Directors Plan Former Plan. The Former Plan provided for an annual cash retirement
benefit to non-employee directors upon their retirement from service on the Board. Under the New
Directors Plan, participants in the Former Plan were given the opportunity to elect to receive
stock units under the New Directors Plan in lieu of their benefits under the Former Plan. Upon
election to participate in the New Directors Plan by all of the directors, the Former Plan has
ceased to exist. There are 250,000 Common Shares reserved for issuance under the New Directors
Plan. Directors that retired prior to the adoption of the New Directors Plan continue to receive benefits under the Former Plan. Pursuant to the New Directors Plan, non-employee directors will be entitled to receive stock
options and stock unit awards. As of December31, 2004, approximately 12,000 stock options have
been granted to the directors under the New Directors Plan. The stock options were granted at fair
value at the date of grant; therefore no compensation cost has been recognized for these options.
The stock units are a non-voting unit of measurement. As of December31, 2004, the directors have
been credited with approximately 32,400 stock units. Stock units will be paid only in Common Shares
of AWR on the date that the participant terminates service as a director. Upon adoption of the New
Directors Plan in May2004, Registrant began recording compensation expense on the stock unit
awards. For the year ended December31, 2004, Registrant has recorded compensation expense totaling
$799,000 under the New Directors Plan with a corresponding amount to Common Shares in shareholders
equity. Prior to the approval of the New Directors Plan, Registrant had approximately $530,500 of
benefits accrued under the Former Plan which was replaced by the New Directors Plan in May2004.
The initial net impact on earnings of replacing the Former Plan and recording the New Directors
Plan was $247,750 to compensation expense. All stock options under the 2000 Plan and New Directors Plan are granted at the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, accordingly, no compensation expense was
recognized during the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The fair value of stock options
used to compute pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures discussed in Note 1, is the
estimated fair value at grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following

One-third of the stock options granted under the 2000 Stock Incentive Plan become exercisable
on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, but may be exercised earlier if there
is a change in control of the Company. These stock options generally expire ten years from the date
of grant. Under the current terms and conditions of the 2000 Plan, the vesting schedule does not
require continued service through each applicable vesting date as a condition to the vesting of the
applicable installment of the option. Stock options granted under the New Directors Plan vest
immediately. Weighted average remaining contractual life at December31, 2004 is 769years.
Exercise prices of options outstanding at December31, 2004 ranged from $2083 to $2555 per share. Note 11 Business Risks and Commitments Registrants utility operations are engaged in supplying water and electric service to the
public. Registrant is required to provide service and grant credit to customers within its defined
service areas. Although Registrant has a diversified base of residential, industrial and other
customers, revenues derived from commercial and residential water customers accounted for
approximately 91% of total water revenues in 2004, which is about the same percentage as in 2003
and 2002. Registrant faces additional risks associated with weather conditions, adequacy and
quality of water supplies, regulatory decisions, pronouncements and laws, water-related litigation,
and general business conditions. Although consumption remained relatively flat in 2004 compared to
2003, cooler and wetter weather conditions experienced in 2003 in most of SCWs service areas as
compared to 2002 resulted in a decrease in water demand. SCWs Water Supply SCWs obtains its water supply from its operating wells and purchases from others, principally
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California MWD. The MWD is a water district organized
under the laws of the State of California for the purpose of delivering imported water to areas
within its jurisdiction. Registrant has 58 connections to the water distribution facilities of MWD
and other municipal water agencies. MWD imports water from two principal sources: the Colorado
River and the State Water Project. Available water supplies from the Colorado River and the State
Water Project have historically been sufficient to meet most of MWDs requirements. On October17, 2003 the Federal government, the State government, and four Southern California
water agency officials, including the MWD, met to sign the Quantification Settlement Agreement
QSAthat divides up each states share of the Colorado River. Under the QSA, MWD will have access
as in the past to Colorado River water and additional acre feet of water that the Imperial
Irrigation District proposes to conserve and sell to the state. With the signing of this agreement,
California once again has access to excess Colorado River water for the next 13years. MWD has also
publicly stated that it is stepping up a number of efforts including desalination, conservation,
recycling, transfer and storage, to increase water supplies. 79 Table of Contents Note 11 Business Risks and Commitments Continued To meet its water supply needs, SCW has contracts with various governmental entities and other
parties to purchase water or water rights for an aggregate amount of $697million. Included in
this amount as of December31, 2004 is $623million that remains outstanding under purchase
agreements with governmental entities which expire on an agreement by agreement basis commencing in
2008 through 2012. Each of these contracts contain minimum take or pay provisions with the terms
and conditions for pricing under each contract varying. SCW plans to continue to purchase and use
at least the minimum water requirement under the respective contracts in the future. The amount of
the remaining obligations was estimated based on current rates per acre-foot. These rates may be
changed annually. Also included in the $697million is a remaining commitment of $31million
under an agreement with the City of Claremont to lease water rights that were ascribed to the City
as part of the Six Basins adjudication. The initial term of the agreement expires in 2028. SCW
has an option to renew this agreement for 10 more years. Registrants estimated future minimum payments under these commitments at December31, 2004 are as follows,

CCWCs Water Supply CCWC obtains its water supply from two operating wells and from Colorado River water delivered
by the Central Arizona Project CAP. The majority of CCWCs water supply is obtained from its
CAP allocation and well water is used for peaking capacity in excess of treatment plant capability,
during treatment plant shutdown, and to keep the well system in optimal operating condition. CCWC has an assured water supply designation, by decision and order of the Arizona Department
of Water Resources ADWR, providing in part that, subject to its requirements, CCWC has a
sufficient supply of groundwater and CAP water which is physically, continuously and legally
available to satisfy current and committed demands of its customers, plus at least two years of
predicted demands, for 100years. On April7, 2004 the ADWR issued a decision confirming that CCWC has
demonstrated the physical, legal and continuous availability of CAP water and groundwater, in an
aggregate volume of 9,828 acre-feet per year for a minimum of 100years. The Arizona Water Settlement Act was signed into law in December of 2004. This legislation
provides for an additional CAP allocation to CCWC in the amount of 1,931 acre-feet per year. In
order to receive this additional allocation, CCWC must enter into a revised contract with the
Central Arizona Conservation District the District. CCWC expects an agreement to be reached on
this amendment during 2005. Once a revised contract with the District is executed, CCWC expects to
apply to the ADWR to modify and increase its designation of assured supply from 9,828 acre-feet per
year to 11,759 acre-feet per year. CCWC has entered into a commitment with the District to purchase the 1,931 acre-feet of water per year of additional CAP water rights for an estimated amount of $11million as of
December31, 2004. The price will be subject to further adjustment and is expected to
increase until final written agreement is executed. In addition, CCWC has a long-term water supply contract with the
District through September2033, and is entitled to take 6,978 acre-feet of water per year from
CAP. The maintenance rate for such water delivered is set by the District and is subject to annual
increases. The estimated remaining commitment under this contract is $57million as of December
31, 2004 with $195,000 paid each year. Notwithstanding an assured water supply designation, CCWCs water supply may be subject to
interruption or reduction, in particular owing to interruption or reduction of CAP water. In the
event of interruption or reduction of CAP water, CCWC can currently rely on its well water supplies
for short-term periods. However, in any event, the quantity of water CCWC supplies to some or all
of its customers may be interrupted or curtailed, pursuant to the provisions of its tariffs. CCWC
also has the physical capability to deliver water far in excess of that which is currently
accounted for in CCWCs assured water supply
account. 80 Table of Contents Note 11 Business Risks and Commitments Continued Bear Valley Electric Most of the electric energy sold by SCW to customers in its Bear Valley Electric customer
service area is purchased from others. In March2001, SCW entered into a five-year nine-month,
block forward purchase contract with Mirant Marketing to supply its Bear Valley Electric customer
service area with 15 MWs of electric energy at a price of $95 per MWh beginning April1, 2001
through December31, 2006. SCW filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the rates in the
Mirant Marketing contract to a just and reasonable price. The FERC has denied this complaint and
SCW has appealed this denial. In June2001, SCW also executed a three-year, block forward purchase agreement with PWCC for
an additional 8 MWs of electric energy to meet Bear Valley Electrics peak winter demands at a
price of $75 per MWh for the first year, $48 per MWh for the second year and $36 per MWh for the
third year. Effective November2002, SCW entered into a series of purchase power contracts with PWCC.
Under the agreements, SCW will exchange 15 MWs of electric energy with PWCC at $7465 per MWh that
results in an upfront payment by PWCC of $2035 per MWh for 15 MWs over the period beginning
November1, 2002 through December31, 2006. This upfront payment is being recorded as a reduction
of purchased power costs that are included in the supply cost balancing account. In addition, 8
MWs of electric energy are also being sold to PWCC at the prices set forth in the June2001 energy
purchase agreement with PWCC, and 8 MWs are being purchased at $7465 per MWh beginning on November
1, 2002 through March31, 2003 and each succeeding November 1 through March31 through March31,
2008 and for the period November1, 2008 through December31, 2008. Total commitments under these
agreements amounted to $744million, of which $479million remains outstanding as of December31,
2004, with approximately $12million due each year through December31, 2008. The average minimum load at SCWs Bear Valley Electric customer service area has been
approximately 12 MWs. The average winter load has been 18 MWs with a winter peak of 39 MWs when the
snowmaking machines at the ski resorts are operating. On July17, 2002, the CPUC approved a settlement agreement reached among SCW, all
intervening parties and the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, which permits SCW to recover $77 per MWh
of purchased power costs through rates, effective immediately thereafter. SCW will only be allowed
to include up to a weighted annual energy purchase cost of $77 per MWh each year through August
2011, in its balancing account. To the extent SCWs actual average annual weighted cost for
purchased power is less than $77 per MWh, the differential will recover amounts included in the
electric supply balancing account. Conversely, to the extent that actual average annual weighted
costs for power purchased exceed the $77 per MWh amount, SCW will not be able to include these
amounts in its balancing account and such amounts will be expensed. In 2004, 2003 and 2002,
approximately $195,000, $240,000 and $718,000, respectively, were expensed. As a result of the
settlement, SCW is also permitted to collect a surcharge of 22 per kilowatt hour from its
customers for up to ten years commencing August2001 to allow SCW an opportunity to collect amounts
remaining in its electric cost balancing account, with interest, incurred by SCW during the energy
crisis in 2000-2001. SCW owns a natural gas-fueled 84 MW generation facility that went on line during August of
2004, and should assist SCW in controlling its spot purchase prices and in meeting increasing
demand in its Bear Valley Electric customer service area. The ability of SCW to deliver purchased power to customers in its Bear Valley Electric service
area is limited by the ability of the transmission facilities owned by Southern California Edison
Company Edison to transmit this power. SCW filed a lawsuit against Edison in 2000 for breach of
contract as a result of delays in upgrading these transmission facilities as well as for other
reasons. In March2004, SCW and Edison agreed to settle this suit. Under the terms of the
agreement, SCW agreed to pay a $5million project abandonment fee to Edison. Edison filed an
application to the FERC for approval of the entire $5million settlement payment as abandoned
project cost to be included in Edisons wholesale rate charged to SCW. In addition, Edison is to
sell the Goldhill substation and associated transmission line to SCW at its book value. Management
believed that the FERCs approval of Edisons filing was probable and the abandonment costs
included in Edisons wholesale rate to SCW would be recoverable through rates. As a result, the $5
million obligation to Edison arising from the settlement was recorded as a regulatory asset during
the fourth quarter of 2003. 81 Table of Contents Note 11 Business Risks and Commitments Continued SCW made an initial lump sum payment of $14million to Edison during the first quarter of
2004 and agreed to pay Edison an additional $36million over a 15year term through 180 equal
monthly payments of $38,137. In August2004, the FERC approved Edisons application and SCW
recorded the $14million payment in the electric supply cost balancing account. This amount was
previously recorded as a regulatory asset pending FERC approval of Edisons application. In
addition, monthly payments totaling $228,822 made to Edison during the year ended December31, 2004
are also included in the electric supply cost balancing account. Operating Leases Registrant leases equipment and facilities primarily for its Regional and District offices
under non-cancelable operating leases with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates. Rent
expense for leases that contain scheduled rent increases are recorded on a straight-line basis.
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, Registrants consolidated rent expense was $2,554,912, $2,187,008 and
$1,992,889, respectively. Registrants future minimum payments under long-term non-cancelable

There is no material difference between the consolidated operations of AWR and the operations
of SCW in regards to the future minimum payments under long-term non-cancelable operating leases. Note 12 Contingencies Water Quality-Related Litigation SCW was named as a defendant in twenty-two lawsuits that alleged that SCW and other water
utilities, delivered unsafe water to their customers. Plaintiffs in these actions sought damages,
including general, special, and punitive damages, according to proof at trial, as well as
attorneys fees on certain causes of action, costs of suit, and other unspecified relief. Nineteen
of the lawsuits were coordinated in the Los Angeles Superior Court the Court and involved water
served by SCW in the San Gabriel Valley and Pomona Valley areas of Los Angeles County in the
southern portion of California; three of the lawsuits involved a customer service area located in
Sacramento County in northern California. On August4, 2004, SCW was ordered dismissed from all nineteen cases involving customer
service areas located in the San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys of Los Angeles County. The order was
issued by the Trial Judge presiding over these matters, and followed a lengthy legal proceeding
dating back to April1997 when the first of the cases was filed by over 140 customers in the San
Gabriel Valley, alleging their water had caused personal injuries of varying types and degrees. The
Court found SCW did not violate established water quality standards and dismissed the cases after
allowing reasonable time and opportunity for the Plaintiffs to prove otherwise. SCW has long
asserted that it meets or exceeds the requirements to provide water within the standards
established by the health authorities. On September21, 2004, SCW received notice that several
plaintiffs filed an appeal to the trial courts order to dismiss SCW. SCW is unable to predict the
outcome of this appeal. As for the three lawsuits in Sacramento County, one of the three Plaintiffs
filed for dismissal in July2004 and the case has subsequently been dismissed by the Court. On
October15, 2004, the remaining two claims were also ordered dismissed by the Court. The claims
have been permanently dismissed since the Plaintiffs failed to file a Notice of Appeal within the
allotted time of 60days. SCW is subject to self-insured retention provisions in its applicable insurance policies and
has either expensed the self-insured amounts or has reserved against payment of these amounts as
appropriate. SCWs various insurance carriers have, to date, provided reimbursement for costs
incurred above the self-insured amounts for defense against these lawsuits, subject to a
reservation of rights. In addition, the CPUC has issued certain decisions, which authorize SCW to
establish a memorandum account to accumulate costs to comply with certain contamination remediation
requirements for future recovery. 82 Table of Contents Note 12 Contingencies Continued Aerojet On October25, 1999, SCW sued Aerojet-General Aerojet for causing the contamination of
eastern portions of the Sacramento County groundwater basin. On October10, 2003, Registrant
entered into a confidential Memorandum of Understanding MOU with Aerojet for the settlement of
legal actions brought by SCW. The MOU set forth the financial terms and the structure of a
settlement to cover, over time, capital and litigation related costs incurred by SCW resulting from
the contamination. The MOU and the settlement embodied therein were found to be binding by the
Sacramento Superior Court on January18, 2004. On October12, 2004, Registrant reached a final
settlement with Aerojet based on the terms of the MOU. Under the terms of the settlement, Aerojet paid SCW $87million in the first quarter of 2004.
Aerojet has also agreed to pay SCW an additional $8million, plus interest, over a five year period
beginning in December2009. The $87million payment and guaranteed future payments have been
applied directly to reduce SCWs costs of utility plant and purchased water by $16million and
$735,000, respectively. Prior to the MOU, Aerojet had reimbursed SCW $43million in capital costs
and $171,000 for additional water supply. Aerojet has also agreed to reimburse SCW $175million,
plus interest accruing from January1, 2004, for its past legal and expert costs. The recovery of
the $175million is contingent upon the issuance of land use approvals in a defined area in
Eastern Sacramento County and the receipt of certain fees in connection with such development. Aerojet will also transfer its remediated groundwater to the Sacramento County Water Agency,
which will provide treated water for distribution to SCW and other water purveyors affected by the
contamination. SCW has entered into an agreement with Sacramento County Water Agency to receive
water as outlined above. As a result of this arrangement and other mitigation measures, SCW should
have a reliable water supply for its Rancho Cordova service area. Registrant and Aerojet have also signed three separate agreements requiring Aerojet to pay for
certain transmission pipelines and upgrades to Registrants Coloma Treatment Plant as a contingency
plan, should additional wells be impacted. The value of the three agreements approximates $68
million in capital improvements. The facilities are expected to be fully operational by the end of
2005. In 2000, the CPUC authorized the establishment of a memorandum account into which SCW was
allowed to record costs it incurred in prosecuting the contamination suits filed against the State
and Aerojet. The CPUC also authorized SCW periodically to seek recovery of such recorded costs from
ratepayers. In that regard, SCW sought interim cost recovery and was authorized to increase rates,
effective April28, 2001, in an amount sufficient over a six-year period to offset approximately
$18million in such legal and expert costs recorded in the memorandum account that had been
incurred on or before August31, 2000. As of December31, 2004, approximately $153million in
legal and consulting related costs, including the unamortized portion of the $18million, has been
recorded as deferred charges and included in Regulatory Assets on the SCW balance sheets. In a proceeding currently pending at the CPUC, SCW has requested a twenty-year amortization of
the remaining balance of the costs recorded in the memorandum account, net of any reimbursement
amounts received from defendants, insurers and others. Given the expected timing for the issuance
of a final decision in this proceeding third quarter 2005, SCW filed a motion seeking another
interim amortization in December2004. In this motion, SCW proposed to amortize $6million of the
$153million of the memorandum account balance over a 10year period, and to increase rates
accordingly, subject to refund. In January2005, a joint ruling of the assigned Commissioner and
Administrative Law Judge denied SCWs request for an interim amortization. The motion was denied
primarily because the hearing on the merits was only weeks away March14-15, 2005 and an expected
proposed decision, and CPUC action on it, may be soon thereafter in the second or third quarter of
2005. Management remains of the opinion that the recovery of these costs through rates is probable;
however, management cannot give assurance that the CPUC will ultimately allow recovery of all or
any of the costs that have accumulated in this memorandum account. Management will continue to
monitor the rate making process for this matter and assess the probability of recovery of these
costs on a quarterly basis. Furthermore, it is managements intention to offset any settlement
proceeds from Aerojet against the balance in the memorandum account at the time of receipt of the
settlement payments. 83 Table of Contents Note 12 Contingencies Continued Other Water Quality Litigation Perchlorate and/or Volatile Organic Compounds VOChave been detected in five wells servicing
SCWs San Gabriel System. SCW filed suit, along with two other affected water purveyors and the San
Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority WQA, in federal court against some of those responsible for
the contamination. Some of the other potential defendants settled with SCW, other water purveyors
and the WQA the Water Entities on VOC related issues prior to the filing of the lawsuit. In
response to the filing of the Federal lawsuit, the Potentially Responsible Party PRPdefendants
filed motions to dismiss the suit or strike certain portions of the suit. The judge issued a ruling
on April1, 2003 granting in part and denying in part the defendants motions. A key ruling of the
court was that the water purveyors, including the Registrant, by virtue of their ownership of wells
contaminated with hazardous chemicals are themselves PRPs under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA. Registrant has, pursuant to permission of the
court, amended its suit to claim certain affirmative defenses as an innocent party under CERCLA.
In this same suit, the PRPs have filed cross-complaints against the Registrant, the other two
affected water purveyors, the WQA and the Metropolitan Water District, the Main San Gabriel Basin
Watermaster and others on the theory that they arranged for and did transport contaminated water
into the Basin for use by Registrant and the other two affected water providers and for other
related claims. Registrant is presently unable to predict the outcome of this ruling on its ability
to fully recover from the PRPs future costs associated with the treatment of these wells. On August29, 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued Unilateral Administrative
Orders UAO against 41 parties deemed responsible for polluting the groundwater in that portion
of the San Gabriel Valley from which SCWs two impacted wells draw water. SCW was not named as a
party to the UAO. The UAO requires that these parties remediate the contamination. The judge in the
Federal lawsuit has appointed a special master to oversee mandatory settlement discussions between
the PRPs and the Water Entities. EPA is also conducting settlement discussions with several PRPs,
including those which previously settled with the Water Entities on VOC matters regarding the UAO.
The Water Entities and EPA are working to coordinate their settlement discussions in order to
arrive at a complete resolution of all issues affecting the Federal lawsuits and the UAO.
Registrant is presently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these settlement discussions. Condemnation of Properties The laws of the State of California and the State of Arizona provide for the acquisition of
public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, also know
as condemnation, where doing so is in the public interest. In addition, however, the laws of the
State of California also provide: 1that the owner of the utility property may contest whether
the condemnation is actually in the public interest; and 2that the owner is entitled to receive
the fair market value of its property if the property is ultimately taken. Although the City of
Claremont, California located in SCWs Region III, has not initiated the formal condemnation
process pursuant to California law, the City has expressed various concerns to the Company about
the rates charged by the Company and the effectiveness of the CPUCs rate setting procedures. The
City has also hired a consultant to perform an appraisal of the value of Registrants water system
serving that city. Such value was determined by the consultant at $46million. SCW is currently
meeting with the City to discuss various concepts such as a public private partnership where the
City and the Company could work together to resolve the Citys concerns. While the City has
publicly disclosed some of its proposals in its City Council meetings, to date, there has been no
agreement reached between the Company and the City that alleviates the Citys concerns. Except for
the City of Claremont, Registrant has not been, within the last three years, involved in activities
related to the condemnation of any of its water customer service areas or in its Bear Valley
Electric customer service area. As of December31, 2004, the recorded net book value of the
Claremont water system is approximately $33million. 84 Table of Contents Note 12 Contingencies Continued Santa Maria Groundwater Basin Adjudication In 1997, the Santa Maria Valley Water Conservation District plaintifffiled a lawsuit
against multiple defendants, including SCW, the City of Santa Maria, and several other public water
purveyors. The plaintiffs lawsuit seeks an adjudication of the Santa Maria Groundwater Basin.
After some procedural rulings by the superior court, the lawsuit is now a full basin adjudication
involving all entities owning 10 acres or more within the Basin boundaries approximately 1,400
defendants. The plaintiffs stated objective in the adjudication lawsuit is to have the superior
court impose and oversee the implementation of a Basin management plan that ensures the long term
integrity and reliability of the Basin water resources. To protect its groundwater supply so that
sufficient water production rights continue to be available to meet SCWs customers needs in the
Santa Maria customer service area, SCW has been vigorously defending its water rights in the
adjudication lawsuit. As of December31, 2004, SCW has incurred costs in defending its rights in
the Basin, including legal and expert witness fees, which have been deferred in Utility Plant for
rate recovery. Management believes that when the adjudication lawsuit is finally resolved, SCW will
have secured its right to pump groundwater from the Basin and to continue to rely on the Basin as a
source of supply for its customers needs. Management also believes that the recovery of these
costs through rates is probable; however, management cannot give assurance that the CPUC will
ultimately allow recovery of all or any of the costs that have accumulated with this lawsuit. Other Litigation Registrant is also subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business. Other
than those disclosed above, no other legal proceedings are pending, which are believed to be
material. Management believes that rate recovery, proper insurance coverage and reserves are in
place to insure against property, general liability and workers compensation claims incurred in
the ordinary course of business. Note 13 Construction Program Construction Program SCW maintains an ongoing water distribution main replacement program throughout its customer
service areas based on the priority of leaks detected, fire protection enhancement and a reflection
of the underlying replacement schedule. In addition, SCW upgrades its electric and water supply
facilities in accordance with industry standards, local requirements and CPUC requirements. SCWs
Board of Directors has approved anticipated net capital expenditures for 2005 principally
reflecting water supply related projects such as drilling and equipping of new wells, building a
new reservoir, and distribution and street improvement projects. As of December31, 2004, SCW has
unconditional purchase obligations for capital projects of approximately $288million. CCWCs
Board of Directors has approved a net capital budget for 2005 primarily reflecting a new treatment
center building and distribution improvement on its Golden Eagle Plant. AWR and ASUS have no
material capital commitments. However, ASUS actively seeks opportunities to own, lease or operate
water and wastewater systems for governmental entities, which may involve significant capital
commitments. FBWS has capital commitments that are being funded by the U.S Government. 85 Table of Contents Note 14 Business Segments AWR has three principal business units: water and electric distribution units, through its SCW
subsidiary, a water-service utility operation conducted through its CCWC unit, and a contracted
services unit through the ASUS subsidiary. All activities of SCW currently are geographically
located within California. All activities of CCWC are located in the state of Arizona. All
activities of ASUS are conducted in California, Arizona and Texas. Both SCW and CCWC are regulated
utilities. On a stand-alone basis, AWR has no material assets other than its investments in its
subsidiaries. The tables below set forth information relating to SCWs operating segments, CCWC and
ASUSs contract services businesses as well as the operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, FBWS.
Included in the amounts set forth, certain assets, revenues and expenses have been allocated. The
identifiable assets are net of respective accumulated provisions for depreciation. Capital
additions reflect capital expenditures paid in cash and exclude property installed by developers
and conveyed to the Company.

The second quarter of 2004 reflects the following   
a $52million net pretax gain on the sale of water rights reflecting a
favorable CPUC decision on July8, 2004. As discussed previously, $57million
was received which represents settlement proceeds received in May2004 from the
City of Santa Monica relating to the sale and the assignment of rights regarding
the Charnock Groundwater Basin. The total proceeds of $57million from the sale
and the assignment of rights were offset by an impairment loss of $482,000
associated with assets removed from rate base, pursuant to the decision. SCW
recorded the impairment loss on assets removed from rate-base in other
operating expenses.     
a $22million pretax charge to earnings to reflect the recording of the net
over-collection in the memorandum supply cost accounts as a result of SCWs
filing of advice letters on April30, 2004 with the CPUC.    2
The third quarter of 2004 reflects the recording of approximately $2million
pretax related to additional revenues associated with the Region II rate increase
approved by the CPUC in August2004. The rate increases in SCWs Region II customer
service area were retroactive to February14, 2004. 88 Table of Contents Note 17 Selected Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited Continued

Fourth quarter of 2003 reflects the following   
a $35million pretax charge to earnings to reflect a Proposed Decision
issued by the CPUC Note 2. As required by the Proposed Decision issued by the
CPUC on December19, 2003, SCW will be required to refund to customers
approximately $35million in net proceeds received from potentially responsible
parties since 1998 for the contamination of the Companys groundwater supply.     
a $62million pretax charge to earnings to reflect a decision issued
by the CPUC on March16, 2004. The decision ordered SCW to refund 70percent of
the total amount of lease revenues received from the City of Folsom since 1994,
plus interest, to customers Note 2. 89 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of American States Water Company We have completed an integrated audit of American States Water Companys 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004
and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our
audits, are presented below. Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index, present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American States Water Company and its
subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for asset retirement costs as of January1, 2003. Internal control over financial reporting Also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, appearing under Item9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 90 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

March15, 2005 91 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and
Shareholder of Southern California Water Company In our opinion, the
accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of income,
shareholders
equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern
California Water Company SCW at December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of SCWs management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. As discussed in Note 1 to the combined financial statements, SCW changed the manner in which it
accounts for asset retirement costs as of January1, 2003. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

March15, 2005 92 Table of Contents Report from Management on the Responsibility for Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements contained in the annual report were prepared by the
management of American States Water Company, which is responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include, where necessary, amounts
based upon managements best estimates and judgments. All other financial information in the annual
report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and is also the responsibility of
management. The Audit Committee, composed of three outside directors, exercises oversight of managements
discharge of its responsibilities regarding the systems of internal control and financial
reporting. The committee periodically meets with management, the internal auditor and the
independent accountants to review the work and findings of each. The committee also reviews the
qualifications of, and recommends to the board of directors, a firm of independent registered
public accountants. Registrants independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is engaged
to audit the consolidated financial statements included in this report in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States and to express an
opinion on whether those consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material
respects, Registrants results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition,
managements assessment of the effectiveness of Registrants internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The result of
their work is expressed in their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
