NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 A. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Coventry Health Care, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, the Company or Coventry is a diversified national managed health care company based in Bethesda, Maryland operating health plans, insurance companies, network rental and workers compensation services companies. Through its Health Plan and Medical Services, Specialized Managed Care and Workers Compensation reportable segments, the Company provides a full range of risk and fee-based managed care products and services to a broad cross section of individuals, employer and government-funded groups, government agencies, and other insurance carriers and administrators. Since the Company began operations in 1987 with the acquisition of the American Service Companies entities, including Coventry Health and Life Insurance Company, the Company has grown substantially through acquisitions. See Note C, Acquisitions, to the consolidated financial statements for information on the Companys recent acquisitions. Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated.Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant Customers The Companys health plan commercial risk products are diversified across a large customer base and no customer group comprises 10% or more of Coventrys managed care premiums. The Company received 327%, 356% and 507% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from the federal Medicare program throughout its various health plan markets and from national Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage Private-Fee-For-Service Medicare PFFS products.The decline in 2011 is primarily due to lower Medicare Part D membership as a result of the loss of auto assign regions as well as a reduction in product offerings from five in 2010 to two in 2011. The decline in 2010 is primarily a result of the Companys non-renewal of the Medicare PFFS product effective January 1, 2010. The Company also received 125%, 109% and 84% of its managed care premiums for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, from state-sponsored Medicaid programs throughout its various health plan markets. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the State of Missouri accounted for 369%, 452%, and 512% of the Companys Medicaid premiums.Additionally, the Company received 100%, 112% and 113% of its management services revenue from a single customer, Mail Handlers Benefit Plan MHBP, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and Treasury bills. The Company considers all highly liquid securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments The Company accounts for investments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 320-10, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, ASC Topic 320-10-35-35, Accounting for Debt Securities After an Other-than-Temporary Impairment, and Accounting Standards Update ASU 2010-06, Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements.The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of ASU 2010-06.The Company invests primarily in fixed income securities and classifies all of its investments as available-for-sale. Investments are evaluated on an individual security basis at least quarterly to determine if declines in value are other-than-temporary. In making that determination, the Company considers all available evidence relating to the realizable value of a security. This evidence is reviewed at the individual security level and includes, but is not limited to, the following the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry or geographic area the historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  59 Table of Contents the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date; and if the Company has decided to sell the security or it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost. For debt securities, if the Company intends to either sell or determines that it will more-likely-than-not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security, the Company recognizes the entire impairment in earnings.If the Company does not intend to sell the debt security and the Company determines that it will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell the debt security but it does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis, the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and all other cases, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on the sale of investments are determined on a specific identification basis. Investments with original maturities in excess of three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments and generally consist of corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury notes and commercial paper. Long-term investments have original maturities in excess of one year and primarily consist of fixed income securities. Other Receivables Other receivables include pharmacy rebate receivables of $2805 million and $3107 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.Other receivables also include Medicare Part D program related risk share and subsidy receivables discussed below under Revenue Recognition, Medicare risk adjuster receivables, Office of Personnel Management OPM receivables, interest receivables, and any other receivables that do not relate to premiums.The increase in other receivables during 2011 primarily resulted from the net Medicare Part D subsidy receivables reinsurance subsidy, low-income subsidy and coverage gap subsidy related to the 2011 plan year that we expect to collect when the plan year is settled in 2012. Other Current Assets Other Current Assets primarily include deferred tax assets and also includes prepaid expenses.See Note J, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Property and Equipment Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated lives of the related assets or over the term of the respective leases, if applicable.The estimated useful lives of the Companys property and equipment are between three to thirty years.In accordance with ASC 350-40, Internal-Use Software, the cost of internally developed software is capitalized and included in property and equipment. The Company capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal-use software. These costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll-related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal-use software project. See Note F, Property and Equipment, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Long-term Assets Long-term assets primarily include assets associated with senior note issuance costs and reinsurance recoveries. The reinsurance recoveries were obtained with the acquisition of First Health Group Corporation FHGC and are related to certain life insurance receivables from a third party insurer for liabilities that have been ceded to that third party insurer. Business Combinations, Accounting for Goodwill and Other Intangibles The Company accounts for Business Combinations in accordance with ASC Topic 805-10, Business Combinations and accounts for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with ASCTopic 350-10, Intangibles Goodwill and Other and ASU 2011-08, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic 350:Testing Goodwill for Impairment.Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. The Companys annual impairment test date is October 1 of each fiscal year.The Company has five reporting units: Health Plans, Workers Compensation, MHNet, Medicare Part D, and Network Rental.For goodwill, the Company performs a multi-step impairment test. First, the Company measures the fair value of each reporting unit and compares it to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. The market approach estimates the reporting units fair value by utilizing market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. The income approach is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then the Company must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the Company records an impairment charge equal to the difference.Impairment charges are recorded in the period incurred. See Note E, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to these assets.  60 Table of Contents The fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is estimated and compared to the carrying value.The Company estimates the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset using an income approach. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value. Other acquired intangible assets are separately recognized upon meeting certain criteria. Such intangible assets include, but are not limited to, trade and service marks, health provider contracts, customer lists and licenses. An intangible asset that is subject to amortization is tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company amortizes other acquired intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from three to 20 years. Discontinued Operations The Company accounts for discontinued operations in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.The Company determines whether the group of assets being disposed of comprises a component of the entity, which requires cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the entity.The Company also determines whether the cash flows associated with the group of assets have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the disposal transaction and whether the Company has no significant continuing involvement in the operations of the group of assets after disposal.If these determinations result in an affirmative response, the results of operations of the asset group being disposed of, as well as the gain or loss on disposal are aggregated for separate presentation apart from the continuing operating results of the Company in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.See Note D, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure related to discontinued operations. Medical Liabilities and Expense Medical liabilities consist of actual claims reported but not paid and estimates of health care services incurred but not reported. The estimated claims incurred but not reported are based on historical data, current enrollment, health service utilization statistics and other related information. In determining medical liabilities, the Company employs standard actuarial reserve methods that are specific to each markets membership, product characteristics, geographic territories and provider network. The Company also considers utilization frequency and unit costs of inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy and other medical expenses, as well as claim payment backlogs and the timing of provider reimbursements. The Company also establishes reserves, if required, for the probability that anticipated future health care costs and contract maintenance costs under the group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries on those contracts. These accruals are continually monitored and reviewed, and as settlements are made or accruals adjusted, differences are reflected in current operations. Changes in assumptions for medical costs caused by changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term.  61 Table of Contents The following table presents the components of the change in medical claims liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively dollars in thousands.  2011 2010 2009 Medical liabilities, beginning of year 1,237,690 1,605,407 1,446,391  Acquisitions 1 71,548  Reported Medical Costs Current year 9,163,009 8,507,460 11,049,227 Prior year development 121,607 241,513 189,833 Total reported medical costs 9,041,402 8,265,947 10,859,394  Claim Payments Payments for current year 7,953,744 7,491,891 9,598,222 Payments for prior year 989,783 1,185,476 1,123,131 Total claim payments 8,943,527 8,677,367 10,721,353  Change in Part D Related Subsidy Liabilities 27,058 27,845 20,975  Medical liabilities, end of year 1,308,507 1,237,690 1,605,407  Supplemental Information  Prior year development 2 15 22 21 Current year paid percent 3 868 881 869  1 Acquisition balances represent medical liabilities of the acquired company as of the applicable acquisition date.  2 Prior year reported medical costs in the current year as a percentage of prior year reported medical costs.  3 Current year claim payments as a percentage of current year reported medical costs. The negative medical cost amounts noted as prior year development are favorable adjustments for claim estimates being settled for amounts less than originally anticipated. As noted above, these favorable developments from original estimates occur due to changes in medical utilization, mix of provider rates and other components of medical cost trends. Medical claim liabilities are generally paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the 2011 prior year development relates almost entirely to claims incurred in calendar year 2010. The change in Medicare Part D related subsidy liabilities identified in the table above represent subsidy amounts received from Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS for reinsurance, coverage gap and for cost sharing related to low-income individuals. These subsidies are recorded in medical liabilities and the Company does not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies. Other Long-term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, liability for unrecognized tax benefits and liabilities associated with the 401k Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plan. Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes net earnings and unrealized net gains and losses on investment securities. Other comprehensive income is net of reclassification adjustments to adjust for items currently included in net earnings, such as realized gains and losses on investment securities. The deferred tax provision for holding gains arising from investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $183 million, $41 million, and $253 million, respectively.The deferred tax provision for reclassification adjustments for gains included in net earnings on investment securities during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $65 million, $43 million, and $45 million, respectively.  62 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Managed care premiums are recorded as revenue in the month in which members are entitled to service. Premiums are based on a per subscriber contract rate and the subscribers in the Companys records at the time of billing. Premium billings are generally sent to employers in the month preceding the month of coverage. Premium billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in membership as a result of retroactive terminations, additions or other changes.Payments received in advance of the period of coverage are recognized as deferred revenue. The Company also receives premium payments from CMS on a monthly basis for its Medicare membership. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with CMS and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue.CMS uses a risk adjustment model to determine premium payments to health plans.This risk adjustment model apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity based on diagnosis data provided to CMS.The Company estimates risk adjustment revenues based on the diagnosis data submitted to CMS.Changes in revenue from CMS resulting from the periodic changes in risk adjustments scores for the Companys membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company also receives premium payments on a monthly basis from the state Medicaid programs with which the Company contracts for the Medicaid members for whom it provides health coverage. Membership and category eligibility are periodically reconciled with the state Medicaid programs and such reconciliations could result in adjustments to revenue. Premiums collected in advance are recorded as deferred revenue. The Medicare Part D program gives beneficiaries access to prescription drug coverage.The Company has been awarded contracts by CMS to offer various Medicare Part D plans on a nationwide basis, in accordance with guidelines put forth by the agency. Payments from CMS under these contracts include amounts for premiums, amounts for risk corridor adjustments, and amounts for coverage gap, reinsurance and low-income cost subsidies. Subsidy amounts received from CMS for coverage gap, reinsurance and for cost sharing related to low-income individuals are recorded in medical liabilities and will offset medical costs when paid. The Company does not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these subsidies as the Company does not incur any risk with this part of the program. A reconciliation of the final risk sharing, low-income subsidy and reinsurance subsidy amounts is performed following the end of each contract year.A reconciliation of the coverage gap discount subsidies is performed quarterly. The Company recognizes premium revenue for the Medicare Part D program ratably over the contract period for providing insurance coverage. Regarding the CMS risk corridor provision, an estimated risk sharing receivable or payable is recognized based on activity-to-date. Activity for CMS risk sharing is accumulated at the contract and plan benefit package level and recorded within the consolidated balance sheet in other receivables or other accrued liabilities depending on the net contract balance at the end of the reporting period with corresponding adjustments to premium revenue. Costs for covered prescription drugs are expensed as incurred. The table below summarizes the CMS receivables and payables, for all contract years, at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively in thousands.  December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 Total Medicare Part D CMS Receivables, net 299,837 58,202 Total Medicare Part D CMS Payables, net 3,619 53,280 The CMS risk sharing receivables are included in other receivables while the CMS risk sharing payables are included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities. The coverage gap, reinsurance and low-income subsidy receivables are included in other receivables while the coverage gap, reinsurance and low-income subsidy payables are included in medical liabilities. The Company has quota share arrangements on business with certain individual and employer groups with some of its Medicare distribution partners covering portions of the Companys Medicare Part D and, previously, Medicare PFFS products.The Medicare PFFS products were not renewed for the 2010 plan year and, accordingly, the quota share arrangements were discontinued with a two year run out provision.As a result of the quota share arrangements, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company ceded premium revenue of $433 million, $498 million and $4165 million, respectively, and the associated medical costs to these partners.The ceded amounts are excluded from the Companys results of operations. The Company is not relieved of its primary obligation to the policyholder under this ceding arrangement.  63 Table of Contents Management services revenue is generally a fixed administrative fee, provided on a predetermined contractual basis or on a percentage-of-savings basis, for access to the Companys health care provider networks and health care management services, for which it does not assume underwriting risk. Percentage of savings revenue is determined using the difference between charges billed by contracted medical providers and the contracted reimbursement rates for the services billed and is recognized based on claims processed. The management services the Company provides typically include health care provider network access, clinical management, pharmacy benefit management, bill review, claims repricing, claims processing, utilization review and quality assurance. Revenue for pharmacy benefit management services for the Workers' Compensation business is derived on a pre-negotiated amount per pharmacy claim which includes the cost of the pharmaceutical.Revenue and a corresponding cost of sales to a third-party vendor related to the sale of pharmaceuticals is recorded when a pharmacy transaction is processed by the Company.No pharmacy rebate revenue is collected or recorded related to the Companys Workers Compensation business. Based on information received subsequent to premium billings being sent, historical trends, bad debt write-offs and the collectibility of specific accounts, the Company estimates, on a monthly basis, the amount of bad debt and future retroactivity and adjusts its revenue and reserves accordingly. Premiums for services to federal employee groups are subject to audit and review by the OPM on a periodic basis. Such audits are usually a number of years in arrears. The Company estimates and records reserves for audit and other contract adjustments for both its managed care contracts and experience rated plans based on appropriate guidelines and historical results.Adjustments are recorded as additional information regarding the audits and reviews becomes available. Any differences between actual results and estimates are recorded in the period the audits are finalized. CMS periodically performs audits and may seek return of premium payments made to the company if risk adjustment factors are not properly supported by medical record data. The Company estimates and records reserves for CMS audits based on information available at the time the estimates are made. The judgements and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies include, among other things, significant estimates related to the amount of hierarchical condition category HCC revenue subject to audit, anticipated error rates, sample methodologies, confidence intervals, enrollee selection, and payment error extrapolation methodology. The Company has recorded risk adjustment data validation RADV reserves, for contract years 2007 through 2011, of $1552 million at December 31, 2011.The total RADV liability includes $1256 million associated with the 2007 through 2010 contract years. Although the Company maintains reserves for RADV audits, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Effective in 2011, as required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 collectively, PPACA, commercial health plans with medical loss ratios MLR on fully insured products that fall below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. The mandatedminimum MLR targets as calculated under the definitions in PPACA and related regulations, for health plans such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on health care medical costs and quality improvement expenses, are set at 85% for large employer groups, 80% for small employer groups and 80% for individuals, subject to state-specific exceptions.The potential for and size of the rebates are measured by regulated subsidiary, state and market segment individual, small group and large group.Accordingly, in the current year, the Company has recorded a rebate estimate in the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities line in the accompanying balance sheet and as contra-revenue in managed care premiums in the accompanying statements of operations.The Company estimates the rebate liability based on judgments and estimated information, including utilization, unit cost trends, quality improvement costs, and product pricing, features and benefits.If actual experience varies from the Companys estimates or future regulatory guidance differs from its current judgments, the actual rebate liability could differ from the Companys estimates. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of the expense for prescription drugs provided by the Companys Workers Compensation pharmacy benefit manager and for the independent medical examinations performed by physicians on injured workers.These costs are associated with fee-based products and exclude the cost of drugs related to the risk products recorded in medical costs. Contract Acquisition Costs Costs related to the acquisition of customer contracts, such as commissions paid to outside brokers, are paid on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred.For the Medicare Advantage Coordinated Care Plans Medicare Advantage CCP business, the Company advances commissions and defers amortization of these costs to the period in which revenue associated with the acquired customer is earned, which is generally not more than one year. Income Taxes The Company files a consolidated federal tax return for the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.Taxable income includes the effect of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities.Valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more-likely-than-not to be ultimately realized.  64 Table of Contents Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of all options and the vesting of all restricted stock using the treasury stock method. Potential common stock equivalents to purchase 65 million, 103 million and 122 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the potential common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive. Other Income, net Other income, net includes interest income, net of fees, gains on the repayment of debt, realized gains and losses on sales of investments and charges on the other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities. New Accounting Standards In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement Topic 820: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. ASU 2011-04 requires additional fair value measurement disclosures, including: a quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for Level 3 fair value measurements, a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs, and a description of a companys valuation process, b any transfers between Level 1 and 2, c information about when the current use of a non-financial asset measured at fair value differs from its highest and best use, and d the hierarchy classification for items whose fair value is not recorded on the balance sheet but is disclosed in the notes. ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company will adopt the disclosure requirements beginning in fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-04 is not expected to materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June and December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Presentation of Comprehensive Income and ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in ASU 2011-05, respectively.ASU 2011-05 allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Also, ASU 2011-05 requires that reclassification adjustments between comprehensive income and net income must be presented on the face of the financial statements. ASU 2011-12 defers until further notice the requirement that reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. Both ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.The Company will adopt the disclosure requirements beginning in fiscal year 2012. The adoptions of ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 are not expected to affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. In July 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-06, Other Expenses Topic 720: Fees Paid to the Federal Government by Health Insurers. ASU 2011-06 addresses the timing, recognition and classification of the annual health insurance industry assessment fee imposed on health insurers by the PPACA. The mandatory annual fee of health insurers will be imposed for each calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2014. This update requires that the liability for the fee be estimated and recorded in full once the entity provides qualifying health insurance in the applicable calendar year in which the fee is payable with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight-line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable.Although the federally mandated annual fee may be material, the adoption of ASU 2011-06 only affects the timing of the expense recognition within the Companys financial position and results of operations. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for Impairment. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted.The Company will adopt ASU 2011-08 beginning in fiscal year 2012. The adoption of ASU 2011-08 is not expected to materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. B.

ACQUISITIONS During the three years ended December 31, 2011, the Company completed two business combinations. These business combinations were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and therefore the operating results of each acquisition have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements since the date of their acquisition. The purchase price for each business combination was allocated to the assets, including the identifiable intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The following table summarizes the business combinations for the year ended December 31, 2010.The purchase price, inclusive of all retroactive balance sheet settlements to date, is presented below in millions 
Effective Date Market Price  Preferred Health Systems, Inc. PHS February 1, 2010 Kansas 945

D. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On July 31, 2009, the Company completed the sale of its fee-based Medicaid services subsidiary FHSC for $1175 million in cash, which included adjustments for changes in working capital. FHSC was a component of the Companys business operations within its Specialized Managed Care operating segment. In accordance with ASC Topic 205-20, Discontinued Operations, FHSCs operations and disposal costs are presented as a loss from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Companys consolidated statements of operations. The following table presents select FHSC discontinued operations information in thousands  Year ended

Accordingly, the Company performed an estimate of the probable impairment loss, determined that the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit was impaired, and recorded a gross impairment charge of $724 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2009. E. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill, by reporting segment, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows in thousands  Health Plan and 
Medical Services Specialized Managed 
Care Workers Compensation Total  Balance, December 31, 2009 1,463,574 259,068 806,642 2,529,284 Acquisition of PHS 16,987 16,987 Acquisition of MHP 4,920 4,920 Other adjustments 621 621 Balance, December 31, 2010 1,485,481 258,447 806,642 2,550,570 Acquisition of PHS 4,164 4,164 Acquisition of MHP 4,871 4,871 Deferred tax adjustments 10,771 10,771 Balance, December 31, 2011 1,483,745 258,447 806,642 2,548,834 The Company completed its 2011 annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with ASC Topic 350 and determined that there were no impairments.In performing its impairment analysis the Company identified its reporting units in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 350 and ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, acquired assets and assumed liabilities were assigned to a reporting unit as of the acquisition date if both of the following criteria were met: 1 the asset will be employed in or the liability relates to the operations of a reporting unit and 2 the asset or liability will be considered in determining the fair value of the reporting unit.Corporate assets or liabilities were also assigned to a reporting unit if both of these criteria were met. In order to determine the fair value of its reporting units, the Company weighted the income approach and the market approach.Under the income approach, the Company assumed certain growth rates, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates in its calculations. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Companys reporting units included terminal values based upon long term growth rates and a discount rate based on the Companys weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations. The market approach estimates the Companys fair value by utilizing market multiples. As an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the reporting units, the Company compared the aggregate fair values of its reporting units to its market capitalization.The comparison confirmed that the determined fair values were representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium.The Company determined that its implied control premium was reasonable based on a review of such premiums identified in recent acquisitions for entities of similar size and/or in similar industries. The Company will continue to monitor its market capitalization in relation to aggregate fair values of its reporting units to determine if events and circumstances warrant the performance of an interim impairment analysis.  69 Table of Contents Other Intangible Assets The other intangible asset balances are as follows in thousands  Gross Net  Carrying Accumulated Carrying Amortization  Amount Amortization Amount Period As of December 31, 2011 Amortized other intangible assets Customer Lists 579,062 344,111 234,951 7-15 Years HMO Licenses 12,600 8,312 4,288 20 Years Provider Networks 63,200 20,895 42,305 15-20 Years Trade Name 3,449 3,360 89 3-4 Years Total amortized other intangible assets 658,311 376,678 281,633  Unamortized other intangible assets Trade Name 85,900 85,900 Total unamortized other intangible assets 85,900 85,900 Total other intangible assets 744,211 376,678 367,533  As of December 31, 2010 Amortized other intangible assets Customer Lists 579,062 283,978 295,084 7-15 Years HMO Licenses 12,600 7,717 4,883 20 Years Provider Networks 63,200 17,605 45,595 15-20 Years Trade Names 3,449 3,025 424 3-4 Years Total amortized other intangible assets 658,311 312,325 345,986  Unamortized other intangible assets Trade Name 85,900 85,900 Total unamortized other intangible assets 85,900 85,900 Total other intangible assets 744,211 312,325 431,886 The Company performed an impairment test of its unamortized other intangible asset trade name as of October 1, 2011, and determined that the asset was not impaired.

Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is a continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and that other-than-temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods. H.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Financial Assets ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value and requires a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value based on the quality and reliability of the inputs or assumptions used in fair value measurements. The Company obtains one price for each security from an independent third-party valuation service provider, which uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value as noted above.As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, the Company performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the third-party provider to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. The Companys Level 1 securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities and cash. The Company determines the estimated fair value for its Level 1 securities using quoted unadjusted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. The Companys Level 2 securities primarily consist of government-sponsored enterprise securities, state and municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and money market funds. The Company determines the estimated fair value for its Level 2 securities using the following methods: quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets few transactions, limited information, non-current prices and high variability over time, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset/liability e.g. interest rates, yield curves volatilities and default rates, among others, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data. For the Companys Level 2 assets, the following inputs and valuation techniques were utilized in determining the fair value of its financial instruments Cash Equivalents:Level 2 cash equivalents are valued using inputs that are principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data, primarily quoted prices for like or similar assets. Government-Sponsored Enterprises:These securities primarily consist of bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.The fair value of government-sponsored enterprises is based upon observable market inputs such as quoted prices for like or similar assets, benchmark yields, reported trades and credit spreads. State and Municipal Bonds, Corporate Debt and Other Securities:The fair value of the Companys debt securities is determined by observable market inputs which include quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are traded in an active market, benchmark yields, new issuances, issuer ratings, reported trades of comparable securities and credit spreads. Residential and Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Asset-Backed Securities:The fair value of these securities is determined either by observable market inputs, which include quoted prices for identical or similar assets that are traded in an active market, or by a cash flow model which utilizes the following inputs:benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance, credit spreads and default rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. The Companys Level 3 securities primarily consisted of corporate financial holdings and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities that were thinly traded due to market volatility and lack of liquidity.The Company determined the estimated fair value for its Level 3 securities using unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data including, but not limited to, broker quotes, default rates, benchmark yields, credit spreads and prepayment speeds.  73 Table of Contents The following table presents the fair value hierarchy for the Companys financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2011 and 2010 in thousands  Quoted Prices in

Financial Liabilities The Company fair value of publicly-traded debt senior notes is based on quoted market prices for the identical or a similar liability when traded as an asset in an active market.The carrying value of the senior notes including the long-term and current portions was $182 billion at December 31, 2011 and $122 billion at December 31, 2010.The estimated fair value of the Companys senior notes including the long-term and current portions was $199 billion at December 31, 2011 and $127 billion at December 31, 2010. The carrying value of the revolving credit facility approximated the fair value due to the short maturity dates of the draws.The Company had no outstanding borrowings under its current credit facility at December 31, 2011. I. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has one stock incentive plan, the Amended and Restated 2004 Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan under which shares of the Companys common stock are authorized for issuance to key employees, consultants and directors in the form of stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Shares available for issuance under the Incentive Plan were 43 million as of December 31, 2011.  75 Table of Contents Stock Options Under the Incentive Plan, the terms and conditions of option grants are established on an individual basis with the exercise price of the options being equal to but not less than the fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Options generally become exercisable after one year in either 33% or 25% increments per year and expire ten years from the date of grant. The Company continues to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model and amortizes compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant. The methodology used in 2011 to derive the assumptions used in the valuation model is consistent with that used in prior years. The following average values and weighted-average assumptions were used for option grants.  2011 2010 2009  Black-Scholes-Merton Value 1108 745 711 Dividend yield 00 00 00 Risk-free interest rate 09 14 17 Expected volatility 419 474 608 Expected life in years 35 35 38 The Company has not paid dividends in the past nor does it expect to pay dividends in the future. As such, the Company used a dividend yield percentage of zero. The Company uses a risk-free interest rate consistent with the yield available on a U.S. Treasury note with a term equal to the expected term of the underlying grants. The expected volatility was estimated based upon a blend of the implied volatility of the Companys tradeable options and the historical volatility of the Companys share price. The expected life was estimated based upon exercise experience of option grants made in the past to Company employees. The Company recorded compensation expense related to stock options of approximately $156 million, $210 million and $306 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Cash received from stock option exercises was $446 million, $155 million and $12 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $209 million, $113 million, and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.The tax benefit realized from stock option exercises was $77 million, $41 million and $05 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, there was $200 million of total unrecognized compensation cost net of expected forfeitures related to nonvested stock option grants which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 20 years.

During 2009, the Company repaid a total of $689 million principal of outstanding senior notes for payments of $599 million, resulting in a gain of $84 million.These gains were net of the write off of deferred financing costs.The funds for the repayments were provided by cash from operations.During 2009, the Company repaid $2350 million on its revolving credit facility. The Companys senior notes and Credit Facility contain certain covenants and restrictions regarding, among other things, liens, asset dispositions and consolidations or mergers.Additionally, the Companys Credit Facility requires compliance with a leverage ratio of 3 to 1 and limits subsidiary debt.As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with the applicable covenants and restrictions under its senior notes and Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, the aggregate maturities of debt based on their contractual terms, gross of unamortized discount, were as follows in thousands Year Amount 2012  233,903 2013  2014 375,097 2015 228,845 2016 Thereafter 983,235 Total 1,821,080 M.

Total rent expense was $333 million, $324 million and $356 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  81 Table of Contents Legal Proceedings In the normal course of business, the Company has been named as a defendant in various legal actions such as actions seeking payments for claims denied by the Company, medical malpractice actions, employment related claims and other various claims seeking monetary damages. The claims are in various stages of proceedings and some may ultimately be brought to trial. Incidents occurring through December 31, 2011 may result in the assertion of additional claims. The Company maintains general liability, professional liability and employment practices liability insurances in amounts that it believes are appropriate, with varying deductibles for which it maintains reserves. The professional errors and omissions liability and employment practices liability insurances are carried through its captive subsidiary. Although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain, the Company does not believe the results of such actions currently threatened or pending, including those described below, will individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. On February 25, 2008, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, Northern Division, requesting information regarding the operational process for confirming Medicare eligibility for its Workers Compensation set-aside product. The Company is fully cooperating and is providing the requested information. The Company cannot predict what, if any, actions may be taken by the U.S. Attorney. However, based on the information known to date, the Company does not believe that the outcome of this investigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. FHGC, a subsidiary of the Company, was a party to various lawsuits filed in the state and federal courts of Louisiana involving disputes between providers and workers compensation payors who access FHGCs contracts with these providers to reimburse them for services rendered to injured workers. FHGC has written contracts with providers in Louisiana which expressly state that the provider agrees to accept a specified discount off their billed charges for services rendered to injured workers. The discounted rate set forth in the FHGC provider contract is less than the reimbursement amount set forth in the Louisiana Workers Compensation Fee Schedule. For this reason, workers compensation insurers and third-party administrators TPAs for employers who self-insure workers compensation benefits contract with FHGC to access the FHGC provider contracts. Thus, when a FHGC contracted provider renders services to an injured worker, the workers compensation insurer or the TPA reimburses the provider for those services in accordance with the discounted rate in the providers contract with FHGC. These workers compensation insurers and TPAs are referred to as payors in the FHGC provider contract and the contract expressly states that the discounted rate will apply to those payors who access the FHGC contract. Thus, the providers enter into these contracts with FHGC knowing that they will be paid the discounted rate by every payor who chooses to access the FHGC contract. Four providers who have contracts with FHGC filed a state court class action lawsuit against FHGC and certain payors alleging that FHGC violated Louisianas Any Willing Provider Act the Act, which requires a payor accessing a preferred provider network contract to give a one-time notice 30 days before that payor uses the discounted rate in the preferred provider network contract to pay the provider for services rendered to a member insured under that payors health benefit plan. These provider plaintiffs alleged that the Act applies to medical bills for treatment rendered to injured workers and that the Act requires point of service written notice in the form of a benefit identification card. If a payor is found to have violated the Acts notice provision, the court may assess up to $2,000 in damages for each instance when the provider was not given proper notice that a discounted rate would be used to pay for the services rendered. The provider plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment against FHGC seeking damages of $2,000 for each provider visit where the provider was not given a benefit identification card at the time the service was performed. The state court granted the plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment in the amount of $262 million. FHGC appealed both the partial summary judgment order and the courts prior order denying the motion by FHGC to decertify the class to the states intermediate appellate court. Both appeals were denied by the intermediate appellate court. As a result of the Louisiana appellate courts decision on July 1, 2010 to affirm the state trial courts summary judgment order, the Company recorded a $278 million pre-tax charge to earnings and a corresponding accrued liability during the quarter ended June 30, 2010.This amount represented the $262 million judgment amount plus post judgment interest and is included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2010.The Company accrued for legal fees expected to be incurred related to this case as well as post judgment interest subsequent to the second quarter charge, which were included in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet at December 31, 2010.  82 Table of Contents On February 2, 2011, FHGC, counsel for the class representatives and the class representatives executed a definitive settlement agreement which was acceptable to FHGC. FHGC would pay $1505 million to satisfy in full the amount of the partial summary judgment and to resolve and settle all claims of the class, including claims for pre- and post- judgment interest, attorneys fees and costs.In addition, Coventry would assign to the class certain rights it has to the proceeds of FHGCs insurance policies relating to the claims asserted by the class. In exchange for the settlement payment by FHGC, class members would release FHGC and all of its affiliates and clients for any claims relating in any way to re-pricing, payment for, or reimbursement of a workers compensation bill, including but not limited to claims under the Act. Plaintiffs also agreed to a notice procedure that FHGC may follow in the future to comply with the Act. Accordingly, the Company made a $1505 million cash payment into escrow.On May 27, 2011, the court entered an order of final approval of the settlement and thus all contingencies in the definitive settlement agreement were satisfied.As a result of the resolution of the settlement agreement contingencies, including final court approval, the Company recorded a non-recurring pre-tax adjustment to earnings of $1593 million, or $068 per diluted share after tax, in the second quarter of 2011. The $1505 million escrow amount was released to the Settlement Administrator for the class action plaintiffs on the settlement effective date of August 9, 2011. On September 3, 2009, a shareholder filed a putative securities class action against the Company and three of its current and former officers in the federal district court of Maryland. Subsequent to the filing of the complaint, three other shareholders and/or investor groups filed motions with the court for appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of selection of lead and liaison counsel. By agreement, the four shareholders submitted a stipulation to the court regarding appointment of lead plaintiff and approval of selection of lead and liaison counsel. In December 2009, the court approved the stipulation and ordered the lead plaintiff to file a consolidated and amended complaint. The purported class period is February 9, 2007 to October 22, 2008. The consolidated and amended complaint alleges that the Companys public statements contained false, misleading and incomplete information regarding the Companys profitability, particularly the profit margins for its Medicare PFFS products.The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. By Order, dated March 31, 2011, the court granted in part, and denied in part, the Companys motion to dismiss the complaint.The Company has filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to that part of the courts March 31, 2011 Order which denied the Companys motion to dismiss the complaint. The motion for reconsideration was denied but the court did rule that the class period was further restricted to April 25, 2008 to June 18, 2008.The Company will vigorously defend against the allegations in the lawsuit.Although it cannot predict the outcome, the Company believes this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. On October 13, 2009, two former employees and participants in the Coventry Health Care Retirement Savings Plan filed a putative ERISA class action lawsuit against the Company and several of its current and former officers, directors and employees in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. Plaintiffs allege that defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA by offering and maintaining Company stock in the Plan after it allegedly became imprudent to do so and by allegedly failing to provide complete and accurate information about the Companys financial condition to plan participants in SEC filings and public statements. Three similar actions by different plaintiffs were later filed in the same court and were consolidated on December 9, 2009. An amended consolidated complaint has been filed.The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. By Order, dated March 31, 2011, the court denied the Companys motion to dismiss the amended complaint.The Company filed a motion for reconsideration of the courts March 31, 2011 Order and filed an Alternative Motion to Certify the Courts March 31, 2011 Order For Interlocutory Appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both of those motions were denied. The Company will vigorously defend against the allegations in the consolidated lawsuit.Although it cannot predict the outcome, the Company believes this lawsuit will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. Guaranty Fund Assessments The Company operates in a regulatory environment that may require the Company to participate in assessments under state insurance guaranty association laws. The Companys exposure to guaranty fund assessments is based on its share of business it writes in the relevant jurisdictions for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner has placed Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary collectively, Penn Treaty, neither of which is affiliated with the Company, in rehabilitation an intermediate action before insolvency and has petitioned a Pennsylvania state court for liquidation. If Penn Treaty is liquidated, the Companys health plans and other insurers may be required to pay a portion of Penn Treatys policyholder claims through guaranty association assessments in future periods from various states in which Penn Treaty policyholders reside and in which the Companys health plans and insurance subsidiaries write premiums. The Company is unable to estimate losses or ranges of losses because the Company cannot predict when the Pennsylvania state court will render a decision, the amount of the insolvency, if any, the amount and timing of any associated guaranty fund assessments or the availability and amount of any potential offsets, such as an offset of any premium taxes otherwise payable by the Company. Based on information known to date, the Company cannot predict the outcome of this matter.However, an assessment could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.  83 Table of Contents Capitation Arrangements The Company has capitation arrangements for certain ancillary health care services, such as laboratory services and, in some cases, physician and radiology services. A small percentage of the Companys membership is covered by global capitation arrangements. Under the typical arrangement, the provider receives a fixed percentage of premiums to cover costs of all medical care or of the specified ancillary services provided to the capitated members. Under some capitated and professional capitation arrangements, physicians may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements. Capitation arrangements limit the Companys exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose the Company to risk as to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider organization. The Company is ultimately responsible for the coverage of its members pursuant to the customer agreements. To the extent that a provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangements, the Company will be required to perform such obligations. Consequently, the Company may have to incur costs in excess of the amounts it would otherwise have to pay under the original global or ancillary capitation through contracted network arrangements. Medical costs associated with capitation arrangements made up approximately 82%, 64% and 29% of the Companys total medical costs for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. N. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK The Companys financial instruments that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investments in fixed income securities and accounts receivable. The Company invests its excess cash in state and municipal bonds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt and other securities. Investments in marketable securities are managed within guidelines established by the Board of Directors, which only allow for the purchase of investment-grade fixed income securities and limits exposure to any one issuer. The fair value of the Companys financial instruments is equivalent to their carrying value. There is some credit risk associated with these instruments. The Company is a provider of health insurance coverage to the State of Illinois employees and their dependents.In August 2009, the State of Illinois notified the Company of the States significant budget deficit and subsequently the State has limited payments to the Company based on available cash. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has an outstanding premium receivable balance from the State of Illinois of approximately $499 million which represents seven months of health insurance premiums.As the receivable is from a governmental entity which has been making payments, the Company believes that the full receivable balance will ultimately be realized and therefore the Company has not reserved against the outstanding balance.The Companys regulated subsidiaries are required to submit statutory-basis financial statements to state regulatory agencies.For those financial statements, in accordance with state regulations, this receivable is being treated as an admitted asset in its entirety. Concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their breakdown among geographical locations. The Company believes the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for estimated losses as of December 31, 2011. The Company has a risk of incurring losses if such allowances are not adequate. The Company contracts with a pharmacy benefit management PBM vendor to manage the pharmacy benefits for its members and to provide rebate administration services on behalf of the Company.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had pharmacy rebate receivables of $2805 million due from the PBM vendor resulting from the normal cycle of rebate processing, data submission and collection of rebates.The Company has credit risk due to the concentration of receivables with this single vendor although the Company does not consider the associated credit risk to be significant.The Company only records the pharmacy rebate receivables to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of collection.  84 Table of Contents O. STATUTORY INFORMATION The Companys regulated health maintenance organizations HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are required by state regulatory agencies to maintain minimum surplus balances, thereby limiting the dividends the parent may receive from its regulated entities. During 2011, the Company received $4894 million in dividends from its regulated subsidiaries and paid $1220 million in capital contributions to these subsidiaries. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC has proposed that states adopt risk-based capital RBC standards which are a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a managed care organization to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The managed care organizations RBC is calculated by applying factors to various assets, premiums and reserve items. The factor is higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items. The adequacy of a managed care organizations actual capital can then be measured by a comparison to its RBC as determined by the formula. The Companys health plans are required to submit an RBC report to the NAIC and their domiciled states department of insurance with their annual filing. Regulators will use the RBC results to determine if any regulatory actions are required. Regulatory actions that could take place, if any, range from filing a financial action plan explaining how the plan will increase its statutory net worth to the approved levels, to the health plan being placed under regulatory control. The majority of states in which the Company operates health plans have adopted a RBC policy that recommends the health plans maintain statutory reserves at or above the Company Action Level, which is currently equal to 200% of their RBC.Some states in which the Companys regulated subsidiaries operate require deposits to be maintained with the respective states departments of insurance. The table below summarizes the Companys statutory reserve information as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 in millions, except percentage data.  2011 2010  unaudited Regulated capital and surplus 1,9031 1,9024 200% of RBC 1 6979 6715 Excess capital and surplus above 200% of RBC 1 1,2052 1,2309 Capital and surplus as percentage of RBC 1 545 567 Statutory deposits 740 799 1 RBC amounts are not audited. The decrease in capital and surplus for the Companys regulated subsidiaries primarily resulted from dividends paid to the parent company partially offset by net earnings and capital contributions made by the parent company. The Company believes that all subsidiaries which incur medical claims maintain more than adequate liquidity and capital resources to meet these short-term obligations as a matter of both Company policy and applicable department of insurance regulations. Excluding funds held by entities subject to regulation and excluding the equity method investments, the Company had cash and investments of approximately $14 billion and $11 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.The increase primarily resulted from the issuance of the 2021 Notes discussed previously, dividends received from the Companys regulated subsidiaries, and earnings generated from its non-regulated entities.This increase was partially offset by share repurchases, repayment of debt related to our revolving credit facility, a cash payment related to the provider class action litigation in Louisiana and capital contributions made by the parent. P. OTHER INCOME, NET Other income, net includes interest income, net of fees, of approximately $694 million, $708 million and $655 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other income, net included a gain on disposal of investments of $170 million, $110 million and $116 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Other income, net includes gains of $84 million on the repayment of outstanding debt for the year ended December 31, 2009.As discussed in Note G, Investments, to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to the Companys equity method investments of $50 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  85 Table of Contents Q. SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM The Companys Board of Directors has approved a program to repurchase its outstanding common shares.Share repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices on the open market, by block purchase, or in private transactions. The Companys Board of Directors approved increases in November 2011 and March 2011 to the share repurchase program in amounts equal to 10% and 5% of the Companys then outstanding common stock, thus increasing the Companys repurchase authorization by 144 million and 75 million shares, respectively. Under the share repurchase program, the Company purchased 107 million shares and 15 million shares of its common stock, at an aggregate cost of $3277 million and $300 million during 2011 and 2009, respectively.During 2010, the Company made no repurchases of its common stock. As of December 31, 2011, the total remaining common shares the Company is authorized to repurchase under this program is 165 million. Excluded from these amounts are shares purchased in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards to satisfy employees minimum statutory tax withholding obligations as these purchases are not part of the program. R. QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED The following is a summary of unaudited quarterly results of operations in thousands, except per share data for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.Due to rounding of quarterly results, total amounts for each year may differ immaterially from the annual results.

See Note M, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. 2 As a result of the Louisiana appellate courts decision on July 1, 2010 to affirm the state trial courts summary judgment order, the Company recorded a $278 million pre-tax charge to earnings and a corresponding accrued liability during the quarter ended June 30, 2010.  86 Table of Contents S. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION Allen F. Wise, Chief Executive Officer and Chairmanof the Company, held a beneficial interest in Health Risk Partners HRP, an organization that entered into a written contract with the Company to provide claims analysis services relating to the Companys Medicare line of business. Additionally, Mr. Wises son owned a minority interest in HRP and served as an executive officer.The contract was negotiated and entered into on an arms-length basis, and consistent with the Companys Related Person Transaction policy, disinterested members of the Board of Directors and the Boards Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considered the transaction and determined that the services provided would be beneficial to the Company and that the amounts paid were immaterial to the Company and that the terms of the contract with HRP were fair and competitive with market rates for such services.Two other Directors of the Company owned minority interests in HRP.In June 2011, HRP was acquired by a third-party, which assumed the contract with the Company and is not a related party.Except for post-closing purchase price adjustments, Mr. Wise, his son and the two Directors have ceased to have any direct or indirect interest in HRPs contract with the Company.For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company paid approximately $154 million and $122 million, respectively, to HRP for services rendered under the contract.During the period in 2011 in which Mr. Wise held a beneficial interest, the Company paid approximately $27 million to HRP for services rendered under the contract. At December 31, 2010, the Company had accrued amounts to HRP of approximately $18 million, recognized within accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Mr. Daniel N. Mendelson, a director of the Company, is the Chief Executive Officer and majority owner of Avalere Health Inc. Avalere Health LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avalere Health Inc., is a healthcare policy and strategic advisory firm that provides syndicated research and market information products for clients in the healthcare industry, government and the not-for-profit sector. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the amount the Company paid to Avalere Health LLC for these services was $02 million, $02 million and $01 million. Consistent with the Companys Related Person Transactions Policy, disinterested members of the Board considered the transaction and determined that the services provided would be beneficial to the Company and the amounts to be paid were immaterial to both Avalere Health, Inc. and the Company and that the terms of the contract with Avalere Health, Inc. are fair and competitive with market rates for such services. Mr. Joseph R. Swedish, a director of the Company since 2010, is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Trinity Health, a not-for-profit, integrated health care delivery system which operates 47 hospitals and other health care facilities in eight states. Trinity Health has entered into market based provider contracts with subsidiaries of the Company in these eight states. During 2011 and 2010, the Company paid approximately $144 million and $189 million respectively to Trinity Health for health care services provided to its members. Consistent with the Companys Related Person Transactions Policy, disinterested members of the Boards Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee as well as disinterested members of the entire Board determined that the level of reimbursement paid to Trinity Health for services provided to its members were market based and that the total amount paid was immaterial to both Trinity Health and the Company. Since Trinity Health is a not-for-profit organization, Mr. Swedish derives no additional income as a result of the transaction between Trinity Health and the Company. T. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On January 1, 2012 the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Childrens Mercys Family Health Partners, a Medicaid health plan that was affiliated with Childrens Mercy Hospital in Kansas City.With this acquisition of Childrens Mercys Family Health Partners, Coventry has added approximately 210,000 Medicaid members, with approximately 155,000 members in the State of Kansas and 55,000 members in the State of Missouri.This acquisition is not material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In January 2012, at maturity, the Company repaid the $2339 million outstanding balance of its 5875% Senior Notes.See Note L, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. On February 24, 2012, CMS released a Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation Methodology for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Validation RADV Contract-Level Audits. Most importantly, CMS has made significant changes regarding which contract years will be subject to the CMS RADV audits. The Company maintains reserves for its exposure to the RADV audits, and it is anticipated that the changes made by CMS will result in a reduction of the Companys reserves in the first quarter of 2012, which could have a material favorable effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations.  87 Table of Contents Item 1 Business 4

Item 5: Controls and Procedures Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Coventrys management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.Internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Companys receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Coventrys management has performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 based on criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, Internal Controls Integrated Framework, and believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for such an evaluation.Management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, and their opinion is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We have performed an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Changes to certain processes, information technology systems and other components of internal control over financial reporting resulting from the acquisitions may occur and will be evaluated by management as such integration activities are implemented.  88 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Coventry Health Care, Inc. We have audited Coventry Health Care, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Controls Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Coventry Health Care, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Coventry Health Care, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Coventry Health Care, Inc.s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Coventry Health Care, Inc., and our report dated February 27, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP Baltimore, Maryland
