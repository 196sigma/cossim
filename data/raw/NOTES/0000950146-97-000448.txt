To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Covance Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the
related consolidated statements of income, of cash flows and of stockholders'
equity appearing on pages 40 through 56 present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Covance Inc. and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above. s/ Price Waterhouse LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 1. Organization and Spin-off
Organization
Covance Inc. and its subsidiaries Covance is a leading contract
research organization providing a wide range of integrated product development
services on a worldwide basis to the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical
device industries. Also, Covance provides services such as health economics for
managed care organizations, hospitals and health care provider networks, and
early development and laboratory testing services to the chemical, agrochemical
and food industries. Covance operations involve a single industry segment for
financial reporting purposes. At the present time, operations are principally
focused in the United States and Europe.
Spin-off
Prior to December 31, 1996, Covance was an indirect wholly-owned business
of Corning Incorporated Corning. In May 1996, Corning Board of Directors
approved a plan to distribute to its stockholders on a pro rata basis all of its
ownership interest in Covance the Spin-Off Distribution. The intent of the
plan was to create an independent, publicly-owned company Covance. In June
1996, Corning submitted to the Internal Revenue Service IRS a request for a
ruling that the Spin-Off Distribution qualify as a tax free distribution under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In November 1996, the IRS
approved that request. In November 1996, Corning Board of Directors approved
the final terms of the Spin-Off Distribution, and effective December 31, 1996
the Spin-Off Distribution was complete. Under the terms of the Spin-Off
distribution, shareholder of record of Corning common stock on December 31,
1996 received one share of Covance common stock for each four shares of Corning
common stock held. As a result of the Spin-Off Distribution, Covance issued
approximately 562 million shares of its common stock.
In connection with the Spin-Off distribution, Covance recorded a one-time
charge totaling $274 million $197 million net of tax, consisting of the cost
of establishing and funding two employee stock ownership plans collectively,
the ESOP and the direct costs incurred to effect the Spin-Off distribution.
The ESOP component of the charge, which totaled $167 million, represents the
fair market value of the shares approximately 855,000 issued into the ESOP.
The direct costs consist primarily of accounting, legal and other professional
fees associated with Covance being established as a separate publicly traded
entity. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities
controlled by Covance, including Covance Biotechnology, a majority owned
business. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.
The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates in which
Covance owns between 20 and 50 percent.                                        44              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated    Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Foreign Currencies
For subsidiaries outside of the United States that operate in a local
currency environment, assets and liabilities are translated to United States
dollars at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense items are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments
are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Transaction
gains and losses are included in the determination of income.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist
principally of amounts temporarily invested in money market funds.
Financial Instruments
The fair value of cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and
accrued expenses are not materially different than their carrying amounts as
reported at December 31, 1996 and 1995.
Accounts receivable and unbilled services from Covance customers are
concentrated primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.
Covance monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit
terms in the ordinary course of business. Although Covance customers are
concentrated primarily within these two industries, management considers the
likelihood of material credit risk exposure as remote. Covance in some cases
requires advance payment for a portion of the contract price from its customers
upon the signing of a contract for services. Historically, bad debts have been
minimal.
Inventory
Inventories, which consist principally of supplies, are valued at the
lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are provided on the straight line method at rates adequate to allocate the cost
of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which range in term
from three to thirty years.                                        45              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated    Goodwill
Goodwill investment costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible
assets acquired is capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the
period expected to be benefited, which ranges from twenty to forty years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
SFAS No. 121, was adopted in 1995. Assessments of the recoverability of
long-lived assets are conducted when events or changes in circumstances occur
that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The
assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the asset
from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of related operations. The
policy on impairment prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 121 was not materially
different.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized using the cost-to-cost type of
percentage-of-completion method of accounting for services rendered in
connection with contractual arrangements, which generally range from a few
months to two years. Revenue is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of
the relationship between costs incurred and total estimated costs. Contracts may
contain provisions for renegotiation in the event of cost overruns due to
changes in the level of work scope. Renegotiated amounts are included in revenue
when earned and realization is assured. Provisions for losses to be incurred on
contracts are recognized in full in the period in which it is determined that a
loss will result from performance of the contractual arrangement. Most service
contracts may be terminated for a variety of reasons by Covance customers
either immediately or upon notice. The contracts often require payments to
Covance to recover costs incurred, including costs to wind down the study and
fees earned to date, and in some cases to provide Covance with a portion of the
fees or profits that would have been earned under the contract had the contract
not been terminated early.
Revenue from performing clinical laboratory testing services is recognized
as tests are completed. Revenue from other activities is recognized as services
are performed or products are shipped.
Unbilled receivables are recorded for revenue recognized to date that is
currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms. In general,
amounts become billable upon the achievement of milestones or in accordance with
predetermined payment schedules. Unbilled receivables are billable to customers
within one year from the respective balance sheet date. Unearned revenue is
recorded for advance billings to customers for which revenue has not been
recognized at a given date.
Covance routinely subcontracts with independent physician investigators in
connection with multi-site clinical trials. Investigator fees are not reflected
in revenue or expense since such fees are granted by customers on a pass-thru
basis without risk or reward to Covance.                                        46              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated    Costs and Expenses
Cost of revenue generally includes appropriate amounts necessary to
complete the revenue earning process and encompass direct labor and related
benefit charges, other direct costs and allocable expenses including facility
charges, indirect labor and information technology costs. Selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily consist of administrative payroll and related
benefit charges, advertising and promotional expenses, administrative travel and
allocable expenses facility charges and information technology costs.
Advertising expense is recognized as incurred.
Taxes on Income
Covance uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to
reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in enacted tax rates is
recognized in income in the period when the change is effective.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares outstanding. Earnings per share has been presented for
1996 based upon the number of Covance shares issued and outstanding as a result
of the Spin-Off Distribution. Historical earnings per share has not been
presented for periods prior to 1996 because Covance status as a wholly-owned
business of Corning for such periods does not permit a determination of the
number of shares outstanding on a comparable or consistent basis. Common stock
equivalents are not included in the earnings per share computation because they
do not result in material dilution. 3. Property and Equipment

approximately $144 million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase
business combination. The goodwill resulting from this transaction aggregated
$103 million.
In March 1996, Covance acquired all of the assets and substantially all of
the liabilities of Health Technology Associates, Inc. HTA, now known as
Covance Health Economics and Outcomes Services Inc. for an initial cash payment
of approximately $149 million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase
business combination. In accordance with the terms of the asset purchase
agreement, Covance is contingently obligated to pay up to an additional $172
million in contingent purchase price if HTA achieves certain established
earnings targets for the three year period ending March 1999. The goodwill
resulting from the initial cash payment on this transaction aggregated $137
million.
In January 1995, Covance acquired National Packaging Systems, Inc. NPS,
now known as Covance Pharmaceutical Packaging Services Inc. for an initial cash
payment of $140 million in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business
combination. In October 1996, Covance paid, pursuant to the terms of the
acquisition agreement, an additional $70 million in contingent purchase price
to former NPS shareholders as NPS achieved certain established earnings targets
for the period January 1995 through September 1996. The goodwill resulting from
this transaction aggregated $161 million.
In April 1994, Covance acquired SciCor S.A. now known as Covance Central
Laboratory Services SA, a provider of laboratory testing services domiciled in
Switzerland, for total consideration of approximately $108 million in a
transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination. The goodwill
resulting from this transaction aggregated $95 million.
Results of operations for these entities have been included in the
accompanying financial statements beginning on the respective dates of
acquisition. Pro forma information for these entities has not been presented,
due to their insignificance to Covance taken as a whole.
Goodwill associated with these and prior acquisitions aggregated $533
million and $240 million, net of accumulated amortization of $52 million and
$35 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Amortization expense
aggregated $17 million, $09 million and $05 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.                                        48              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 5. Taxes on Income
Historically, Covance and its subsidiaries have operated under a tax
sharing agreement with Corning, pursuant to which they were required to compute
their provision for income taxes on a separate return basis and pay to Corning
the separate Federal income tax return liability so computed. Covance
operations through December 31, 1996 will be included in the Federal income tax
return filed by Corning.
In connection with the Spin-Off Distribution, Covance entered into a tax
indemnification agreement with Corning and a former affiliate of Corning that
prohibits Covance for a period of two years after the date of the Spin-Off
Distribution from taking certain actions that might jeopardize the favorable tax
treatment of the Spin-Off Distribution under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and will provide Corning and the former affiliate of
Corning with certain rights of indemnification against Covance. The tax
indemnification agreement will also require Covance to take such actions as
Corning and the former affiliate of Corning may request to preserve the
favorable tax treatment provided for in any rulings obtained from the Internal
Revenue Service in respect of the Spin-Off Distribution.
Covance also entered into a tax sharing agreement with Corning and a
former affiliate of Corning which allocates responsibility for federal, state
and local taxes relating to taxable periods before the Spin-Off Distribution and
provides for computing and apportioning tax liabilities and tax benefits for
such periods.
The components of income before taxes and the related provision benefit

Income taxes payable at December 31, 1996 consist primarily of liabilities
for state and international income taxes, while income taxes payable at December
31, 1995 consist of Federal income taxes payable to Corning of $170 million,
state and other income taxes payable of $16 million and international income
taxes receivable of $20 million. Covance paid income taxes of $255 million 167 million and $170 million for the years 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Covance currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign
subsidiaries to the extent they are taxable or expected to be remitted. Taxes
have not been provided on $189 million of accumulated foreign unremitted
earnings because those earnings are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It
is not practical to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable
if such accumulated earnings were remitted. Additionally, if such accumulated
earnings were remitted, certain countries impose withholding taxes that, subject
to certain limitations, are available for use as a tax credit against any
Federal income tax liability arising from such remittance.                                        50              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

6. Long-Term Debt
In connection with being established as a separate publicly traded
company, Covance negotiated a five year $250 million senior revolving credit
facility the Credit Facility with a syndicate of banks. Under the Credit
Facility, borrowings can be made in a number of different currencies until the
fifth anniversary thereof at which time all outstanding loans must be paid in
full. Under the Credit Facility, Covance has several different interest rate
options. Interest on all outstanding borrowings during 1996 was computed based
upon the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
Covance has the option to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facility
in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of breakage costs, in
certain circumstances. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants and
requires the maintenance of key ratios, as defined in the Credit Facility.
In order to repay Corning and affiliates for intercompany borrowings and
income tax liabilities, Covance borrowed $1600 million under the Credit
Facility in November 1996. For the period of time during 1996 that this
borrowing was outstanding, interest was incurred at the rate of approximately
60% per annum. 7. Employee Benefit Plans
Covance has several defined contribution plans covering substantially all
of its full-time employees. Contributions to these plans aggregated $66
million, $49 million and $42 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. 8. Stockholders' Equity
Preferred Stock
Covance is authorized to issue up to 100 million shares of Series
Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share the Covance Series Preferred
Stock. The Covance Board of Directors has the authority to issue such shares
from time to time, without stockholder approval, and to determine the
designations, preferences, rights, including voting rights, and restrictions of
such shares, subject to the Delaware General Corporate Laws. Pursuant to this
authority, the Covance Board of Directors has designated 10 million shares of
the Covance Series Preferred Stock as Covance Series A Preferred Stock. No other
class of Covance Series Preferred Stock has been designated by the Board. As of
December 31, 1996 no Covance Series Preferred Stock has been issued or is
outstanding.
Dividends - Common Stock
While owned by Corning, Covance paid to Corning dividends of $34 million 102 million and $95 million during 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. As a
separate publicly traded company, Covance Board of Directors may declare
dividends on the shares of Covance Common Stock out of legally available funds
subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding Covance Series Preferred
Stock. However, Covance has no present intention to declare dividends for the
foreseeable future, but instead intends to retain earnings to provide funds for
the operation and expansion of its business. In addition, the Credit Facility
prohibits Covance from paying cash dividends on the Covance Common Stock during
a default or event of default, as defined in the Credit Facility, or after
giving effect to the payment of such dividends Covance would not be in
compliance with the financial covenants of the Credit Facility.                                        51              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated    Stock Compensation Plans
In December 1996, Covance adopted, in connection with the Spin-Off
Distribution, the Employee Equity Participation Program EEPP. The EEPP
consists of two plans: a a stock option plan the Covance Stock Option
Plan; and b an incentive stock plan the Covance Incentive Stock Plan.
The EEPP, which is administered by the Covance Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, provides for the grant to eligible employees of either
non-qualified or incentive stock options, or both, to purchase shares of Covance
common stock at no less than fair market value on the date of grant. Options
granted are not exercisable for at least twelve months and expire no more than
ten years from date of grant. The EEPP also authorizes the Covance Compensation
Committee to award eligible employees shares, or the right to receive shares, of
Covance common stock. The shares awarded may be subject to certain restrictions
prohibiting sale or other disposition and may be subject to forfeiture, in
certain circumstances. A maximum of 60 million shares may be optioned or
granted to eligible employees under the EEPP.
Also in December 1996, Covance adopted a stock purchase plan the Covance
Stock Purchase Plan pursuant to which Covance may make available for sale to
employees shares of its common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the
market value on the first or last day of each calendar quarter. The Covance
Stock Purchase Plan, which is administered by the Covance Compensation
Committee, is intended to give Covance employees the opportunity to purchase
shares of Covance common stock through payroll deduction. A maximum of 10
million shares may be purchased by Covance Employees under the Covance Stock
Purchase Plan.
From 1990 through 1996, certain employees of Covance were granted
restricted stock awards or options, or both, to purchase shares of Corning
common stock under existing Corning stock award and option plans. In connection
with the Spin-Off Distribution, options outstanding under the Corning stock
option plans held by Covance employees and restricted share awards made to
Covance employees were replaced by substitute awards under a newly established
conversion plan the Covance Conversion Plan. The Covance Conversion Plan has
essentially all of the same characteristics as the EEPP. The replacement stock
awards have the same terms and conditions as the Corning stock awards they
replaced. The replacement stock options have the same vesting provisions, option
periods and other terms and conditions and retain the same ratio of exercise
price per share to market value per share and the same aggregate difference
between market value and exercise price as the Corning stock options they
replaced.
Covance has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and accordingly, applies Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
its plans. Had Covance elected to recognize compensation expense, in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, for the stock option awards granted under
the Corning stock option plans to Covance employees and for the stock purchased
by Covance employees under the Corning employee stock purchase program, its net
income in 1996 and 1995 would have been $108 million and $238 million,
respectively, and its earning per share in 1996 would have been $019. The fair
value of the Corning stock options used to compute the pro forma net income and
earnings per share disclosures is the estimated present value at grant date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: expected volatility of 245%; risk free interest rate of 55% to
72%; and an expected holding period of five years.                                        52              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

employee stock ownership plans collectively, the ESOP for the benefit of all
active Covance employees as of December 31, 1996. Covance contributed
approximately 855,000 shares of its common stock into the ESOP. The shares
contributed were allocated among the plan participants based upon a percentage
of each employees annual compensation. As a result of this contribution, Covance
recorded a one-time charge of $167 million, representing the fair market value
of the shares issued into the ESOP.                                        53              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated 9. Restructuring Charge
In 1995, Covance recorded a provision for restructuring charges totaling
$46 million as a result of management decision to discontinue certain
nonstrategic operations. The restructuring charge consisted of employee
termination costs of $15 million relating to approximately 90 employees, the
write-off of fixed assets of $17 million and costs of exiting leased facilities
of $14 million. During 1995 approximately 50 of the employees had been
terminated and a total of approximately $17 million had been charged against
the restructuring reserve. During 1996, the remaining 40 employees were
terminated and all other substantive activities to complete the restructuring
plan were completed. At December 31, 1996 approximately $10 million in
restructuring reserves remain relating to facility lease obligations, which are
expected to be paid during 1997. 10. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
Minimum rental commitments under noncancellable operating leases,
primarily office and laboratory facilities including the Covance Biotechnology
facility, in effect at December 31, 1996 are as follows      Year ended December 31,
$24,514
$21,434
$18,910
$16,183
$13,169
2002 and     $20,619
Operating lease rental expense aggregated $161 million, $141 million and
$110 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
In June 1995, Covance Biotechnology lessee entered into a lease
arrangement whereby a custom-designed, fully equipped facility would be
constructed for the lessee at a cost of approximately $55 million to perform
specialized research and manufacturing activities for biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies. The lessor in this arrangement is a subsidiary of one
of the largest banks in the United States. The lease arrangement contains
purchase and cancellation options for the lessee at any time during the ten year
period covered by the lease arrangement. Although the lease arrangement is
cancelable by the lessee at any time throughout the ten year period, an initial
lease term of five years, representing management estimate at the lease
inception date of the period in which occupancy of the facility is reasonably
assured, has been selected for financial reporting purposes. The initial term of
the lease commenced in December 1996, upon completion of construction of the
facility. The annual minimum lease payments total approximately $53 million.
The lease arrangement is classified as an operating lease.
A purchase price option has been established at specific dates over the
ten year period covered by the lease arrangement. Using current estimates, the
purchase price would approximate $52 million at the end of the first year and
decreases on an amortizing basis to approximately $37 million at the end of the
tenth year.                                        54              COVANCE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise indicated    The cancellation option provisions of the lease arrangement stipulate a
residual value guarantee by Covance at specific dates over the ten year period.
Sale of the facility is stipulated in the lease arrangement at such time that
the lessee exercises the cancellation option provisions. The lessee residual
value guarantee Deficiency Payment is unconditionally payable to the lessor
in the event that the lessee terminates the lease arrangement and the sale of
the facility results in receipt of sales proceeds by the lessor in an amount
less than the lessor unamortized investment in the lease arrangement. The
lessee maximum Deficiency Payment would approximate $35 million at the end of
the first year and decreases to approximately $25 million at the end of the
tenth year, assuming that the sales proceeds received by the lessor were zero. 11. Geographic Information

Historically, Covance had participated in Corning centralized treasury
and cash management processes. For domestic operations, cash received from
operations was generally transferred to Corning on a daily basis. For
international operations, excess cash was periodically transferred to Corning.
Cash disbursements for operations, acquisitions and other investments was funded
as needed from Corning. Substantially all of Covance borrowings during 1996
prior to the establishment of the Credit Facility, 1995 and 1994 were from
Corning. The blended rate on those borrowings for 1996, 1995 and 1994 was
approximately 60%.
During 1996, 1995 and 1994, certain members of Covance management
participated in various stock compensation programs sponsored by Corning
resulting in Covance recognizing compensation expense of $15 million, $04
million and $01 million, respectively.
During 1996, 1995 and 1994 Corning and affiliates provided a number of
administrative functions to Covance which resulted in charges of $34 million 53 million and $57 million being recorded in Covance results of operations
for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Management believes the method used to
allocate such costs is reasonable under the circumstances. The charges for these
functions are included primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses
and do not necessarily reflect the amount of expenses that would have been
incurred by Covance on a stand-alone basis. In certain cases, related party
expenses allocated to Covance have not required reimbursement in cash and,
accordingly, have been treated as capital contributions. 13. Quarterly Financial Information Unaudited
