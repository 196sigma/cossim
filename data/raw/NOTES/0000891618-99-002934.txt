STERIGENICS INTERNATIONAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization
SteriGenics International, Inc. the Company was incorporated in the
state of California in 1978. In July 1997, the Company was reincorporated in the
state of Delaware. The Company performs contract sterilization and radiation
processing services using gamma radiation Gamma and electron beam radiation
E-Beam. The Company operates 13 Gamma facilities in several states and one
E-Beam facility in San Diego, California. During fiscal 1999, the Company
announced plans for two additional gamma facilities in the United States and one
irradiation complex in Thailand featuring Gamma and E-Beam. All three facilities
are expected to commence operation by the end of calendar 1999.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries, SteriGenics East Corporation,
SteriGenics International Holding Corporation and RSI Leasing, Inc. SteriGenics
East Corporation includes three facilities located along the eastern seaboard of
the United States. SteriGenics International Holding Corporation holds
investments in the Company joint venture in Taiwan see Note 9. In addition,
SteriGenics International Holding Corporation owns SteriGenics Cayman, which
owns SteriGenics Thailand Ltd. see Note 10. RSI Leasing, Inc. leases Cobalt 60
to the Company and includes a facility located in San Diego, California. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such
differences may be material to the financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from manufacturers is recognized upon the completion of
sterilization, irradiation processing or consultative services. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of revenues during fiscal years 1997, 1998 or 1999.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are recorded as an expense when incurred. Advertising
costs were approximately $289,000, $348,000 and $227,000 for the years ended
March 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The Company does not incur any
direct response advertising costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair
value. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the
financial institutions or issuers of the investments to the extent of the
amounts recorded on the balance sheet.
Short-Term Investments
The Company invests its excess cash in high-quality commercial paper with
maturity less than one year. At March 31, 1999, all short-term investments are
designated as available for sale. Interest and dividends on the investments are
included in interest income. There were no realized gains or losses on the
Company investments during fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999 as all investments were
held to maturity during the year. At March 31, 1999, the fair value of
short-term investments approximates cost.                    33
35
Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of financial instruments approximate the carrying
values at March 31, 1999 and 1998 using available market information and
appropriate valuation methodologies. The fair value of long-term debt is
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and the Company current
incremental borrowing rate.
Risks, Uncertainties, and Significant Concentrations
The Company trade receivables consist principally of amounts due from its
customers in the sterilization industry. The Company trade customers are
primarily in the United States. Management believes any concentration of credit
risk is substantially alleviated by the Company credit evaluation and
collection practices. The Company generally requires no collateral. Bad debt
experience and expenses have been insignificant.
The Company operations are dependent on its ability to obtain Cobalt 60
isotope or an equivalent radioactive material. Cobalt 60 isotope is a controlled
substance, supplied only by a limited number of vendors. If the Company is
unable to obtain adequate supplies of Cobalt 60 isotope at commercially
reasonable terms, its operations may be materially adversely affected.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of investments in cash equivalents and
short-term investments. The Company uses local banks and various investment
firms to invest its excess cash. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the
event of default by these institutions or issuers of the investments to the
extent of the amount recorded on the balance sheet.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Cobalt 60 isotope is amortized using an
accelerated method approximately 123% of net book value per year which
relates to the natural decay of the isotope. For all other property, plant and
equipment, depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives of three to thirty years. Amortization of Cobalt 60 is
included with depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.
Construction-in-Progress
From time to time, the Company builds or expands facilities. The cost of
construction of these facilities is reflected as construction-in-progress until
start-up of the facility, at which time the costs are reclassified to the
appropriate fixed asset category.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated
fair values of tangible and intangible net assets acquired. Goodwill is
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets
acquired.
Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, the Company accounts for
its employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB Opinion No. 25 and will provide pro forma disclosures of net income and
earnings per share as if the fair value basis method prescribed by FAS 123 had
been applied in measuring employee compensation expense see Note 4.
Net Income Per Share
In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share FAS 128, all prior period net income
per share amounts have been restated to reflect basic and diluted per share
amounts.
Except as noted below, basic net income per share is computed using the
weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Pro forma basic
net income per share is calculated as for basic net income per share, but
assumes conversion of all convertible Preferred Stock which converted
automatically in the initial public offering, even if antidilutive. Diluted net
income per                    35
36
share includes potential common shares, when dilutive, from stock options using
the treasury stock method and from convertible Preferred Stock using the
if-converted method.
The following table sets forth the computation of pro forma basic, basic and
diluted net income per share in thousands, except per share amounts                                        YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,

Options to purchase 88,250 and 305,995 shares of Common Stock were
outstanding in the years ended March 31, 1998 and 1999 respectively, but were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares
and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive.
Effective April 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This Statement
requires that all items recognized under accounting standards as components of
comprehensive earnings be reported in an annual financial statement that is
displayed with the same prominence as other annual financial statements. The
Company has elected to disclose its comprehensive earnings in its statement of
stockholders' equity.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, in fiscal
1999. Statement No. 131 supersedes Statement No. 14, Financial Reporting for
Segments of a Business Enterprise, and establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or
group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The
Company has determined that under Statement No. 131, it operates in one segment
of contract sterilization. The Company customers and operations are primarily
in the United States.
New Accounting Pronouncements
In April 1999, AcSEC issued Statement of Position SOP 98-5, Reporting
on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. This SOP provides guidance on the
financial reporting of start-up costs and organization costs. It requires the
costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred.
The SOP is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1998. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SOP No98-5
will have a material impact on its financial statements.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued statement No.
133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is
required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15, 1999. Management does
not anticipate that the adoption of the new Statement will have a significant
effect on results of operations or the financial position of the Company.                    36

4. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Stock Option Plans
Under the 1985 Incentive Stock Option Plan and the Second Amended and
Restated 1986 Stock Option Plans, the Board of Directors were able to grant
options to key employees to purchase up to 1,210,000 shares of Common Stock at
not less than fair value on the date of grant, as determined by the Board of
Directors. The options generally vest with respect to 24% of the shares one year
after the options' grant date and with respect to 2% of the shares on a monthly
basis for the next 38 months. The option term is ten years, and options expire
at the end of the term.
In July 1997, the stockholders approved the adoption of the 1997 Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended, and the 1997 Stock Plan, under which a total of
1,025,000 shares and 175,000 shares, respectively, of the Company authorized
but unissued Common Stock have been reserved for issuance thereunder.
Subsequently, the remaining available shares under the 1986 Stock Plan and the
1997 Stock Plan became available for issuance under the 1997 Equity Incentive
Plan.
Activity under the option plans was as follows                           OUTSTANDING OPTIONS

terms of their outstanding options to lower the exercise price to the then fair
value of $490 per share, and to reset the vesting schedule. Included above are
options to purchase 172,564 shares of Common Stock canceled and regranted during
fiscal 1996 with the amended terms.
At March 31, 1999, options outstanding under the stock option plans were as

978,032                     456,862
At March 31, 1997, options to purchase 487,014 shares of Common Stock were
exercisable at an average exercise price of $501 per share. At March 31, 1998,
options to purchase 431,290 shares of Common Stock were exercisable at an
average exercise price of $500 per share. At March 31, 1999, 543,054 shares
were available for future grant under the plans.
The Company has elected to follow APB Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FAS
123, requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise
price of the Company employee stock options equals the fair value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.
Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by FAS 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for
its employee stock options under the fair value method of FAS 123. For options
granted prior to the initial public offering, the fair value for these options
was estimated at the date of grant using the minimum value option pricing
method. For options granted subsequent to the initial public offering, the fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions were
used for the years ended March 31                         1997   1998   1999
Risk-free interest rate %   637   579   455
Dividend yield..    --    --            Volatility factor..    --   068   078
Expected option life years   357   520   555   The minimum value option valuation method may be used by non-public
companies to value an award. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation
models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
expected option life. Because the Company employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and
because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the
fair value estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not
necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee
stock options.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock-based compensation plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those
plans consistent with a method prescribed in FAS 123, the Company net income
and net income per share would have been decreased to the pro forma amounts
indicated below                                1997       1998       1999
Pro forma net income..   $  3,139,858   $  4,288,371   $  5,990,261
Pro forma basic net income per share.       065       069       077
Pro forma diluted net income per share       061       064       072   The weighted average fair value of options granted in fiscal 1997, 1998 and
1999 was $110, $597 and $1084 per share, respectively.                    39
40
Because FAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to March
31, 1995, its pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until the year ending
March 31, 2000. The effects of applying FAS 123 pro forma disclosures are not
likely to be representative of the effects on net income for future years.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In June 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Purchase Plan. The Company has reserved 400,000 shares of Common Stock
for issuance thereunder. Under the Purchase Plan, qualified employees are
entitled to purchase shares through payroll deductions at 85% of the fair market
value at the beginning or end of the offering period, whichever is lower. As of
March 31, 1999, shares issued under the Purchase Plan totaled 120,653.
Notes Receivable from Sale of Common Stock to Employees
At March 31, 1998, the Company had notes receivable in the amount of $49,000
arising from the sale of Common Stock to employees. Such notes bear interest at
7% to 9%, are collateralized by the related stock of the Company and are due
between April 1998 and August 2000. During the first quarter of fiscal 1999,
repayments of $49,000 were received by the Company. At March 31, 1999, no
amounts were outstanding.
5. TAXES ON INCOME
The provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31 consists of the
following                       1997     1998      1999
Federal:
Current..   $1,276,373   $2,395,188   $1,480,451

Deferred..     69,901     37,991    527,760
208,175    438,858    646,139
$2,099,065   $3,407,683   $5,049,632
The tax benefits associated with stock options reduce taxes currently
payable as shown by $93,000 and 14 million for 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Such benefits were credited to additional paid in capital.
The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal income tax rate 34% for 1997 and 1998, and 35% for 1999
to income before taxes as follows                              1997      1998     1999
Statutory tax..   $1,806,702   $2,962,813   $4,485,903
State taxes, net of federal benefit    137,395    289,646    419,990
Other..    154,968    155,224    143,739
$2,099,065   $3,407,683   $5,049,632
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 1998 and 1999 are as
follows                                1998      1999
Deferred tax assets:
Tax credit carryforwards..   $ 2,013,422   $ 1,060,330
Reserves and accruals..    2,001,993    1,376,362
Other      302,625     310,625
Total deferred tax assets..    4,318,040    2,747,317
Deferred tax liabilities:
Depreciation..   13,014,098   14,827,317
Other      215,545     282,407
Total deferred tax liabilities   13,229,643   15,109,724
Net deferred tax liabilities..   $ 8,911,603   $12,362,407
40
41
At March 31, 1999, the Company had federal alternative minimum tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $11 million, which do not expire. Utilization of
the carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership
change limitations provided the by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar
state provisions.
Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds received, were $805,000 17 million and $18 million during fiscal 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
6. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
Effective February 1, 1990, the Company established a defined contribution
retirement plan, the SteriGenics 401k plan, which covers all employees, age 21
or older, with at least six months of service. Employees may make contributions
by a percentage reduction in their salaries of up to a statutory limit of
$10,000 for calendar year 1999. Company contributions consist of matching funds
equal to 50% of the first 5% of employee eligible earnings contributed, as well
as discretionary profit sharing amounts. Effective April 1, 1996, the Company
increased the matching contribution percentage from 25% to 50%. Company
contributions were $122,000, $176,000 and $204,000 for fiscal 1997, 1998 and
1999, respectively. Administrative expenses related to the plan are not
significant.
7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position or
results of operations.
