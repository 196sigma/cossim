NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company develops, markets, sells and distributes strategic asset
management solutions used by businesses, government agencies and other
organizations to manage their high-value capital assets, such as plants,
facilities, production equipment, and IT assets. The Company integrated suite
of applications optimizes performance, improves productivity and service levels
and enables asset-related sourcing and procurement across the entire spectrum of
strategic assets.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MRO Software,
Inc. MROI and its majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior
year financial statement items have been reclassified to conform to the current
year presentation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
GAAP. These accounting principles require management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. To the extent there are material differences between these
estimates and actual results, our financial statements would be affected.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents
consist mainly of money market mutual funds, which are stated at cost plus
accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to
concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of temporary cash investments,
marketable securities and accounts receivable. The majority of our cash is
maintained with several financial institutions in the United States and Europe.
Deposits held with these banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on
such deposits. The counterparties to the agreements relating to marketable
securities and investment instruments consist of various United States
governmental units and financial institutions of high credit standing. Credit
risk on accounts receivable is minimized as a result of the diverse nature of
the Company customer base. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of
its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed
necessary.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
The Company comprehensive income is comprised of net income, foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale investments, net of tax. Comprehensive income is included in
the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amounts stated at cost of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because
of their short-term nature.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
Assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates at the
balance sheet dates. The translation adjustments made on translation of the
balance sheet are recorded as a separate component of stockholders' equity.
Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange
rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in determining
net income. The Company
Page 39 recorded a net loss of $506 thousand, a net gain of $532 thousand, a net loss of
$85 thousand for fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES
The Company marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and
are stated at their fair value. All marketable securities are held in the
Company name and are held in custody with a major financial institution. The
fair value of marketable securities was determined based on quoted market
prices. Unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as
available-for-sale are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity
and are included in other comprehensive income.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and
amortization.
Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful lives of the assets as
follows Description                  Estimated Useful Life
-                                          
Computer equipment & software             3 years
Vehicles                       3 years
Furniture and fixtures                5 years   Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the
shorter of their estimated useful life or the remaining term of the lease.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon retirement or
sale, the cost of the assets disposed of and the related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is
included in the determination of net income.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
GOODWILL
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Board SFAS No.
141, Business Combinations, the Company accounts for acquisitions under the
purchase method of Accounting. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized, but instead, be tested annually for impairment or whenever events
occur which may indicate possible impairment. Also, in accordance with this
standard, the Company ceased amortization of goodwill associated with
acquisitions purchased prior to the adoption date, at the beginning of its
fiscal year, October 1, 2002. The impairment analysis performed at September 30,
2004 concluded that no impairment of goodwill occurred.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL
Long-lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The
Company periodically reviews the long-lived assets, including intangible assets
resulting from acquisitions, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their
fair value. The Company estimates whether future cash flows expected to result
from the use of assets exceed the carrying amount of the assets. In the event
that the Company judges that an impairment exists, all or a portion of the asset
will be written off based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the
fair value of the asset. In order to determine the fair value, the Company
obtains quoted market prices or utilizes valuation techniques, such as
discounted cash flows.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Costs related to research, design and development of products are charged
to research and development expenses as incurred. Software development costs are
capitalized beginning when a product technological feasibility has been
established and ending when a product is available for general release to
customers. Generally, our products are released soon after technological
feasibility has been established. Costs eligible for capitalization under SFAS
No. 86 were not significant to our consolidated financial statements and all
software development costs have been expenses as incurred.
INCOME PER SHARE
Basic income loss per share is computed by dividing income or loss
available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted income per share is computed by dividing income or loss
available to common shareholders by the weighted average of common shares
outstanding plus dilutive
Page 40 potential common shares. For purposes of this calculation, stock options are
considered dilutive potential common shares in periods in which they have a
dilutive effect. All potential dilutive common shares are excluded from the
computation of net loss per share because they are anti-dilutive.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach
for accounting and reporting for income taxes. The Company computes deferred
income taxes, net of valuation allowances, for the estimated future tax effects
of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in
the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than
not to be realized. Any increase in a valuation allowance could have a material
adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which
the determination is made.
The Company has not provided for the U.S. income tax on earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries as it considers certain of these earnings are intended to
be permanently reinvested. At September 30, 2004, the undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries were $111 million.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
SOFTWARE PRODUCTS
The Company primarily licenses its software products under noncancellable
license agreements. Software license fee revenues are generally recognized upon
contract execution and product shipment, provided that collection of the
resulting receivable is deemed probable, the fees are fixed or determinable, and
no significant modification or customization of the software is required.
Our customers do not have any right of return except as stipulated under a
standard 90-day warranty that runs concurrent with post contract support PCS.
The Company does not maintain any reserves with respect to this warranty based
on a history of performance of our software. On the rare occasion that a
customer insists on conditions of acceptance, the Company defers revenue until
the customer acceptance is obtained and the condition has been satisfied.
Revenue from products sold through indirect channels resellers is
recognized upon shipment of the software, as long as evidence of an arrangement
exists, collectibility is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable and the
resellers obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of our product.
Revenue is recorded net of any commissions or discounts. Our resellers do not
have any right of return beyond the standard 90-day performance warranty that
runs concurrent with PCS.
SERVICES REVENUES
Services revenues are comprised of consulting and training fees related to
installation of the Company software solutions, maintenance/support PCS
contracts for software products, and subscription based fees related to the
Company Online Commerce Services OCS business. Consulting and training
services are generally recognized as the services are performed. PCS revenues
are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, generally one year.
Customers typically subscribe to OCS on an annual basis and revenue is recorded
as services revenue and recognized on a straight-line basis over the applicable
subscription period.
Many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services
sold separately under consulting contracts. We consider whether the services
revenue can be recognized separately from the software revenue by analyzing the
nature of the services i.e. if the services are essential to the functionality
of the software, the level of risk, availability of services from other
vendors, acceptance criteria, milestone payments and fixed price terms. For
those contracts that contain fixed
Page 41 price arrangements, if we can reliably estimate the hours required to complete
the implementation services and if we have vendor specific objective evidence
VSOE for the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants, we recognize the
software license fee separately from the services revenues. The services
revenues are recognized as they are delivered and the related costs as they are
incurred. If at any point in time the costs exceed revenues, we immediately
accrue for estimated losses using cost estimates that are based on average fully
burdened daily rates applicable to the consulting organization delivering the
services. For those fixed price arrangements where we cannot reliably estimate
the hours required to complete the implementation services and we do not have
VSOE for the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants, the software
license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the
period the consulting services are provided.
MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS
The Company multiple element arrangements could include the following three
elements: a software license, b PCS, and c consulting, training and other
services services. Revenue is allocated to the elements of the arrangement
based upon the vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value of each
element. The Company uses the residual method to recognize its software license
revenue, because while we are able to determine the VSOE of fair value of PCS
and services, we are unable to determine the fair value of software licenses.
Under the residual method, the fair value of undelivered elements PCS and/or
services is deferred and recognized when the PCS and/or services are delivered.
The difference between the amount of the total arrangement and the amount
attributable to the elements for which fair value is determinable PCS and/or
services is recognized as software license revenue. VSOE is established for PCS
and is based on the price of PCS when sold separately. The PCS renewal rate is a
relatively consistent percentage of the stipulated software license fee, offered
to all customers. VSOE for consulting services is based on fixed hourly rates
set according to the skill level of the consultant required. VSOE for training
services is based on an established per-student fee structure.
We assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and
recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met. Our
standard payment terms are net 30 days. Payment terms that extend beyond net 30
days from the contract date but are within twelve months are generally deemed to
be fixed or determinable based on our successful history of collecting on such
arrangements. For those customers who are deemed not to be credit-worthy,
revenue is deferred until payment is received.
Shipping and handling fees associated with our products are recorded as
revenue and the associated costs are recorded as cost of software sales.
ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND SALES RETURNS
The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts, which reflect the
Company estimate of the amounts owed by customers that customers will be
unable or otherwise fail to pay. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on
Management assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts and factors
such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable
balance, and current economic conditions. Management performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and limits the amount of
credit when deemed necessary. The Company did not record a provision for
estimated sales returns. Based on our history of sales returns and an analysis
of credit memos, we determined that a provision was not needed.
DEFERRED REVENUE
Revenue on all software license transactions in which there are significant
outstanding obligations is deferred and recognized once such obligations are
fulfilled. Deferred revenue also includes maintenance contracts, and OCS fees
billed in advance.
ADVERTISING EXPENSE
The Company recognizes advertising expense as incurred. Advertising expense
was approximately $33 million, $47 million, and $49 million for fiscal years
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
Page 42 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company grants stock options to its employees and outside directors.
Such grants are for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the
fair value of the shares at the date of grant. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 SFAS 148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 SFAS 123 to provide alternative methods of transition to
the SFAS 123 fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 requires disclosure of the effects of an
entity accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on
reported net income loss and earnings per share in annual and interim
financial statements.
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation using the
intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations. The fair value of the Company stock options was estimated
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model was developed for use
in estimated fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
are fully transferable. This model requires the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimates, in management opinion, the Black-Scholes
model does not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of its stock options.
The fair value of the Company stock options was estimated using the
following weighted-average assumptions                          Stock Options

2004       2003     2002

Dividend yield              0%        0%      0   Under SFAS 123, the weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted
during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $670, $736 and $1421 per share,
respectively.
Proforma information
The Company complies with the pro forma disclosure requirements of SFAS
123 as amended by SFAS 148. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis as if the Company had applied

as all stock-based awards granted under the Company plans consist of stock
options that have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant.
CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 requires that if an entity
is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets,
liabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity should be
included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity. In December
2003, the FASB issued a revision to FIN 46, FIN 46 R, to address certain
implementation issues. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and
exempts certain entities from its requirements.
FIN 46 R requires the application of either FIN 46 or FIN 46 R by
Public Entities as defined in paragraph 395 of FASB Statement No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation to all Special Purpose Entities
SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or
annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. All entities created
after January 31, 2003 by Public Entities were already required to be analyzed
under FIN 46, and they must continue to do so, unless FIN 46 R is adopted
early. FIN 46 Rwill be applicable to all non-SPEs created prior to February 1,
2003 by Public Entities that are not small business issuers at the end of the
first interim or annual reporting period ending after March 15, 2004.
The Company does not enter into transactions involving entities whose
activities are primarily related to securitizations or other forms of
asset-backed financings or single-lessee leasing arrangements, and thus the
required adoption of FIN 46R for all SPE created prior to February 1, 2003 had
no impact on the Company. The Company has not created any entities subsequent to
January 31, 2003 that requires accounting under FIN 46. The Company believes
that it does not have variable interest entities as defined in FIN 46 R. The
adoption of FIN 46R has no impact on the Company financial statements.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 AJCA was signed
into law. The AJCA contains a series of provisions several of which are
pertinent to the Company.
The AJCA creates a temporary incentive for U.S. multinational corporations
to repatriate accumulated income abroad by providing an 85% dividends received
deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. It has
been the Company practice to permanently reinvest all foreign earnings into
its foreign operations and the Company currently still plans to continue to
reinvest its foreign
Page 44 earnings permanently into its foreign operations. Should the Company determine
that it plans to repatriate any of its foreign earnings, the Company will be
required to establish a deferred tax liability on such earnings.
The AJCA eliminates the extraterritorial income exclusion for transactions
occurring after December 31, 2004. However, the AJCA provides transitional
relief, allowing an exclusion of 80% of the exclusion previously allowable for
transactions occurring in calendar 2005 and 60% for transactions occurring in
calendar 2006.
The AJCA also provides U.S. corporations with an income tax deduction equal
to a stipulated percentage of qualified income from domestic production
activities qualified activities. The deduction, which cannot exceed 50% of
annual wages paid, is phased in as follows: 3% of qualified activities of the
Company fiscal years 2006 and 2007, 6% in fiscal years 2008 through 2010, and
9% in fiscal year 2011 and thereafter. The Company believes that it qualifies
for the deduction. In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued a staff position FAS 109-a indicating that the domestic manufacturing
deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction. As such, the tax
benefit of the deduction will be accounted for in the periods in which the
qualifying activities occur, i.e., the years in which the deductions are taken
on the Company tax returns. This benefit will be included in the Company
annual effective tax rate, but will not result in a re-measurement of deferred
income taxes.
The AJCA may have an impact on the Company tax rate for 2005 and future
years. The outcome at this time is not yet known.
B. INCOME TAXES   The components of income/loss before income taxes and the

Net deferred      $ 9,081  $11,509
At September 30, 2004, the Company had total domestic net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $19 million attributable to the acquisition of
Applied Image Technology, Inc. AIT. In accordance with the provisions of
Internal Revenue Code Section 382, the Company utilization of AIT net
operating loss carryforward is estimated to be limited to approximately $600
thousand per year. The domestic net operating loss carryforwards will generally
expire in varying amounts from 2008 through 2018. At September 30, 2004, the
Company had state apportioned net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$31 million expiring in various years from 2005 through 2022, which are also
subject to statutory limitations on their utilization.
The Company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax
asset. The deferred tax asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based
on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in
future periods. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is
considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance. The Company
believes future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax
benefit of the net deferred tax assets. In the event that it is determined that
our financial projections change and it becomes more likely than not that we
cannot realize the net deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the net deferred
tax assets will be made and will result in a charge to income in the period such
a determination is made. The net deferred tax asset amount as of September 30,
2004 is $91 million.
The Company has established a valuation allowance with respect to various
net operating losses assumed from acquisitions. The valuation
allowance was based upon expected earnings within individual tax jurisdictions
and statutory limitations imposed by tax jurisdictions, which will more likely
than not reduce our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards. The
reduction in the net valuation allowance in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 is
primarily attributable to the utilization of previously unbenefited losses.
C. ACQUISITIONS
On July 9, 2004, the Company completed the acquisition of Raptor ASA
Corporation, a provider of software solutions for the aviation industry. The
total purchase price of the acquisition was $11 million. The amount of $600
thousand was paid at closing. The amount of $200 thousand is payable within
thirty days after the first anniversary of the closing and $300 thousand is
payable within thirty days after the second anniversary of the closing. Both of
these payments are contingent upon the completion of knowledge transfer
milestones, however, neither payment is contingent on any employment of the
selling principals with the Company. The Company allocated the purchase price as
such: $910 thousand to acquired technology, $560 thousand to goodwill and $370
thousand to deferred tax liability. The deferred tax liability represents the
cumulative tax effect of the book to tax difference in basis for the acquired
technology. The acquired technology will be amortized over five years.
On June 14, 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of MainControl, Inc.
MainControl, a provider of IT asset management solutions. The purpose of the
Page 47 acquisition was to expand the Company product base and enable us to offer
products that manage a broader range of an enterprise strategic assets. Under
the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company acquired all outstanding
equity of MainControl for a combination of MRO common stock and cash. The
Company paid $32 million in cash, of which $420 thousand was contingent on
certain revenue thresholds, and issued 1,096,296 shares valued at $1380 per
share. The share price was calculated by averaging the closing price of a share
of MRO Software stock for five days before and five days after the
announcement date of the merger, as reported by the NASDAQ National Market. The
total purchase price, including transaction expenses of $784 thousand, was $186
million. The Company allocated the purchase price as such: $37 million to
current and other assets, $31 million to acquired technology, $12 million to
customer contracts, $100 thousand to backlog, $200 thousand to software
documentation, $700 thousand to a non-compete agreement, $158 million to
goodwill, and $62 million to current liabilities. The purchase price allocation
was based on then-current intentions for future use of the acquired assets,
estimate of future projected cash flows, analysis of historical financial
results and review of customer contracts. Acquired technology will be amortized
over six and one-half years, customer contracts will be amortized over four
years, backlog will be amortized over one year, software documentation will be
amortized over three years and the non-compete agreement will be amortized over
two years.
D. SALE OF ASSETS
On January 17, 2003, the Company sold the industrial data normalization
services operations to International Materials Solutions, Inc. the Buyer.
The sale included software and technology used in such operations, contracts
with customers, suppliers and vendors, and trademarks associated with such
operations. Additionally, the workforce was included as part of the sale. The
Company retained comprehensive, non-exclusive rights to the software and
technology used in the business, which has also been embedded in the Company
MAXIMOR and OCS offerings. As consideration for the assets, the Buyer assumed
all liabilities arising in connection with the assets and the associated
business operations from and after January 1, 2003 and delivered two promissory
notes in the face amount of $1 million each, together with a stock purchase
warrant representing the right to purchase five 5% percent of the Buyer
common stock. One promissory note was a term note payable over a period of three
years commencing July 1, 2003, and the other promissory note was a balloon note
payable in full on June 30, 2006. The gain recorded on the sale of these assets
was $407 thousand and was included in other income in fiscal 2003. For purposes
of calculating the gain on the sale, the $1 million promissory balloon note
receivable was not valued due to uncertainty of collection and no value was
attributed to the stock purchase warrants due to the limited operating history
of the buyer.
On July 29, 2004, the Company and the Buyer entered into a termination
agreement where the Company consented to the sale of the Buyer business to an
unrelated party and settled the outstanding obligation between the Company and
the Buyer. In exchange for $13 million, received September 2004, the Company
released the Buyer from all obligations due pursuant to the original January 17,
2003 sale. The gain recorded as a result of the termination agreement was $452
thousand and is included in other income in fiscal 2004. The gain represents the
difference between the $13 million received by the Company and the carrying
amount of the term note.

outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted net
income/loss per share because the exercise price of the options was greater
than the weighted average market price of the common stock during the period.
Common stock equivalents of 479,000 and 224,000 shares were included in the
computation of diluted net income per share for fiscal 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Options to purchase shares of the Company common stock of
717,000 for fiscal 2002 were outstanding but were excluded from the computations
of diluted net loss per share as the effect was anti-dilutive due to the
Company net loss.
F. MARKETABLE SECURITIES   The Company classifies its marketable securities as available for sale and
carries them at aggregate fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are included
as a component of stockholders' equity, net of tax effect. Realized gains and
losses are determined based on the specific identified cost of the securities.

On March 10, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted the 1994
Employee Stock Purchase Plan that provides for a maximum issuance of 450,000
shares of Common Stock for purchase by eligible employees at 85% of the lower of
the fair market value of the Company Common Stock on either the first or last
day of the semi-annual offering period. No compensation expense is recorded in
connection with the plan.
Page 54   On January 16, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan authorizing the issuance of up to 750,000 shares of the Company
Common Stock. Eligible employees may purchase Common Stock of the Company
through payroll deductions. The purchase price is 85% of the fair market value
based on the lowest price on a the semi-annual offering commencement date b
the semi-annual offering termination date or c the first of each month in a
semi-annual offering period. The effective date of the 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan is June 1, 2002. The Board of Directors also voted to terminate
the Company 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective May 30, 2002.
During fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, employees purchased 99,831
shares at a price of $758 and 90,620 shares at a price of $995 for the
offering periods ended November 30, 2003 and May 31, 2004, respectively. Total
shares purchased in 2003 and 2002 were 199,633 and 121,126, respectively.
L. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Unvested stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions are recorded
as stock-based compensation as a reduction of stockholders' equity. The amount
recorded is equal to the difference between the exercise price of the unvested
options and the fair market value of our stock as of the closing date of the
acquisition. Restricted stock granted to employees that is subject to vesting,
is also recorded as deferred stock-based compensation equal to the difference
between the purchase price and the fair market value of the stock at the date of
grant. Deferred stock-based compensation is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting term of these options and stock awards.
PREFERRED STOCK
On March 11, 1994, the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $001 par value was authorized by the Stockholders of the Company. The
Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more
series and to fix rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
dividends, and the number of shares constituting any series and the designation
of such series.
In January 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a stockholder
rights plan by declaring a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase
right one Right on each share of the Company Common Stock outstanding on
January 27, 1998 or, in certain circumstances, issued thereafter. Initially, the
Rights are not exercisable, are not represented by separate Right certificates
and do not trade separately from the Company Common Stock. Ten days after a
tender offer or acquisition of 15% or more of the Company common stock, each
right may be exercised for $140 Exercise Price to purchase one one
thousandth of one share of the Company Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock. Each one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock will generally be afforded economic rights similar to one share
of the Company common stock. In addition after such rights are triggered, each
Right entitles the holder to purchase common stock of the Company with a fair
value of twice the Exercise Price or, in certain circumstances, securities of
the acquiring company for the Exercise price. Each Right expires in January 2008
and, during specified periods, the Company may redeem or exchange each Right for
$01 or one share of common stock. The Rights Agreement has been filed by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a
Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated February 2, 1998. Stockholders are
urged to review the Rights Agreement for a complete understanding of the Rights
Plan. The Rights Plan, while providing the Board of Directors with flexibility
in connection with possible acquisitions and deterring unfair or coercive
takeover tactics, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third
party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock.
COMMON STOCK
In December 2000, the Company issued a stock purchase warrant to i2
Technologies, Inc. i2 under which i2 had the right to purchase up to 500,000
shares of the Company common stock at an exercise price of $1025 per share.
The Company valued the warrant at $33 million using the Black-Scholes valuation
model, with the following assumptions: 1 risk-free interest rate of 48%; 2
life of 25 years Page 55 and 3 volatility of 105%. The warrant was immediately exercisable and was
recorded as a one-time non-cash sales and marketing expense in the three months
ended December 31, 2000. On March 14, 2002, i2 exercised the entire warrant on a
net exercise or cashless basis, pursuant to which the exercise price was
paid by reducing the number of shares issued, and as a result 268,823 shares
were issued to i2 upon exercise of the warrant and there was no cash received by
the Company.
On September 28, 2000, the Company executed a restricted stock agreement
with one employee. In exchange for continued employment, the employee received
15,000 shares vesting equally in amounts of 5,000 on each September 30, 2001,
2002, and 2003. In May 2001, the vesting period of the 15,000 shares was
amended. Under the amended agreement, 5,000 shares vested on October 1, 2001,
and the remaining 10,000 shares vested on January 2, 2002 and the restricted
stock agreement was no longer conditioned on employment. The shares were
recorded at fair market value on the date of issuance as deferred compensation
and the related amount was recorded as sales and marketing expense during fiscal
2001, as there is no continuing obligation of the employee beyond September 30,
2001
On June 18, 2001, each non-employee Director received an outright grant of
6,250 shares of restricted stock vesting on a quarterly basis over three years
in twelve equal installments vesting on the 15th day of the second month of each
quarter, subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. The shares were
recorded at fair market value $1265 per share on the date of issuance as
deferred compensation and the related amount is being recorded as general and
administrative expenses over the vesting period.
On January 27, 2003, each non-employee director received an outright grant
of 6,250 shares of restricted stock vesting on a quarterly basis over three
years in twelve equal installments vesting on the 15th day of the second month
of each quarter, subject to acceleration under certain circumstances. The shares
were recorded at fair market value $1173 per share on the date of issuance as
deferred compensation and the related amount is being recorded as general and
administrative expenses over the vesting period.
On March 15, 2004, each non-employee director and the Chairman of the Board
received an outright grant of 4,800 shares of restricted stock vesting on a
quarterly basis over three years in twelve equal installments on the 15th day of
the second month of each quarter, subject to acceleration under certain
circumstances. The shares were recorded at fair market value $1189 per share
on the date of issuance as deferred compensation and the value of the vested
shares is being recorded as general and administrative expense.
M. GUARANTOR ARRANGEMENTS
We warrant that our software products will perform substantially in
accordance with the product specifications as contained in certain associated
documentation, which is provided with the products, for a period of ninety days
from initial delivery of the products to the customer. Our sole obligation under
this warranty is to use reasonable efforts to correct a verified problem that is
brought to our attention during the warranty period, or if we are unable to
provide a correction, we are obligated to accept the return of the product and
refund the license fee paid. We warrant that our professional services will be
provided in accordance with good professional practice, and that any software
developed by our services organization will perform substantially in accordance
with its approved specifications for a period of thirty days from initial
delivery of the services to the customer. Our sole obligation under this
warranty is to use reasonable efforts to correct a verified problem that is
brought to our attention during the warranty period, or if we are unable to
provide a correction, we are obligated to accept the return of the deliverables
and refund the fee paid for the services. If necessary, we would provide for the
estimated cost of product and services warranties based on specific warranty
claims and claim history. However, we have never incurred significant expense
under our product or services warranties, our liability for breach of warranty
is limited to the amount of the license or services fees actually paid, and we
maintain insurance covering such claims in an amount sufficient to cover a
refund of the license or services fees paid by any particular customer during
the last 12 months. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these
Page 56 warranty obligations is minimal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded
for these warranty obligations as of September 30, 2004.
Under our standard end-user license agreement, we agree to indemnify our
customers against infringement claims that may be brought by third parties
asserting that our products infringe on certain intellectual property rights. In
our services agreements with customers, we will also, as a matter of standard
practice, agree to indemnify customers a against claims that may be brought by
third parties asserting that the results of our services infringe on certain
intellectual property rights, b against damages caused by our breach of
certain confidentiality provisions in the contract, and c against damages to
personal property, and death, caused by our services personnel while on-site at
customer premises. These indemnification provisions are generally based on our
standard contractual terms. All such provisions, whether based on our standard
contracts or negotiated with a given customer, are entered into in the normal
course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss is remote. The
terms of the indemnifications as negotiated may vary in duration and nature, and
our obligations to indemnify may be unlimited as to amount. There have been no
demands for indemnity and the contingencies triggering the obligation to
indemnify have not occurred to our knowledge and are not expected to occur. The
Company maintains insurance that covers such indemnification obligations, and
the amount of coverage that we maintain is sufficient to cover a refund of the
license and services fees received from any particular customer during the last
12 months. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant
to any such indemnity obligations. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded
for any such indemnity obligations as of September 30, 2004.
When we acquire a business or a company, we may assume liability for certain
events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. The
maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make for
such obligations is undeterminable at this time. All of these obligations were
grand fathered under the provisions of FIN No. 45 as they were in effect prior
to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for the
assumption of any such liabilities as of September 30, 2004.

MRO Software carries out periodic evaluations, under the supervision of the
Company management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon such
evaluations, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of September 30, 2004, our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective to timely alert them to any material information relating to the
Company including its consolidated subsidiaries that would be required to be
included in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While there have been no significant changes in the Company internal controls
or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent
to their evaluation, the Company is currently undergoing a comprehensive effort
to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Compliance is
required for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. This effort includes
documenting and testing of internal controls. To date, the Company has not
identified any material weaknesses in its internal control as defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Company will continue with its
efforts of compliance and will modify or improve its controls as needed. The
matters noted herein have been discussed with the Company Audit Committee.
