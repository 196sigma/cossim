REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors of
Dobson Communications Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dobson
Communications Corporation an Oklahoma corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Dobson Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. ORGANIZATION   The Company, through its predecessors, was organized in 1936 as Dobson
Telephone Company and adopted its current organizational structure in 2000. The
Company is a provider of rural and suburban wireless telephone services.
2000 RECAPITALIZATION
Management of the Company completed a recapitalization of the Company
immediately prior to and in conjunction with its initial public offering of its
common stock on February 9, 2000. This recapitalization included   - the conversion and redemption of its outstanding Class D preferred stock
and Class E preferred stock for cash and the issuance of old Class A
common stock   - the conversion of old Class A common stock into Class B common stock   - the creation of Class A common stock issued in the Company initial
public offering   - a 11144 for 1 split of new Class B common stock   - the retirement of the Company Class A preferred stock   - the creation of a new Class D common stock to be issued upon the exercise
of options under the Company amended 1996 stock option plan; and
- redesignated formerly authorized Class F and G Preferred Shares to
undesignated preferred shares.
Subsequent to this recapitalization, the Company has outstanding only
Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class D common stock, 1225% senior
preferred stock and 13% senior preferred stock.
On February 9, 2000, the Company completed its initial public offering of
25 million shares of Class A common stock, and the sale of an additional
15 million shares of Class A common stock to AT Wireless, for net proceeds
after commissions and expenses of $5454 million. The Company used
$533 million of the net proceeds to pay accrued dividends on its Class D
preferred stock and to redeem its Class E preferred stock. An additional
$3825 million was used as a capital contribution to its joint venture with AT
Wireless which acquired American Cellular Corporation American Cellular. The
Company used the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and other
general corporate purposes.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GROWTH
The Company has substantial indebtedness and debt service requirements and
is subject to significant financial restrictions and limitations. If the Company
is unable to satisfy any of the covenants under the credit facilities described
in Note 6, including financial covenants, the Company will be unable to borrow
under the credit facilities during such time period to fund planned capital
expenditures, its ongoing operations or other permissible uses.
The Company ability to manage future growth will depend upon its ability
to monitor operations, control costs, maintain effective quality controls and
significantly expand the Company internal management, technical and accounting
systems, all of which will result in higher operating expenses.

1. ORGANIZATION: CONTINUED
Any failure to expand these areas and to implement and improve such systems,
procedures and controls in an efficient manner at a pace consistent with the
growth of the Company business could have a material adverse effect on the
Company business, financial condition and results of operations.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of
all majority owned subsidiaries. For financial reporting purposes, the Company
reports 100% of revenues and expenses for the markets for which it provides
wireless services. However, in several of its markets, the Company holds less
than 100% of the equity ownership. The minority stockholders' and partners'
shares of income or losses in those markets are reflected in the consolidated
statements of operations as minority interests in income of subsidiaries. For
financial reporting purposes, the Company consolidates each subsidiary and
partnership in which it has a controlling interest greater than 50%.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated partnerships where the Company does not have a
controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method.
The Company is responsible for managing and providing administrative
services for certain partnerships of which the Company is the majority partner.
The Company is accountable to the partners and shareholders for the execution
and compliance with contracts and agreements and for filing of instruments
required by law, which are made on behalf of these partnerships and corporation.
The books and records of these partnerships and corporation are also maintained
by the Company.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company operates in one business segment pursuant to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
includes cash and short-term investments with original maturities of three
months or less.
INVENTORY
The Company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market on the
first-in, first-out method of accounting.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company assesses potential impairments of long-lived assets, certain
identifiable intangibles and goodwill when there is evidence that events or
changes in circumstances indicate that an asset carrying value may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of any recognized impairment would be based on the estimated fair value of the
asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset. No
such losses have been identified by the Company.

WIRELESS LICENSE ACQUISITION COSTS
Wireless license acquisition costs consist of amounts paid to acquire FCC
licenses to provide wireless services. Wireless license acquisition costs are
being amortized on a straight-line basis over fifteen years. Amortization
expense of $102,048,259, $87,625,001, and $30,064,955 was recorded in 2000, 1999
and 1998, respectively.
The ongoing value and remaining useful lives of intangible and other
long-term assets are subject to periodic evaluation and the Company currently
expects the carrying amounts to be fully recoverable.
DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS
Deferred financing costs consist primarily of fees incurred to secure
long-term debt. Deferred financing costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the term of the debt of eight to ten years. Amortization expense
related to these costs of $9,631,272, $6,364,802, and $1,965,461 was recorded in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
OTHER INTANGIBLES
Other intangibles consist of amounts paid to acquire FCC licenses to provide
PCS service and amounts paid to acquire customer lists. Customer list
acquisition costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over five years.
Amortization expense of $13,271,782, $10,716,164, and $1,219,940 was recorded in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
ADVERTISING COSTS
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as marketing and
selling expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
INCOME TAXES
The Company files a consolidated income tax return. Income taxes are
allocated among the various entities included in the consolidated tax return, as
agreed, based on the ratio of each entity taxable income loss to
consolidated taxable income loss. Deferred income taxes reflect the estimated
future tax effects of differences between financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities at year end.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company records service revenues over the period they are earned. The
cost of providing service is recognized as incurred. Airtime and toll revenue is
billed in arrears. The Company accrued estimated unbilled revenues for services
provided of approximately $5,105,000 and $2,626,000 as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, respectively, which are included in accounts receivable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Monthly access charges are billed in
advance and are reflected as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Equipment sales are recognized when the equipment is delivered
to the customer. Subscriber acquisition costs primarily commissions and losses
on equipment sales are expensed as incurred.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
As of December 31, 2000, the Company implemented SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition. The impact of implementing SAB
101 was not material to the Company revenues or results of operations for the
period ended December 31, 2000.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share,
requires two presentations of income per share--basic and diluted. Basic
income per share is computed by dividing income available to shareholders the
numerator by the weighted-average number of shares the denominator for the
period. The computation of diluted income per share is similar to basic income
per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of
additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive
shares, such as options, had been issued.
The Company Class D common stock is convertible into 11144 shares of
Class A common stock at the option of the holder. Due to this conversion
feature, basic loss per common share is computed by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding on an as converted basis for the period
described. Diluted net loss per common share has been omitted because the impact
of stock options and convertible preferred stock on the Company net loss per
common share is anti-dilutive.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS
In connection with providing wireless services to customers of other
wireless carriers, the Company has contractual agreements with those carriers
which provide for agreed-upon billing rates between the parties. Approximately
86%, 70% and 59% of the Company roaming revenue was earned from three wireless
carriers during the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Derivatives and Hedging SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes uniform hedge
accounting criteria for all derivatives requiring companies to formally
document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. Under SFAS 133, derivatives will be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes
in the fair value recognized as a component of comprehensive income or in
current earnings. SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137, Derivatives and
Hedging-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In addition,
SFAS 138, was issued in June 2000 as amendment to SFAS 133 and addresses issues
causing implementation difficulties. On January 1, 2001, in accordance with
SFAS 133, the Company recorded a liability and a net loss to comprehensive
income totaling $40 million relating to its interest rate hedges. In addition,
the Company recognized a net loss to comprehensive income totaling
$80 million, as a result of implementation of SFAS 133 by its 50% owned
unconsolidated subsidiary, American Cellular, on January 1, 2001.

extinguished its credit facilities for both Dobson Cellular Operations Company
and Dobson Operating Company and repurchase $1597 million outstanding principal

a portion of an eighth PCS license for approximately $11 million plus the
reimbursement of $07 million for all interest and principal actually paid by
the Company from the date of the agreement through the closing date of the sale.

states. The FCC is currently considering that subsidiary post-auction
application for grant of those licenses, as well as legal challenges to this
application. If the Company subsidiary is granted the licenses, it will cost a
total of approximately $5461 million and will add an estimated population of
193 million to its total coverage area. Included on the Company balance sheet
at December 31, 2000, was a deposit of $50 million to the FCC for purchases of

identifiable intangibles and goodwill when there is evidence that events or
changes in circumstances indicate that an asset carrying value may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized when the sum of the expected
future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of any recognized impairment would be based on the estimated fair value of the
asset subject to impairment compared to the carrying amount of such asset. No
such losses have been identified by the Company.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.
SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS
In connection with providing wireless services to customers of other
wireless carriers, the Company has contractual agreements with those carriers
which provide for agreed-upon billing rates between the parties. Approximately
73% of the Company roaming revenue was earned from three wireless carriers
during the period from February 15, 2000 through December 31, 2000.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In July 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
Derivatives and Hedging SFAS 133. SFAS 133 establishes uniform hedge
accounting criteria for all derivatives requiring companies to formally
document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. Under SFAS 133, derivatives will be recorded in the balance
sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes
in the fair value recognized as a component of comprehensive income or in
current earnings. SFAS 133, as amended by SFAS 137, Derivatives and
Hedging-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, will be
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. In addition,
SFAS 138, was issued in June 2000 as amendment to SFAS 133 and addresses issues
causing implementation difficulties. On January 1, 2001, in accordance with
SFAS 133, the Company recorded a liability and a net loss to comprehensive
income totaling $159 million relating to its interest rate hedges.
3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT   Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Newly constructed
wireless systems are added to property, plant and equipment at cost, which
includes contracted services, direct labor, materials overhead and capitalized
interest. For the period from February 15, 2000 through December 31, 2000
interest capitalized was not material. Existing property, plant and equipment
purchased through acquisitions is recorded at its fair value at the date of the
purchase. Repairs, minor replacements and maintenance are charged to operations
as incurred. The provisions for depreciation are provided using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes
of depreciable property. Depreciation expense totaling $42,667,136 was recorded
during the period from February 15, 2000 through December 31, 2000.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT   On February 25, 2000, the Company obtained a $175 billion credit facility
to retire existing debt and complete the acquisition of American.
At December 31, 2000, this credit facility included a $3000 million
revolving credit facility and $145 billion of term loan facilities. Interest on
the revolving credit facility and the term loan facilities is variable and is
based on a prime rate or a LIBOR formula, and has ranged in total between 85%
and 101% since inception. This credit facility is collateralized by
substantially all of the assets of the Company.

The Company credit facility imposes a number of restrictive covenants
that, among other things, limit the Company ability to incur additional
indebtedness, create liens, make capital expenditures and pay dividends. At
December 31, 2000, the Company was in violation of its interest coverage ratio
covenant. Subsequent to year-end, the Company received a waiver from its lenders
for this covenant violation. On March 2, 2001, the Company and its lenders
agreed to an amendment to its credit facility, which will become effective upon
the permanent repayment of $200 million of the term loans under its credit
facility with the proceeds of its offering of 95% senior subordinated notes
see Note 12. Management expects that the Company will be in compliance with
the revised covenants under the amended credit facility throughout 2001.

into interest rate hedge contracts to reduce exposure against rising interest
rates.

contract on its credit facility whereby the interest rate on the facility is
effectively fixed at a rate of 73% plus a factor based on the Company
leverage total weighted average rate of approximately 96% as of December 31,
2000. The agreement expires in June, 2001. The Company has also entered into an
interest rate hedge contract which expires June 30, 2002 which sets the interest
rate on $103 billion of debt at a rate between 67% and 80%, depending upon
the LIBOR rate on July 1, 2001.
