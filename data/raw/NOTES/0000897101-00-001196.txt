DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS 1.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NATURE OF BUSINESS
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Ag-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company. All material
inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company maintains a 50% ownership interest in certain affiliates.
Investments in these affiliates are accounted for under the equity method, and
accordingly, the Company share of these affiliates' net income loss is
recorded as other income in the consolidated statement of operations.
NATURE OF BUSINESS
The Company manufactures and distributes off-road equipment primarily
for agricultural fertilization, the application of crop protection chemicals,
and to a lesser extent, industrial waste treatment applications and other
industrial uses. The Company has positioned itself as the leading,
state-of-the-art manufacturer of agricultural application equipment, with an
emphasis on Site-Specific Agriculture and other high-tech hardware and
software product offerings. The Company generates a majority of its consolidated
revenues from its line of agricultural equipment which consists of
self-propelled, three and four-wheeled vehicles and related equipment for use in
the application of liquid and dry fertilizers and crop protection chemicals both
prior to planting crops pre-emergence and after crops emerge from the ground
post-emergence. The Company has concluded that it operates in one operating
segment.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company extends credit primarily to agricultural cooperatives and
dealers in the United States and Canada, and to international distributors. The
Company also provides financing for the sales of equipment through notes
receivable and operating leases.
INVENTORIES
Inventories, except used equipment, are stated at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is determined using the last in, first out LIFO method for all
inventories other than used equipment and inventories at the company European
subsidiary. Used equipment is valued at amounts that do not exceed estimated
fair market value less costs to sell.                    F-11 AG-CHEM EQUIPMENT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization of all property, plant and equipment is computed on straight-line
and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives                                   Years
Land improvements                  15-20
Buildings and improvements             15-40
Rental property                   5-40
Machinery and equipment               5-10
Rental equipment                  5
Transportation equipment              3-5
Office equipment and furniture           5-10
Computer equipment                 2-5
INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS
Intangible and other assets, net of accumulated amortization, consist
of the following                                            September 30,
2000     1999
Excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets purchased        $150     $654
Non-compete agreements                                 32     128
Deferred financing costs                                325     201
Manufacturing and marketing rights                           249     456
Equity investment                                  1,793      50
Other                                         196     215
Total intangible and other assets                          $2,745    $1,704
Intangible and other assets are capitalized at cost and, except for
deferred financing costs, are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
ranging from two to ten years. Deferred financing costs are being amortized over
the term of the financing using the effective-interest method.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
The Company research and development expenditures are expensed as
incurred and totaled $11,109, $9,391 and $10,846 for the years ended September
30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.                    F-12 AG-CHEM EQUIPMENT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For the Company Dutch operation, the Dutch guilder is considered the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated
using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation
effects are accumulated in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss
caption in stockholders' equity.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE
Earnings loss per common share are computed based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the respective years. The
Company has no potentially dilutive common shares.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
The Company made contributions of $414 to its profit sharing plan in
fiscal 1998.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers temporary cash investments with original
maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds future discounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. Long-lived
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or fair
value less costs to sell.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No. 133, effective for the
Company on October 1, 2000, establishes new standards for recognizing certain
derivatives as either assets or liabilities, and measuring those instruments at
fair value. The Company adopted this standard on October 1, 2000 and recorded
the fair value of its interest rate swap of $145 as an asset.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements SAB 101. SAB 101 summarizes certain SEC staff views in applying
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to
revenue recognition in financial statements. SAB 101 will be effective for the
Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001. Ag-Chem is currently
evaluating the impact of SAB 101 on its financial condition and results of

Most of the Company financial instruments are recorded on the balance
sheet. Quoted market prices generally are not available for all of the Company
financial instruments. Accordingly, fair values are based on judgments regarding
current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. These estimates involve uncertainties and matters
of judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
A description of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of each class of the Company financial instruments is as follows ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
As the average collection period for these is less than 45 days, the carrying
amount approximates fair value.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated by discounting
future cash flows using current discount rates that reflect the risks associated
with similar types of loans.
NOTE PAYABLE TO BANKS
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF CASH BALANCES, AND ACCRUED
EXPENSES
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity
of these instruments.                    F-17 AG-CHEM EQUIPMENT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
