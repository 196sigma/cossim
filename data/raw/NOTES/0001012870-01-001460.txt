38            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of P-Com, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of P-Com, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in
our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.
These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting associated with revenue recognition effective
January 1, 2000.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
P-Com, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Delaware on August 23, 1991 to
engage in the design, manufacture and marketing of millimeter network access
wave radio systems for use in the worldwide wireless telecommunications market.
The Company also provides network services including system and program
planning and management, path design, and installation for the wireless
communication market through its service sales segment.
Through December 31, 2000, the Company has incurred substantial losses and
negative cash flows from operations and, as of December 31, 2000, the Company
had an accumulated deficit of $2189 million. For the year ended December 31,
2000, the Company recorded losses from operations of $699 million and cash
outflows from operating activities of $370 million.
During 2000, the Company successfully consummated two separate sales of Common
Stock in private placement offerings. The Company sold a total of 7,531,000
shares of Common Stock at a 15% discount to the trailing 60-day average closing
market price for net proceeds of $430 million in January 2000. In August 2000,
the Company sold 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock in a private placement at a
72% discount to the trailing 60-day average closing market price for net
proceeds of $182 million.
The Company operates in a highly competitive market characterized by rapidly
changing technology, together with competitors and distributors that have
significantly greater financial resources than the Company. The Company intends
to incur significant expenses to develop and promote new products as well as to
support existing product sales. Failure to generate sufficient revenues from
new and existing products, raise additional capital or reduce discretionary
expenditures would have a material adverse effect on the Company ability to
continue as a going concern and achieve its intended business objectives.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Management use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates, and such differences could be material and affect the results
of operations reported in future periods.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign currency translation
The functional currencies of the Company foreign subsidiaries are the local
currencies. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into
U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses are included in the results of operations in the
periods incurred, and were not material in all periods presented.
45                  P-Com, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued Fair value of financial instruments
The Company measures its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
estimated fair value of the Company Convertible Subordinated Notes included
in long-term debt was approximately 70% of par or $204 million at December 31,
2000, compared to 74% of par or $217 million at December 31, 1999. The
estimated fair value of cash, accounts receivable and payable, and accrued
liabilities at December 31, 2000 and 1999 approximated cost due to the short
maturity of these assets and liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity when
acquired of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Revenue recognition
Revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon transfer of title and
risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment of the product provided
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or
determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection is probable.
Provisions for estimated warranty repairs, returns and other allowances are
recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Revenue from service sales is
recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the service is performed.
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, based on standard costs
that are updated at least annually. Products and their associated costs are
released from inventory based on first-in, first-out basis.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and include tooling and test
equipment, computer equipment, furniture, land and buildings, and construction-
in-progress. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based upon
the useful lives of the assets ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method based upon the
shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease term of the respective
assets.
Research and development and software development costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The Company software
products are integrated into its hardware products. Software development costs
incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed
as incurred. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility and before general release to
customers are capitalized, if material. To date, all software development costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have been
immaterial.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets of acquired companies accounted for as purchase business
combinations. Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of
expected benefit ranging from 5 to 20 years.
46                  P-Com, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued Impairment of long-lived assets
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of assets may
be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an
evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated
with the asset would be compared to the asset carrying amount to determine if
a write-down is required.
Comprehensive income loss
The Company has adopted SFAS 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Under SFAS
130, the Company is required to display comprehensive income and its components
as part of the Company full set of financial statements. The measurement and
presentation of net income did not change. Comprehensive income comprises net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes
certain changes in equity of the Company that are excluded from net income.
Specifically, SFAS 130 requires unrealized gains and losses on the Company

equity, to be included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Comprehensive
income loss in 2000, 1999 and 1998 has been reflected in the Consolidated
Statement of Stockholders' Equity.
Accounting for stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements using
the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25 and Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 44 Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation FIN 44. Accordingly,
compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
fair value of the Company stock at the date of grant over the stock option
exercise price. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123 and
Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity
Instruments that are offered to other than employees for acquiring or in
conjunction with selling goods or services EITF 96-18. Under SFAS No. 123
and EITF 96-18, stock option awards issued to non-employees are accounted for
at their fair value, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing method.
The fair value of each non-employee stock option or award is remeasured at each
period end until a commitment date is reached, which is generally the vesting
date.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, trade
accounts receivable, and derivative financial instruments used in hedging
activities. The Company places its cash equivalents in a variety of financial
instruments such as market rate accounts and U.S. Government agency debt
securities. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one financial institution or commercial issuer.
To date, the Company has sold most of its products in international markets.
Sales to several customers have been denominated in British pounds and, at
December 31, 2000 and 1999, amounts due from these customers represented 22%
and 28%, respectively, of accounts receivable. Any gains and/or losses incurred
on the settlement of these receivables are included in the financial statements
as they occur.
The Company extends credit terms to international customers of up to 120 days,
which is consistent with local business practices. The Company performs on-
going credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition to determine the
customer credit worthiness. Sales are then generally made either on 30 to 120
day payment terms, COD or letters of credit.

2.Change in Method of Accounting
Effective January 1, 2000, the Company has revised its method of accounting
associated with revenue recognition for sales of equipment as a result of the
adoption of Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101 Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements. The Company previously recognized revenue upon shipment
of product, provided no significant obligations remained and collection was
probable. This method was changed to recognition upon transfer of title and
risk of loss, which is generally upon shipment of the product provided no
significant obligations remained and collection is probable. In accordance with
SAB No. 101, the Company has recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $15
million $15 million, after tax on January 1, 2000 to account for the
cumulative effect of this change in method of accounting.
The cumulative effect of this change in method of accounting primarily resulted
from one contract where revenue had historically been recognized upon shipment,
however, under the terms of the underlying contract, title did not transfer
until subsequent receipt of payment. Under the Company revised revenue
recognition method, revenue relating to such sales is deferred until title
transfers. Primarily as a result of this, approximately $120 million in
revenue and $105 million in related costs originally recognized in 1999 were
deferred and re-recognized in the first quarter of 2000.

4.Borrowing Arrangements
The Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit agreement on May 15, 1998,
as amended, that provided for borrowings of up to $500 million. The maximum
revolving commitment, as amended, had been reduced to $300 million until
maturity on January 15, 2000. At December 31, 1999, the Company had been
advanced approximately $236 million and had used the remaining $34 million to
secure letters of credit under such line. In January 2000, the balance was paid
in full and the line-of-credit agreement was terminated. Borrowings under the
line were secured by the assets of the Company and bore interest at either a
base interest rate or a variable interest rate.
In January 2000 the Company entered into a line-of-credit agreement for $12
million. The line matured and was repaid in full on January 31, 2001 see Note
15. Borrowings under the line bore interest at the greater of prime rate plus
2% 8% per annum at December 31, 2000 and were secured by cash deposits,
receivables, inventory, equipment, investment property and intangibles of the
Company in the United States. In connection with the loan agreement, the
Company issued the lender warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock
at $571 per share. The warrants are fully exercisable, are subject to anti-
dilution clauses and expire on January 31, 2005. The Company recorded a
discount to amounts recorded under the loan agreement of approximately $2
million, which represented the estimated fair value of the warrants. Such
discount was amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan resulting
in $1,745,000 of interest expense in 2000.
On November 5, 1997, the Company issued $100 million in 4 1/4% Convertible
Subordinated Notes the Notes due November 1, 2002. The Notes are
convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company Common
Stock at an initial conversion price of $2746 per share and at $2473 per
share subsequent to October 2000. The Notes are redeemable by the Company,
beginning on November 5, 2000                    50                  P-Com, Inc.

upon 30 days notice, subject to a declining redemption price. Interest on the
Notes is paid semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In 2000, 1999
and 1998, the Company issued Common Stock in exchange for a portion of these
Notes and recorded extraordinary gains as noted below.

5.Capital Stock
The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 145 million shares of
Common Stock, $00001 par value the Common Stock, and 2 million shares of
preferred stock, $00001 par value the Preferred Stock, including 500,000
shares of which have been designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock the Series A pursuant to the Stockholder Rights Agreement see
discussion below.
Preferred Stock
The Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of Preferred Stock in
one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and
restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, dividend rates, conversion
rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation
preferences and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation
of such series, without further vote or action by the holders of Common Stock.
Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock and warrants
In December 1998, the Company completed a private placement of 15,000 shares of
the Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock the Series B for
$1,000 per share and issued mandatorily redeemable warrants to purchase up to
1,242,000 shares of Common Stock at $347 per share. A portion of the proceeds
was allocated to the warrants based on their fair value and accounted for as a
discount to the Series B. The remainder of the proceeds was allocated to the
Series B. Because the Series B was immediately convertible into shares of
Common Stock, the discount was amortized as a reduction of income available to
holders of Common Stock in the amount of $18 million upon the issuance of the
Series B. The Company did not record a beneficial conversion feature related to
Series B because the conversion price, using the conversion terms that are most
beneficial to the holder, was greater than the market price of the Common Stock
on the date of issuance.
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement the Company entered into in
connection with the issuance of the Series B, as amended by the exchange
agreements, the Company was required to register the Series B for resale on or
before July 19, 1999. See additional discussion below regarding premiums and
penalties related to this requirement.
51                  P-Com, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued The mandatorily redeemable warrants issued in connection with Series B were
valued at $1,839,000 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following assumptions used: expected volatility of 65%; a weighted-average
risk-free interest rate of 45% and a weighted-average expected life of 5
years. The initial exercise price for the Common Stock underlying the warrants
was $347.
In June 1999, in connection with the conversion of the Series B to Common
Stock, the mandatorily redeemable warrants were exchanged for 1,242,000 non-
mandatorily redeemable warrants having an exercise price of $300. As a result
of the exchange and repricing of warrants, the Company recorded a $20 million
charge to loss attributable to Common Stockholders representing the difference
in fair value of the warrants before and after the exchange and repricing. The
warrants are immediately exercisable until the earlier of: 1 December 22,
2002, or 2 the date on which the closing of a consolidation, merger of other
business combination with or into another entity pursuant to which the Company
does not survive. In the event the Company merges or consolidates with any
other company, the warrant holders are entitled to similar choices as to the
consideration they will receive in such merger or consolidation as are provided
to the holders of the Series B. In addition, the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of the warrants is subject to an anti-dilution adjustment if the
Company sells Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for
Common Stock excluding certain issuances such as Common Stock issued under
employee, director or consultant benefit plans at a price per share less than
$347 subject to adjustment. These warrants were subsequently exchanged for
Common Warrants as discussed below.
Common Stock
In January 2000, the Company sold approximately 7,531,000 shares of common
stock at a per share price of $571, for an aggregate purchase price of $430
million. The unregistered shares were priced at a 15% discount to the average
closing sale prices of the Company common stock for the 60 consecutive
trading days prior to the signing of the agreement. The shares were
subsequently registered for resale in October 2000. As a result of the late
registration of these shares, the Company was required to issue the holders
warrants to purchase 1,358,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of
$380 per share.
In August 2000, the Company sold 3,000,000 shares of common stock at a per
share price of $611, for an aggregate purchase price of $182 million. The
unregistered shares were priced at a 72% discount to the average closing sale
price of the Company Common Stock for the 60 consecutive trading days prior
to the signing of the agreement. The shares have subsequently been registered
for resale.
In June 1999, the Company received net proceeds of $383 million from the sale
10,068,000 shares of Common Stock sold at a 75% discount from the market
price.
In June 1999, the Company exchanged all 15,000 shares of the Series B for
5,135,000 shares of mandatorily redeemable Common Stock. As a result of this
exchange, the Company recorded a $102 million charge to loss attributable to
Common Stockholders representing the difference between the book value of the
Series B and the market value of the mandatorily redeemable common stock net of
incurred premiums and penalties relating to the non-registration of the Series
B. Upon the occurrence of certain events outside the Company control, each
share of Common Stock was redeemable at the holder option at the greater of
$400 per share or the highest closing price during the period beginning on the
date of the holder notice to redeem to the date on which the Company redeems
the stock. In connection with the exchange agreements, each holder of the
Series B agreed to waive all premiums which had been accrued and penalties
which had been incurred in connection with the Series B as of the date of
exchange. As discussed above, the Company also exchanged outstanding
mandatorily redeemable warrants to purchase 1,243,000 shares of Common Stock,
which were held by the
52                  P-Com, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued
holders of the Series B for new warrants to purchase 1,243,000 shares of Common
Stock with an exercise price of $300 per share rather than $347 per share.
In November 1999, the Company entered into agreements with the holders of the
mandatorily redeemable Common Stock to eliminate their redemption rights and
their past and future late registration premiums and penalties in exchange for
212,000 shares of Common Stock issued on November 16, 1999 at $472 per share,
warrants to purchase 443,000 shares of Common Stock issued on January 20, 2000
at an exercise price of $850 per share, and a $400,000 promissory note
convertible with interest into Common Stock at a conversion price of $472
per share. As a result of this transaction, the Company recorded a $63 million
charge to loss attributable to Common Stockholders representing the difference
between the value of the redemption rights and the market value of the common
stock issued, the fair value of the warrants issued, and the convertible
promissory note net of accrued interest eliminated as part of the transaction.
This note was converted into approximately 95,000 shares of common stock in the
fourth quarter of 2000.
At December 31, 2000, the Company had 10,881 shares of Common Stock reserved
for issuance of warrants and options.

Stockholder Rights Agreement
On September 26, 1997, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a
Stockholder Rights Agreement the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement,
Rights the Rights were distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share
of its Common Stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business
on November 3, 1997. Each Right will entitle stockholders to buy Series A
Preferred at an exercise price of $12500 upon certain events. The Rights will
expire ten years from the date of the Agreement.
In general, the Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company Common Stock or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Company Common Stock. If, after the Rights become exercisable,
the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction,
or sells 50% or more of its assets or earning power, each unexercised Right
will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Right then-current exercise
price, a number of the acquiring Company common shares having a market value
at the time of twice the Right exercise price. At any time within ten days
after the public announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of the Company Common Stock, the Board, in its sole
discretion, may redeem the Rights for $00001 per Right. In the case of the
State of Wisconsin Investment Board and Firsthand Capital Management, the
threshold figure is 20% rather than 15%.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued 6.Employee Benefit Plans
Stock Option Plans. On January 11, 1995, the Company Board of Directors
adopted the 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan the 1995 Plan as a
successor to its 1992 Stock Option Plan the 1992 Plan. As of January 11,
1995, no further option grants or stock issuances were made under the 1992
Plan, and all option grants and stock issuances made during the remainder of
1995 were made under the 1995 Plan. All outstanding options under the 1992 Plan
were incorporated into the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan authorizes the issuance of
up to 14,934,459 shares of Common Stock as of December 31, 2000.
Options granted under the 1992 Plan are generally exercisable for a period not
to exceed ten years, and generally must be issued with exercise prices not less
than 100% and 85%, for incentive and non-qualified stock options, respectively,
of the estimated fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant as
determined by the Board of Directors. Options granted under the 1992 Plan are
exercisable immediately upon grant and generally vest 25% on the first
anniversary from the date of grant, and ratably each month over the remaining
thirty-six month period. Unvested shares purchased through the exercise of
stock options are subject to repurchase by the Company.
The 1995 Plan contains three equity incentive programs: a Discretionary Option
Grant Program, a Stock Issuance Program for officers and employees of the
Company and independent consultants and advisors to the Company and an
Automatic Option Grant Program for non-employee members of the Company Board
of Directors.
Options under the Discretionary Option Grant Program may be granted at not less
than 100% of the fair market value per share of common stock on the grant date
with exercise periods not to exceed ten years. The plan administrator is
authorized to issue tandem stock appreciation rights and limited stock
appreciation rights in connection with the option grants.
The Stock Issuance Program provides for the sale of common stock at a price not
less than 100% of fair market value. Shares may also be issued solely for
services. The administrator has discretion as to vesting provisions, including
accelerations, and may institute a loan program to assist participants with
financing stock purchases. The program also provides certain alternatives to
satisfy tax liabilities incurred by participants in connection with the
program.
Under the Automatic Option Grant Program, as amended, participants will
automatically receive an option to purchase 40,000 shares of common stock upon
initially joining the Board of Directors and will receive an additional
automatic grant each year at each annual stockholders' meeting for 4,000
shares. Each option will have an exercise price per share equal to 100% of the
fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The shares subject to
the initial share option vest, and for options granted before November 2000 the
shares subject to the annual 4,000 share option will vest, in eight successive
equal quarterly installments upon the optionee completion of each successive
3-month period of Board service over the 24-month period measured from the
grant date. Effective November 2000, the annual 4,000 share options will vest
fully on the grant date.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On January 11, 1995, the Company Board of
Directors adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, which
was approved by stockholders in February 1995. The Purchase Plan permits
eligible employees to purchase Common Stock at a discount through payroll
deductions during successive offering periods with a maximum duration of 24
months. Each offering period shall be divided into consecutive semi-annual
purchase periods. The price at which the Common Stock is purchased under the
Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on
the first day of the offering period or the last day of the purchase period,
whichever is lower. A total of 1,150,000 shares of Common Stock have been
reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan, as amended at the May 1997 and
1998 Annual Meetings of Stockholders. Awards and terms are established by the
Company Board of Directors. The Purchase Plan may be canceled at any time at
the discretion of the Company Board of Directors prior to its expiration in
December 2004. Under the Plan, the Company sold approximately 392,000, 211,000,
and 240,000 shares in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Because the Company has adopted the disclosure-only provision of SFAS No. 123,
no compensation expense has been recognized for its stock option plan or for
its stock purchase plan. Had compensation costs for the Company two stock-
based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant
dates for

the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for
grants in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively: expected volatility of 95%, 96 and 72%; weighted-average risk-free interest rates of 62%, 54%, and 51 weighted-average expected lives of 371, 328, and 276, respectively, and a
zero dividend yield.
The fair value of the employees' stock purchase rights was estimated using the
Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively: expected volatility of 95%, 96%, and 72% weighted-average risk-
free interest rates of 62%, 46%, and 53%, weighted-average expected lives of
05, 05, and 05 years and a dividend yield of zero. The weighted-average fair
value of those purchase rights granted in 2000, 1999, and 1998 was $603 574, and $199, respectively.
401k Plan
The Company sponsors a 401k Plan the 401k Plan which provides tax-
deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. Employees may contribute up
to 15% of their annual compensation to the 401k Plan, limited to a maximum
annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The 401k
Plan permits, but does not require, the Company to make matching contributions.
To date, no matching contributions have been made.
7.Restructuring and Other Charges
In the second quarter of 2000, the Company determined that there was a need to
reevaluate its inventory levels and related accrued liabilities in light of
recent changes in product and customer mix. The evaluation was prompted by a
change in customer mix away from the UK and other European markets and toward
the U.S. market, and the resulting anticipated decrease in demand for certain
of its lower speed and lower frequency Tel-Link Point-to-Point product line,
and resulted in total charges of approximately $217 million during the second
quarter of 2000. These charges consisted of increases to inventory reserve of
approximately $174 million and accrued liabilities of approximately $43
million, both relating to the Company product segment. In addition, the
Company performed a review of the carrying value and remaining life of long-
lived assets associated with the Company product segment and recorded write-
downs of approximately $150 million of goodwill, and an approximately $99
million write-off of deferred tax assets.
The increase in inventory reserves and related purchases liabilities was
charged to product cost of sales in the second quarter of 2000. Of the $17
million charge for additional reserves, $154 million related to the Tel-Link
Point-to-Point product line. An additional reserve of approximately $10
million was added in the second quarter to adjust carrying value of certain
modules of the Point-to-Multipoint radio line.
56                  P-Com, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued During 1999 and 1998, the Company management approved restructuring plans,
which included initiatives to integrate the operations of acquired companies,
consolidate duplicate facilities, and reduce overhead. Total accrued
restructuring and other charges of approximately $365 million and
approximately $266 million were recorded in 1999 and 1998, respectively,
relating to these initiatives, all relating to the Company product segment.
As of December 31, 1999, the Company had utilized all restructuring reserves
established to offset actual restructuring costs incurred by the Company.
8.Segment Reporting
For purposes of segment reporting, the Company aggregates operating segments
that have similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria
specified in SFAS No. 131. The Company has determined that there are two
reportable segments: Product Sales and Service Sales. The Product Sales segment
consists of organizations located primarily in the United States, the United
Kingdom, and Italy, which develop, manufacture, and/or market network access
systems for use in the worldwide wireless telecommunications market. The
Service Sales segment consists of organizations primarily located in the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Italy, which provide comprehensive network
services including system and program planning and management, path design, and
installation for the wireless communications market.
In August 1999, the Company announced its intent to divest its broadcast
equipment business, Technosystem, and concluded that a measurement date had
occurred. Accordingly, beginning in the third quarter of 1999, this business
was reported as a discontinued operation and the amounts presented for prior
periods have been reclassified for appropriate comparability. Technosystem was
divested in the first quarter of 2000. As such, the segment information shown
below does not include Technosystem financial information. Capital
expenditures for long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment
and are excluded as presenting such information is not practical. The following

9.Net Loss Per Share
For purpose of computing diluted net loss per share, weighted average common
share equivalents do not include stock options with an exercise price that
exceeds the average fair market value of the Company Common Stock for the
period because the effect would be antidilutive. Because losses were incurred
in the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, all options, warrants, and convertible notes
are excluded from the computations of diluted net loss per share because they
are antidilutive.

The Company net operating loss carryforwards included as a deferred tax asset
above are approximately $148 million and $86 million for 2000 and 1999,
respectively. These operating loss carryforwards will expire between 2005 and
2020 if not utilized beforehand.
For federal and state tax purposes, a portion of the Company net operating
loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations on utilization in case
of change in ownership as defined by federal and state tax law.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of
differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their bases for
financial reporting purposes. In addition, future tax benefits, such as net
operating loss carryforwards, are recognized to the extent that realization of
such benefits is more likely than not. During 2000, the Company reassessed its
ability to realize future tax benefits, and concluded that as a result of the
recent history of losses, it was more likely than not, that such benefits would
not be realized. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of approximately
$99 million in 2000 to establish a full valuation allowance against its
deferred tax assets.

On February 24, 1997, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of
Technosystem, for aggregate payments of $33 million and the assumption of
long-term debt of approximately $127 million in addition to other liabilities.
The Company initially paid $26 million in cash, and an additional payment of
$07 million was made on March 31, 1998, which was subject to certain
indemnification obligations of the former Technosystem security holders, as set
forth in the securities purchase agreement. Technosystem designs, manufactures
and markets equipment for transmitters and transponders for television and
radio broadcasting. In 1999 the Company announced its intention to dispose of
Technosystem.
On March 7, 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of

located in Herndon, Virginia, supply, install and maintain telecommunications
systems and structure including antennas covering high frequency, medium
frequency and microwave systems.
The Company accounted for its acquisitions of CRC, RT Masts and Telematics as
poolings-of-interests and, therefore, all prior period financial statements
presented include the results of these acquired companies as if they had been
combined since inception.
In February 2000, the Company completed the divestiture of two Italian
subsidiaries, Technosystem, S.p.A. and Cemetal S.r.L. resulting in additional
losses for the first quarter of approximately $40 million and $35 million,
respectively.
In April 2000, the Company sold Control Resources Corporation CRC resulting
in a gain of approximately $26 million.
Discontinued Operation
In August 1999, the Company Board of Directors decided to divest its
broadcast equipment business, Technosystem. Accordingly, beginning in the third
quarter of 1999, this business is reported as a discontinued operation and the
financial statement information related to this business has been presented on
one line in the 1999 Consolidated Balance Sheet, net assets of discontinued
operations, and in the discontinued operations line of the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for 2000 and 1999. The net assets of discontinued
operations represents the assets intended to be sold offset by the liabilities
anticipated to be assumed by the buyers of the business. The Statements of
Operations amounts related to Technosystem in prior periods have been
reclassified to discontinued operations.

In September and October 1998, several class action complaints were filed in
the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, on behalf of P-Com
stockholders who purchased or otherwise acquired its Common Stock between April
1997 and September 11, 1998. The plaintiffs allege various state securities
laws violations by P-Com and certain of its officers and directors. The
complaints seek un-quantified compensatory, punitive and other damages,
attorneys' fees and injunctive and/or equitable relief.
On December 3, 1998, the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara,
entered an order consolidating all of the above complaints. On June 30, 2000
the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, issued a notice of
ruling certifying this matter as a class action.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -- Continued Although the litigation is being conducted actively, it is still at an early
stage and the Company is unable to speculate as to ultimate outcomes. An
unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Even if all of the
litigation is resolved in our favor, the defense of such litigation may entail
considerable cost and the significant diversion of efforts of management.
