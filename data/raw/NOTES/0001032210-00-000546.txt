ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Onyx Software Corporation
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Onyx
Software Corporation as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Onyx Software
Corporation at December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES
Description of the Company
Onyx Software and subsidiaries Company provides enterprise-wide, customer-
centric e-business solutions. Using the Internet in combination with
traditional forms of interaction, including phone, mail, fax and email
solutions, the Company solution enables enterprises to more effectively
acquire, manage and retain customers, partners and other relationships. The
Company designed its solution for companies that want to merge new e-business
processes with traditional business processes to enhance their customer-facing
operations. The Company software applications use a single data model across
all customer interactions, resulting in a single repository for all marketing,
sales and service information. The Company was incorporated in the State of
Washington on February 23, 1994 and maintains its headquarters in Bellevue,
Washington.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Changes
in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the financial
statements. The Company has used estimates in determining certain provisions,
including uncollectible trade accounts receivable, useful lives for fixed
assets and intangibles, and tax liabilities.
Revenue Recognition
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, was
issued in October 1997 by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and was amended by Statement of Position 98-4 SOP 98-4. The
Company adopted SOP 97-2 effective January 1, 1998. The AICPA issued SOP 98-9,
which provides certain amendments to SOP 97-2, which is effective for
transactions entered into beginning January 1, 2000. This pronouncement may
require more revenue to be deferred for certain types of transactions.
The Company generates revenues through two sources: 1 software license
revenues and 2 service revenues. Software license revenues are generated from
licensing the rights to use the Company products directly to end-users and
indirectly through sublicense fees from resellers and, to a lesser extent,
through third-party products the Company distributes. Service revenues are
generated from sales of customer support services, consulting and training
services performed for customers that license the Company products.
Revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of
software if persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, collection is
probable, the fee is fixed or determinable, and vendor-specific objective
evidence exists to allocate the total fee to elements of the arrangement.
Vendor-specific objective evidence is typically based on the price charged when
an element is sold separately, or, in the case of an element not yet sold
separately, the price established by authorized management, if it is probable
that the price, once established, will not change before market introduction.
Elements included in multiple element arrangements could consist of software
products, upgrades, enhancements, customer support services, or consulting
services. If an acceptance period is required, revenues are recognized upon the
earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period. The
Company agreements with its customers and resellers do not contain product
return rights.
39              ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Revenues from customer support services are recognized ratably over the term
of the contract, typically one year. Consulting revenues are primarily related
to implementation services performed on a time-and-materials basis under
separate service arrangements related to the installation of the Company
software products. Revenues from consulting and training services are
recognized as services are performed. If a transaction includes both license
and service elements, license fee revenues are recognized on shipment of the
software, provided services do not include significant customization or
modification of the base product, and the payment terms for licenses are not
subject to acceptance criteria. In cases where license fee payments are
contingent on the acceptance of services, the Company defers recognition of
revenues from both the license and the service elements until the acceptance
criteria are met.
Cash Equivalents, Short-term Marketable Securities and Long-term Marketable
Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The Company cash equivalents consist of banker acceptances
with a maturity of three months or less and money market funds. Short-term
marketable securities generally consist of highly liquid debt securities which
mature within one year of the balance sheet date. Long-term marketable
securities generally consist of highly liquid debt securities with remaining
maturities in excess of one year.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
At December 31, 1999, the Company has the following financial instruments:
cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts
receivable, long-term marketable securities, accounts payable, accrued
liabilities, capital lease obligations and long-term debt. The carrying value
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximates their fair value based on the liquidity of these
financial instruments or based on their short-term nature. The Company has
classified its short-term and long-term marketable securities as available-
for-sale. Such investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and
losses, net of related tax effects, reported within accumulated other
comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities are computed using the specific identification method. The carrying
value of capital lease obligations and long-term debt approximates fair value
based on the market interest rates available to the Company for debt of similar
risk and maturities.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets or over the lease term if it
is shorter for leasehold improvements, which range from two to seven years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or
estimated useful life.
Purchased Technology and Intangibles
Purchased technology represents software source code and software licenses
acquired from third parties. Amortization of purchased technology is provided
on a product-by-product basis over the estimated economic life of the software,
generally two to five years, using the straight-line method. Unamortized
capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a
product are expensed at the date of such determination.
Intangibles represent the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and is amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated lives of two to five years. The
carrying value of goodwill is reviewed periodically. In the event that the sum
of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the recorded book
value, the carrying value will be reduced to its fair value.
40              ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Research and Development
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software
development costs, are expensed as incurred. Financial accounting standards
provide for the capitalization of certain software development costs after
technological feasibility of the software is established. Under the Company
current practice of developing new products and enhancements, the technological
feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially
all product development is complete, including the development of a working
model. No such costs have been capitalized because the impact of capitalizing
such costs would not be material.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Major Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The
Company customer base is dispersed across many different geographic areas
throughout North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America and consists
of companies in a variety of industries. During 1997, 1998 and 1999, no single
customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenues. The Company does not
require collateral or other security to support credit sales, but provides an
allowance for bad debts based on historical experience and specifically
identified risks.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of the Company foreign subsidiaries is the local
currency in the country in which the subsidiary is located. Assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at
the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses
are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The
translation adjustment resulting from this process is shown within accumulated
other comprehensive income loss as a component of shareholders' equity. Gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated
statement of operations as incurred. To date, gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions have not been significant.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under the
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No. 25, and related
interpretations, in accounting for employee stock options rather than the
alternative fair value accounting allowed by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No. 123.
Under APB No. 25, compensation expense related to the Company employee stock
options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option. SFAS No.
123 requires companies that continue to follow APB No. 25 to provide pro forma
disclosure of the impact of applying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123. The
Company recognizes compensation expense for options granted to non-employees in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and the Emerging Issues Task
Force consensus Issue 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued
to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services, which require using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and
remeasuring such stock options to the current fair market value until the
performance date has been reached.
Deferred stock-based compensation consists of amounts recorded when the
exercise price of an option or the sales price of restricted stock was lower
than the subsequently determined deemed fair value for financial reporting
purposes. Deferred stock-based compensation is amortized over the vesting
period of the underlying options.
41              ONYX SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as the related promotional materials are
released. Advertising expense was $16 million, $21 million and $41 million
during the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Earnings Per Share and Pro Forma Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss available
to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential
dilution of securities by including other common stock equivalents, including
stock options and redeemable convertible preferred stock, in the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding for a period, if dilutive.
Pro forma earnings per share is computed by dividing net income loss by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted
average redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as if such shares
were converted into common stock at the time of issuance.
Other Comprehensive Income
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income,
which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income
and its components in the financial statements. The only items of other
comprehensive income loss which the Company currently reports are foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains losses on marketable
securities.
Business Segments
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes standards for reporting
information about operating segments in annual financial statements. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. Information related to segment
disclosures is contained in Note 13.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and
Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives, and for hedging
activities. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning January 1,
2001. Because the Company has never used nor currently intends to use
derivatives, management does not anticipate that the adoption of this new
standard will have a significant effect on earnings or the financial position
of the Company.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101. This summarizes certain areas of the
Staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 2. ACQUISITIONS
EnCyc, Inc.
In September 1998, the Company acquired EnCyc, Inc. EnCyc, a privately
held marketing encyclopedia software developer. In exchange for all the
outstanding shares of EnCyc, the Company issued 466,666 shares of its common
stock, paid $500,000 to EnCyc shareholders, and liquidated $250,000 of EnCyc
existing long-term debt. In addition, in connection with the acquisition, the
Company issued options to EnCyc employees to purchase up to 150,000 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $250 per share. These options have been
treated as part of the purchase price, resulting in a total purchase price of
$24 million, including direct costs of the acquisition. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the
results of EnCyc operations are included in the Company consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition.
Versametrix Corporation
On August 2, 1999, the Company acquired Versametrix Corporation, a privately
held developer of a comprehensive, browser-based personalization framework and
a Web-based business intelligence solution. In exchange for all the outstanding
shares of Versametrix, the Company issued 192,386 shares of Onyx Common Stock
valued at $1,554,000 and assumed $62,000 of Versametrix debt, which was
immediately liquidated. As a result of the acquisition, $100,000 of recent
royalty advances to Versametrix was capitalized and accounted for as part of
the purchase price.
Including direct costs of the acquisition, the total purchase price was
approximately $18 million. The transaction was accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the results of Versametrix
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date of acquisition. The Company recorded capitalized technology and other
intangible assets of $19 million, which will be amortized on a straight-line
basis over their expected lives of three to five years.
Market Solutions Limited
On October 1, 1999, the Company acquired Market Solutions Limited, a
corporation formed under the laws of England. Market Solutions, a privately
held company established in 1989, is a provider of Web-based customer
relationship management systems in the United Kingdom. The Company paid $50
million in cash and issued 132,048 shares of common stock valued at $10
million in exchange for all the outstanding capital stock of Market Solutions.
The Company is also obligated to issue up to an additional $36 million in
common stock on October 1, 2000 and up to an additional $432 million in common
stock on October 1, 2001, depending on Market Solutions' attainment of certain
revenue and profitability targets in each of the next two years. The number of
shares of common stock will be determined based on the trading prices of the
Company common stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the three trading days
immediately prior to issuance. Such additional consideration, if any, would be
considered additional purchase price related to goodwill and amortized over the
remaining expected useful life.
At the date of acquisition, the total purchase price, including direct costs
associated with the acquisition, was approximately $74 million. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and,
accordingly, the results of Market Solutions operations have been included in
the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company
recorded capitalized technology and other intangible assets of $107 million,
which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a two and one-half to
five-year period following the acquisition. This represents the expected life
of the intangible assets that the Company acquired.

To determine the value of the developed technology, the expected future cash
flows of the existing technology products were discounted, taking into account
risks related to the characteristics and applications of each product, existing
and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of each product.
Based on this analysis, the existing technology that had reached technological
feasibility was capitalized. Amounts allocated to in-process research and
development were immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because
technological feasibility was not established and no alternative commercial use
was identified. Amounts attributable to purchased technology, goodwill and
other intangibles will be amortized over their estimated useful life of two and
one-half to five years on a straight-line basis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 6. LINE OF CREDIT
Accounts Receivable Line of Credit
In August 1998, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement with
Silicon Valley Bank. The agreement allows the Company to borrow up to $80
million, with maximum borrowings not to exceed 80% of eligible receivables as
defined by the agreement. Interest on borrowings is, at the Company
discretion, at the lender prime rate or LIBOR plus 20% 850% at December

financial covenants, and the agreement restricts the payment of dividends. The
line of credit agreement expires in June 2000. As of December 31, 1999, the
Company had no outstanding borrowings under the working capital facility;
however, there was approximately $778,000 in standby letters of credit
outstanding in connection with facility lease commitments, which reduces the
amount available under this credit facility.
Equipment Term Loan Facility
In August 1998, the Company entered into an agreement with Silicon Valley
Bank providing a $30 million term loan facility, with maximum borrowings not
to exceed invoice amounts for equipment purchased after June 1, 1998, for the
purpose of financing new capital equipment purchases. Interest on borrowings is
at the lender prime rate plus 025% 875% at December 31, 1999. The
facility provided for a twelve-month advance period with monthly payments of
interest only, followed by 36 monthly payments of principal plus interest.
Among other provisions, the Company is required to maintain certain financial
covenants, and the agreement restricts the payment of dividends. The equipment
term loan facility expires in August 2002. At December 31, 1999, the Company
had borrowed $63,000 under this credit facility.
Both credit facilities are cross-collateralized by liens against accounts
receivable and specific assets financed by the lender, with a negative pledge
on other assets. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of
the credit facilities at December 31, 1999.
Other Current Debt Obligations
At December 31, 1999, other current debt obligations totaled $123,000,

In March 1996, the Company completed a $30 million private placement of
4,348,164 shares of Series A Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock
Series A at $069 per share. Net proceeds from the financing amounted to
$2,977,000. Each share of Series A converted into common stock upon the
closing of the initial public offering. Holders of Series A had preferential
rights over common shareholders to dividends of $0069 10% per share per
annum, when and if declared, and were entitled to the number of votes equal to
the number of shares of common stock into which their stock could be
converted. The Company was not allowed to carry out certain events, as
specified in the Articles of Incorporation, without the advance consent of the
majority of the preferred shareholders, as specified in the Articles of
Incorporation. In the event of liquidation, the holders of Series A had
preferential rights over common shareholders to liquidation payments at the
original purchase price, plus declared but unpaid dividends. The Company never
declared any Series A dividends.
Series B Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
In March 1997, the Company completed an $80 million private placement of
2,519,686 shares of Series B Convertible and Redeemable Preferred Stock
Series B at $318 per share. Net proceeds from the financing amounted to
$7,945,000. In conjunction with the sales of Series B, the Company entered
into amended Investors' Rights, Voting, and Co-Sale, and Right of First Offer
Agreements. Each share of Series B was converted into common stock upon the
closing of the initial public offering. In December 1998, the Board of
Directors authorized a 200,000 share increase in the number of shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Stock, effectively increasing the conversion ratio from one-to-one
to 1079-to-one. The fair value of the 200,000 share increase in the number of
shares of common stock issuable upon a conversion of the Series B Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Stock was accounted for as a deemed dividend at $650
per share based on the price of stock issued in the initial public offering,
and has been reflected within preferred stock accretion in the statement of
operations. Under the terms of the agreement, Series B shareholders had rights
in preference to, but otherwise similar to those of, Series A shareholders,
including dividends of $0318 10% per share per annum, when and if declared.
The Company never declared any Series B dividends.
9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Initial Public Offering
On February 12, 1999, the Company completed an initial public offering of
7,130,000 shares of common stock, including 930,000 shares pursuant to the
underwriters' exercise of their overallotment option, as adjusted to reflect
the 2-for-1 split of the common stock effected March 1, 2000. The offered
shares generated net proceeds to the Company of approximately $419 million.
Concurrent with the offering, all 6,867,850 shares of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
the Company redeemable convertible preferred stock automatically converted
into 7,067,850 shares of common stock.
Shareholder Rights Plan
On October 22, 1999, the Company Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder
Rights Plan the Rights Plan in which preferred stock purchase rights Rights
were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of
Common Stock held as of the close of business on November 9, 1999. The Company
adopted the plan to guard against partial tender offers and other abusive
tactics that might be used in an attempt to gain control of the Company without
paying all shareholders a fair price for their shares. The Rights Plan, which
expires on November 9, 2009, will not prevent takeovers, but it is designed to
deter coercive takeover tactics and to encourage anyone attempting to acquire
the Company to first negotiate with the Board.
Each Right will entitle each shareholder to buy one one-hundredth of a newly
issued share of Series A Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock of the
Company at an exercise price of $6000 per one one-hundredth of a preferred
share. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group, other than an
exempted person, makes a tender offer for, or acquires beneficial ownership, of
15% or more of the Company then outstanding Common Stock.
If any person other than an exempted person becomes the beneficial owner of
15% or more of the Company outstanding Common Stock, then each Right not
owned by such person or certain related parties will entitle its holder to
purchase, at the Right then current exercise price, shares of the Company
Common Stock or, in certain circumstances, cash, property or other securities
of the Company having a market value equal to twice the then current exercise
price. In addition, if, after a person becomes the beneficial owner of 15% or
more of the Company outstanding Common Stock, the Company is acquired in a
merger or other business combination transaction, or sells 50% or more of its
assets or earning power to another person, each Right will entitle its holder
to purchase, at the Right then current exercise price, shares of Common Stock
of such other person having a market value equal to twice the then current
exercise price.
The Company Board of Directors will generally be entitled to redeem the
Rights at $01 per Right at any time prior to a person or group acquiring 15%
or more of the Company Common Stock.
Notes Receivable from Officers
In July 1998, certain officers exercised options to purchase 2,600,000
shares of common stock and paid the exercise price by issuing promissory notes
to the Company totaling $212,000. These notes, which have been offset against
common stock for financial statement presentation, are due in July 2001 and
bear interest at 539%, payable annually. These notes and the interest thereon
are full recourse.
1994 Combined Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option Plan
Under the terms of the 1994 Combined Incentive and Nonqualified Stock Option
Plan the 1994 option plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive and
nonqualified stock options to employees, officers, directors, agents,
consultants, and independent contractors of the Company. There were 10,000,000
shares of common stock reserved under the 1994 option plan. Generally, the
Company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, as determined by the Company
Board of Directors. Options generally vest over a four and one-half year
period; 25% vest after 18 months, with 125% vesting every six months
thereafter. In December 1997, the Board of Directors made a special grant of
283,200 options to certain key employees that vest 167% after 18 months, and
an additional 167% at the end of each month thereafter, with the result that
100% of the options are vested six and one-half years from the date of grant.
Options generally expire ten years from the date of grant. In October 1998, the
Board of Directors suspended the 1994 option plan and determined that no
further grants shall be made pursuant to the 1994 option plan see 1998 Stock
Incentive Compensation Plan.

In October 1998, the Board of Directors adopted the 1998 Stock Incentive
Compensation Plan the 1998 option plan, which was approved by the Company
shareholders in November 1998. The 1998 option plan provides for both stock
options and restricted stock awards to employees, officers, directors, agents,
advisors, consultants and independent contractors of the Company. There were
3,000,000 shares of common stock reserved under the 1998 option plan and the
plan provides that any options cancelled and returned to the 1994 option plan
shall become available for future grant under the 1998 option plan. The 1998
option plan provides for an annual increase to be added on the first day of
each fiscal year beginning in 2000 equal to the lesser of a 3,351,526 shares,
or b 5% of the average common shares outstanding used to calculate fully

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In December 1998, the Board of Directors and shareholders approved the 1998
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which was implemented upon the
effectiveness of the initial public offering in February 1999. The ESPP permits
eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation. Under the ESPP,
no employee may purchase common stock worth more than $25,000 in any calendar
year, valued as of the first day of each offering period. In addition, owners
of 5% or more of the Company or a subsidiary common stock may not
participate in the ESPP. The Company authorized the issuance under the ESPP of
a total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, plus an automatic annual increase,
to be added on the first day of the fiscal year beginning in 2000, equal to the
lesser of a 400,000 shares, b 12% of the average common shares outstanding
as used to calculate fully diluted earnings per share as reported in the Annual
Report for the preceding year, or c a lesser amount determined by the Board
of Directors. Accordingly, on January 1, 2000, the ESPP pool will be increased
by 374,592 shares. Any shares from increases in previous years that are not
actually issued shall be added to the aggregate number of shares available for
issuance under the ESPP.
The ESPP provides for six-month offering periods. The first offering period
commenced on the effectiveness of the initial public offering in February 1999
and ended June 30, 1999. Subsequent offering periods begin on each January 1
and July 1. The price of the common stock purchased under the ESPP will be the
lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the first day of an offering period
and 85% of the fair market value on the last day of an offering period, except
that the purchase price for the first offering period was equal to the lesser
of 100% of the initial public offering price of the common stock and 85% of the
fair market value on June 30, 1999. The ESPP does not have a fixed expiration
date, but the Company Board of Directors may terminate it at any time.
During 1999, 124,798 shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP.
At December 31, 1999, the Company had a total of 875,202 shares of common stock
reserved for future issuance under its ESPP.
Pro Forma Disclosure Under SFAS No. 123
Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of the Company employee stock
options generally equals the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Deferred compensation expense of
$215,000 and $2,153,000 was recorded during 1997 and 1998, respectively, for
those situations where the exercise price of an option was lower than the
deemed fair value for financial reporting purposes of the underlying common
stock. No deferred compensation expense was recorded in 1999. The deferred
compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the underlying
options. Amortization of the deferred stock-based compensation balance of
$903,000 at December 31, 1999 will approximate $489,000, $270,000 and $144,000
for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

grants made prior to 1995.

At December 31, 1999, the Company had a domestic net operating loss,
research and development and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $52 million 675,000 and $337,000, respectively, which begin to expire in 2017. Utilization
of these carryforwards depends on the recognition of future taxable income. The
Company ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in
the event that a change in ownership, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code,
occurs in the future. To the extent that any single-year loss is not utilized
to the full amount of the limitation, such unused loss is carried forward to
subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the expiration of the
relevant carryforward period.

between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components

assets increased decreased by $22 million and $96,000 during the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
