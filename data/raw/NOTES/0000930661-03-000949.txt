NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A
SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES Nature of Operations ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries collectively, the Company or ONEOK is a diversified energy
company engaged in the production, processing, gathering, storage, transportation, distribution, and marketing of natural gas, electricity and natural gas liquids. The Company manages its business in six segments: Marketing and Trading, Gathering
and Processing, Transportation and Storage, Distribution, Production and Other. The Marketing and Trading segment markets natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and markets electricity to wholesale customers. The Company owns and operates gas processing plants, as well as gathering pipelines in Oklahoma,
Kansas and Texas through its Gathering and Processing segment. The Transportation and Storage segment owns and leases natural gas storage facilities and transports gas in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The Companys Distribution segment provides
natural gas distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas through its divisions Oklahoma Natural Gas Company ONG and Kansas Gas Service Company KGS, respectively. The Production segment produces natural gas and oil and owns natural gas and oil
reserves. The Companys Other segment, whose results of operations are not material, operates and leases the Companys headquarters building and parking facility. Critical Accounting Policies Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities The Company engages in price risk management activities for both
trading and non-trading purposes. On January 1, 2000, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities EITF 98-10 for its energy trading contracts. EITF 98-10
requires entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading contracts using mark-to-market accounting. The adoption of EITF 98-10 was accounted for as a change in accounting principle and the cumulative effect at January 1,
2000 of $21 million, net of tax, was recognized. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities
in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the
impact of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in energy trading revenues, in the consolidated statements of income. Market prices used to determine fair value of these assets and liabilities reflect managements best estimate
considering various factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a
reasonable period of time under present market conditions. During the third quarter of 2002, the Company adopted the applicable provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities EITF 02-3. EITF 02-3 provides that all mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading contracts should be presented on a net basis energy contract sales less energy contract
costs in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The historical financial results of all energy trading
contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02-3. Energy trading revenues include natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between two trading
locations relative to the Henry Hub price. In October 2002, the
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities Statement 133, will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the
rescission of this statement, the EITF also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value, but should be carried at the lower of cost or market. The rescission is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 31,
2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002, and will be applied in periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October
25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, the Company estimates this will
result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $1410 million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash and may be recovered in energy trading 
61 Table of Contents
operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be included
in the March 31, 2003 financial statements. For further discussion, see Note D. Regulation The Companys intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission OCC, Kansas Corporation
Commission KCC and Texas Railroad Commission TRC. Certain other transportation activities of the Company are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC. ONG, KGS and portions of the Transportation and Storage
segment follow the accounting and reporting guidance contained in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation Statement 71. Allocation of costs and revenues to
accounting periods for rate-making and regulatory purposes may differ from bases generally applied by non-regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered to be generally accepted accounting principles
for regulated utilities, provided that there is a demonstrable ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates. During the rate-making process, regulatory commissions may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time
as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and
amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. Total regulatory assets resulting from this deferral process are approximately $2180 million and $2353 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although no further unbundling of
services is anticipated, should this occur, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for following Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. However, the Company does not
anticipate that these costs, if any, will be significant. See Note E. KGS was subject to a three-year rate moratorium, which was set to expire in November 2000. As a result of implementing a weather normalization mechanism in Kansas, KGS agreed to a two-year extension of the rate moratorium. The
extended rate moratorium expired in late November 2002 and KGS filed a rate case with the KCC on January 31, 2003. KGS expects the regulatory approval process to take approximately eight months. Until a final order is received, KGS will operate
under the current rate schedule. ONG is not subject to a rate moratorium. Impairments The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount. The impairment
loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows or information provided by sales and purchases of similar assets. The Company evaluates impairment of assets on
the lowest possible level. Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of ONEOK, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 20 percent to 50 percent-owned affiliates are accounted
for on the equity method. Investments in less than twenty percent owned affiliates are accounted for on the cost method. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have original
maturities of three months or less. Inventories 
Materials and supplies are valued at average cost. Noncurrent gas in storage is classified as property and is valued at cost. The Marketing and Trading segments gas in storage, which is recorded in current price risk management assets, is
carried at fair value. Cost of current gas in storage for ONG is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO methodology. The estimated replacement cost of current gas in storage valued under the LIFO method was $25 million and $13 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, compared to its value under the LIFO method of $23 million and $30 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Current gas in storage for all other companies is determined using the weighted
average cost of gas method. Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities To minimize the risk from fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil, the Companys non-trading segments periodically enter into futures transactions, swaps, and options in order to hedge anticipated
sales of natural gas and crude oil production, fuel requirements and inventories in its natural gas liquids business. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk. 
62 Table of Contents
Prior to 2001, in order to
qualify as a hedge, the price movements in the underlying commodity derivatives had to be sufficiently correlated with the hedged transaction. Gains and losses from hedging transactions were recognized in income and reflected as cash flows from
operating activities in the periods for which the underlying commodity or interest rate transactions were hedged. If the necessary correlation to the commodity or interest rate transaction being hedged was not maintained, the Company ceased to
account for the contract as a hedge and recognized a gain or loss in current earnings to the extent the contract results had not been offset by the effects of the price or interest rate changes on the hedged item. If the underlying commodity or
interest rate transaction being hedged by the derivative was disposed of or otherwise terminated, the gain or loss associated with such derivatives was no longer deferred and was recognized in the period the underlying was eliminated. On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement 133,
amended by Statement No. 137 and Statement No. 138. Statement 137 delayed the implementation of Statement 133 until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Statement 138 amended the accounting and reporting standards of Statement 133 for certain
derivative instruments and hedging activities. Statement 138 also amends Statement 133 for decisions made by the FASB relating to the Derivatives Implementation Group DIG process. Under Statement 133, entities are required to record all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding it. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect
to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values, cash flows, or foreign currencies. If the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in
the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income outside earnings and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, as well
as the ineffective portion of the hedge, are reported in earnings immediately. See Note D. Regulated Property Regulated properties are stated at cost, which includes an allowance for funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction represents the
capitalization of the estimated average cost of borrowed funds 64 percent and 60 percent in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively used during the construction of major projects and is recorded as a credit to interest expense. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon rates
prescribed for ratemaking purposes. The average depreciation rate for property that is regulated by the OCC approximated 30 percent, 29 percent and 30 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average depreciation rates for
properties regulated by the KCC, excluding Mid-Continent Market Center MCMC, were approximately 34 percent, 34 percent and 33 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average depreciation rates for MCMC properties were 36
percent, 34 percent and 33 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense. Generally, the cost of property retired or sold, plus removal costs, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Gains and losses from sales or transfers of
operating units or systems are recognized in income. The
following table sets forth the remaining life and service years of the Companys regulated properties.  Remaining Life

Production
Property The Company uses the successful-efforts method to account for costs incurred in the acquisition and development of natural gas and oil reserves. Costs to acquire mineral interests in proved reserves and to drill and equip
development wells are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs and costs to drill exploratory wells which do not find proved reserves are expensed. Unproved oil and gas properties, which are individually significant, are periodically assessed
for impairment. The remaining unproved oil and gas properties are aggregated and amortized based upon remaining lease terms and exploratory and developmental drilling experience. Depreciation and depletion are calculated using the unit-of-production
method based upon periodic estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. 
63 Table of Contents
Other Property 
Gas processing plants and all other properties are stated at cost. Gas processing plants are depreciated using various rates based on estimated lives of available gas reserves. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life. Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Statement 142 on January 1, 2002.
Under Statement 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise. See Note F. Environmental Expenditures The Company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are
probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information
develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable. Revenue Recognition The Companys Marketing and Trading, Gathering and Processing, Transportation and
Storage, and Distribution segments recognize revenue when services are rendered or product is delivered. Major industrial and commercial gas distribution customers are invoiced as of the end of each month. Certain gas distribution customers,
primarily residential and some commercial, are invoiced on a cycle basis throughout the month, and the Company accrues unbilled revenues at the end of each month. ONGs and KGSs tariff rates for residential and commercial customers
contain a temperature normalization clause that provides for billing adjustments from actual volumes to normalized volumes during the winter heating season. Revenues from the Production segment are recognized on the sales method when oil and gas production volumes are delivered to the purchaser. Income Taxes Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is deferred and amortized for operations regulated by the OCC and KCC and for all other operations, is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company continues to amortize
previously deferred investment tax credits over the period prescribed by the OCC and KCC for ratemaking purposes. Common Stock Options and Awards At December 31, 2002, the Company has stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note
R. The Company accounts for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related Interpretations. The following table sets forth the effect on
net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair-value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Statement 123 to stock-based employee
compensation.

Earnings Per Common
Share In accordance with a pronouncement of the FASBs Staff at the EITF meeting in April 2001, codified as EITF Topic No. D-95 Topic D-95, the Company revised its computation of earnings per common share EPS. In accordance with
Topic D-95, the dilutive effect of the Companys Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is now considered in the computation of basic EPS, utilizing the if-converted method. Under the Companys if-converted method,
the dilutive effect of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on EPS cannot be less than the amount that would result from the application of the two-class method of computing EPS. The two-class method is an earnings
allocation formula that determines EPS for the common stock and the participating Series A Convertible Preferred Stock according to dividends declared and participating rights in the undistributed earnings. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
is a participating instrument with the Companys common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. For all periods presented, the two-class method resulted in additional dilution. Accordingly, EPS for such periods reflects this
further dilution. The Company restated the EPS amounts for all periods to be consistent with the revised methodology. See Note S. As a result of the Companys repurchase and exchange of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with Westar Industries in February 2003, the Company
will no longer apply the provisions of Topic D-95 to its EPS computation for periods beginning February 2003. See Note W. Labor Force The Company employed approximately 3,600 persons at December 31, 2002. Approximately 23 percent of the workforce, all of whom
are employed by KGS, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2003. Use of Estimates Certain amounts included in or affecting the Companys financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring the Company to make certain
assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Items which may be estimated include, but are not limited to, the economic useful life of assets, fair value of
assets and liabilities, obligations under employee benefit plans, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, unbilled revenues for gas delivered but for which meters have not been read, gas purchased expense for gas received but for which no
invoice has been received, the results of litigation and various other recorded or disclosed amounts. Accordingly, the reported amounts of the Companys assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures are necessarily
affected by these estimates. The Company evaluates these
estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the estimates. Any
effects on the Companys financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Reclassifications Certain amounts in prior period consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

B ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS In December 2002, the Company sold of some of
its midstream natural gas assets for a purchase price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include
three processing plants and related gathering systems and the Companys interest in a fourth processing plant. The sale of these assets is part of the Companys strategy to dispose of assets that are not considered core assets for its
future. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold the
majority of its investment in Magnum Hunter Resources MHR for a pre-tax gain of approximately $76 million, which is included in other income in the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company retained approximately 15 million
stock purchase warrants. On April 5, 2000, the Company acquired
certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Oklahoma, Kansas and western Texas from Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI. The Company also acquired KMIs marketing and trading operations, as well as some storage and transmission
pipelines in the mid-continent region. The Company paid approximately $1235 million for these assets and also assumed certain liabilities, including $1577 million for an uneconomic lease obligation. The Company also assumed some firm capacity
lease obligations to unaffiliated parties for which the Company established a reserve of approximately $2201 million for out-of-market terms of those obligations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The results of operations of this
acquisition are included in the consolidated statement of income subsequent to the purchase date. In June 2001, the Company sold its forty percent interest in K. Stewart Petroleum Corporation, a privately held exploration company, for a sales price of $77 million. In March 2000, the Company completed the sale of its 424 percent partnership
interest in Indian Basin Gas Processing Plant and gathering system for $55 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $267 million, which is included in other income in the Gathering and Processing segment. In March 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of assets located in
Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Texas panhandle from Dynegy, Inc. for $305 million. The assets include gathering systems, gas processing facilities, and transmission pipelines. On January 20, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company voted unanimously to terminate the merger agreement with Southwest
Gas Corporation Southwest in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. In 2002, the Company accrued $50 million and paid $30 million for settlement of certain claims related to this terminated merger and expensed $21 million of ongoing
litigation costs. In 2001, the Company expensed $37 million of ongoing litigation costs. In 2000, the Company expensed $137 million of previously deferred transaction and litigation costs. These costs were recorded to other expense for all
periods. See Note M. C
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In November 2002, the Company agreed to sell approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of its Production segment the
component for $300 million cash, subject to adjustment. The component is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets Statement 144. Accordingly, amounts in the financial statements and related notes for all periods shown reflect discontinued operations accounting. The Companys decision to sell the component was based on strategic evaluations
of the Production segment goals and favorable market conditions. The sale was completed in January 2003 and the Company recognized a pretax gain on the sale of the discontinued component of approximately $744 million in the first quarter of 2003.
The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in
discontinued operations are as follows:

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Market risks are monitored by a risk control group that operates independently from the operating segments that create or
actively manage these risk exposures. The risk control group ensures compliance with the Companys risk management policies. Risk Policy and Oversight The Company controls the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of
policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Companys Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with its audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised
of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including value-at-risk VAR and
position loss limits. The Company has a corporate risk control organization led by the 
67 Table of Contents
Vice President of Risk
Control, which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and
performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics. To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact the financial results and financial position of the Company either
favorably or unfavorably. As a result, the Company cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position. Trading Activities The Companys operating results are impacted by commodity price fluctuations. The Company routinely enters into derivative financial instruments in
order to minimize the risk of commodity price fluctuations related to its purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, transportation and storage contracts and inventories in its natural gas marketing and trading business. The Marketing and Trading segment includes the Companys wholesale and
retail natural gas marketing and trading operations. The Marketing and Trading segment generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchase and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and
delivery obligations. To the extent a net open position exists, fluctuating commodity market prices can impact the Companys financial position and results of operations, either favorably or unfavorably. The net open positions are actively
managed and the impact of the changing prices on the Companys financial condition at a point in time is not necessarily indicative of the impact of price movements throughout the year. Fair value The fair value and the average fair value of
derivative financial instruments, purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, transportation and storage contracts and inventories related to trading price risk management activities held during 2002 and 2001 are set forth as follows Fair Value December 31, 2002

The Company expanded its
traded products to include natural gas liquids and the related derivative components including ethane and propane during 2002. Notional amounts reflect the volume and indicated activity of transactions, but do not represent the amounts exchanged by the parties or cash requirements
associated with these financial instruments. Accordingly, notional amounts do not accurately measure the Companys exposure to market or credit risk. Credit Risk In conjunction with the market valuation of its energy commodity contracts, the Company provides reserves for risks associated
with its contract commitments, including credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company maintains
credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition including credit ratings, collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which allow for netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. Counterparties in its trading portfolio consist primarily of financial institutions, major energy companies, and local
distribution companies. This concentration of counterparties may impact the Companys overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or
other conditions. Based on the Companys policies, its exposures and its credit and other reserves, the Company does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty
nonperformance. Non-Trading Activities Financial instruments are also utilized for non-trading purposes to hedge
natural gas and crude oil production anticipated sales, anticipated fuel requirements, and inventories in the natural gas liquids business to hedge the impact of fair value fluctuations. The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest
rates in the normal course of business. The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Operating margins associated with the Gathering and Processing segments natural gas gathering, processing and
fractionation activities are sensitive to changes in natural gas liquids prices, principally as a result of contractual terms under which natural gas is processed and products are sold and the availability of inlet volumes. Also, certain processing
plant assets are impacted by changes in, and the relationship between, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which, in turn influences the volumes of gas processed. In 2000, the Company entered into derivative instruments related to the production of natural gas, most of which expired in
2001. These derivative instruments were designed as cash flow hedges to hedge the Production segments exposure to changes in the price of natural gas. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are reflected initially in other
69 Table of Contents
comprehensive income loss and subsequently realized in earnings when the forecasted transaction affects
earnings. In 2000, the Company recorded a cumulative effect charge of $22 million, net of tax, in the income statement and $28 million, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize at fair value the ineffective and effective
portions, respectively, of the losses on all derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments, which primarily consisted of costless option collars and swaps on natural gas production. The Company realized gains in earnings of approximately $39 million and
losses of $149 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to production hedges. The amounts are reported in operating revenues. Accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2002, includes
approximately $09 million related to cash flow exposure for production hedges and will be realized in earnings within the next 24 months. In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated fair value hedges, on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long-term
debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month LIBOR or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under
the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated fair value hedges, on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long-term debt. In January 2003, the rates were
locked through the first quarter of 2004. In 2002, the Company recorded a $79 million net increase in price risk management assets and liabilities to recognize the interest rate swaps at fair value. Long-term debt was also increased to recognize the
change in fair value of the related hedged liability. See Note K. Fair value The following table represents the estimated fair values of derivative instruments related to the Companys non-trading price risk management activities. The fair value is the carrying value for these
instruments at December 31, 2002 and 2001.  Approximate Fair Value ThousandsofDollars December 31, 2002 Natural gas commodities cash flow hedges

This excludes hedges related to the regulated entities as any incomestatement effect will be recovered through the cost of gas. Notional value The Company was a party to natural gas commodity
derivative instruments including swaps and options covering 66 Bcf and 190 Bcf of natural gas for December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Credit Risk The Company maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes significantly minimize overall
credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties financial condition including credit ratings, collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which allow for netting of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. The counterparties to the non-trading instruments include large integrated energy companies. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of
counterparty nonperformance. Financial Instruments

The OCC directed ONG to assume
responsibility for, and ownership of, customer service lines and has authorized the Company to defer as regulatory assets the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses incurred in connection with this plan. The recovery methodology,
amount, and calculation of these deferrals will be addressed in ONGs next rate case filing. Through December 2002, the Company has deferred approximately $19 million associated with this Commission directive. These deferred costs are included
in the caption Other in the above table of regulatory assets. The OCC has authorized ONG to defer the incremental costs associated with a five-year cathodic protection program to be implemented to comply with the OCCs Pipeline Safety Department inspection reports. The recovery methodology
and amount of these deferred expenses will be addressed in ONGs next rate case filing. Through December 2002, the Company has deferred approximately $28 million associated with this program. These deferred costs are included in the caption
Other in the above table of regulatory assets. The
OCC has authorized recovery of the take-or-pay settlement, pension and postretirement benefit costs over a 10 to 20 year period. KGS has been deferring and recording postretirement benefits in excess of pay-as-you-go as a regulatory asset as
authorized by the KCC. KGS included this regulatory asset in the rate case filing with the KCC in January 2003. See Note W. The KCC has allowed certain transition costs to be amortized and recovered in rates over a 40-year period with no rate of return on the unrecovered
balance. Management believes that all transition costs recorded as a regulatory asset will be recovered through rates based on the accounting orders received and regulatory precedents established by the KCC. These costs were included in the rate
case filing with the KCC in January 2003. The Company amortizes
reacquired debt costs in accordance with the accounting rules prescribed by the OCC and KCC. These costs were included as a component of interest in the most recent rate filing with the OCC and were included in the rate filing with the KCC in
January 2003. In accordance with various rate orders received
from the KCC, KGS has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a significant portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities. As management believes it is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable will be
recovered from customers, it has recorded a regulatory asset for these amounts. KGS included the net deferred income tax liabilities in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003. The KCC authorized deferral of weather normalization costs in 2000. In 2001, the KCC authorized deferral of line replacement
costs related to the re-piping of certain mobile home parks in Kansas. KGS included the weather normalization rider and the line replacement costs in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003. Recovery through rates resulted in amortization of regulatory assets of
approximately $119 million, $113 million and $106 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. F
GOODWILL The Company adopted Statement 142 on January 1, 2002. Under Statement 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more
frequently if certain indicators arise. Statement 142 prescribes a two phase process for testing the impairment of goodwill. The first phase identifies indicators of impairment. If an impairment is indicated, the second phase measures the
impairment. In accordance with the provisions of Statement 142, the Company has performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and, based upon this transition impairment test, no impairment to goodwill was indicated and the Company
did not record a charge in connection with the adoption of Statement 142. The Company will perform its annual test of goodwill as of January 1, 2003. Had the Company been accounting for its goodwill under Statement 142 for all periods presented, the
Companys net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:

CAPITAL STOCK Series A Convertible Preferred Stock The Company issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $001 per share, at the time of the
November 1997 transaction with Westar Energy Corp. formerly Western Resources, Inc. On February 5, 2003, the Company repurchased from Westar Industries approximately 9 million shares approximately 181 million shares of common stock equivalents
of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company exchanged the remaining shares for 218 million shares of its newly-created Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note W. The terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide that holders are entitled to receive a dividend payment, with
respect to each dividend period of the common stock, equal to 30 times the dividend amount declared in respect of each share of common stock for the first five years of the agreement. In November 2002, the rate was reduced to 25 times the dividend
amount declared in respect to each share of common stock, and at no time can the dividend be less than $180 per share on an aggregate annual basis. The dividend multiple was adjusted to reflect the 2001 two-for-one common stock split. Preferential
cash dividends are paid quarterly on each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, but those dividends are not cumulative to the extent they are not paid on any dividend payment date. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, subject to certain
restrictions, at the option of the holder, into ONEOK, Inc. Common Stock at the rate of two shares for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is equal to that payable per share of the Companys Common Stock, as adjusted
to reflect any stock split or similar events, assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to the event triggering the liquidation preference, plus any dividends. Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together
with holders of the Companys Common Stock with respect to certain matters. Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock cannot vote in any election of directors to the Companys Board of Directors or on any matter submitted to the
Companys shareholders other than those previously discussed and other matters as required by law. Series B Convertible Preferred Stock The terms of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are the same as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, except that the dividend amount is equal to
the greater of 25 times the common stock dividend, and at no time could the dividend be less than $150 per share on an aggregate annual basis during the first five years after the agreement, which ended November 27, 2002, and not less than $180
on an aggregate annual basis thereafter. There are no shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock currently outstanding. 
74 Table of Contents
Series C Preferred
Stock Series C Preferred Stock is designed to protect ONEOK, Inc. shareholders from coercive or unfair takeover tactics. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of ONEOK Common Stock,
quarterly dividends in an amount per share equal to the greater of $050 or subject to adjustment, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount payable in kind of all non-cash
dividends. No Series C Preferred Stock has been issued. Common Stock At December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 176 million shares of authorized and unreserved common stock available for issuance. On January 18, 2001, the Companys Board of Directors approved, and on May 17, 2001, the shareholders of the Company
voted in favor of, a two-for-one common stock split, which was effected through the issuance of one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock outstanding to holders of record on May 23, 2001, with distribution of the shares on
June 11, 2001. The Company retained the current par value of $001 per share for all shares of common stock. Shareholders equity reflects the stock split by reclassifying from Paid in Capital to Common Stock an amount equal to the cumulative
par value of the additional shares issued to effect the split. All share and per share amounts contained herein for all periods reflect this stock split. Outstanding convertible preferred stock is assumed to convert to common stock on a two-for-one
basis in the calculations of earnings per share. The Board of
Directors has reserved 120 million shares of ONEOK, Inc.s common stock for the Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, of which 188,000 shares, 424,000 shares and 190,000 shares were issued in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In January 2001, the Company amended and restated, in its entirety, the existing Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Company has reserved approximately 132 million shares for the Thrift Plan for Employees of
ONEOK, Inc. and Subsidiaries, less the number of shares issued to date under this plan. During 1999, the Company initiated a stock buyback plan for up to 15 percent of its capital stock. The program authorized the Company to make purchases of its common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of
purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. Through April 30, 2001, the shares purchased under this plan totaled 51 million, which has been adjusted for the two-for-one
stock split. The purchased shares are held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock-based compensation plans, and resale at a future date, or retirement. Purchases were financed with short-term debt or were made
from available funds. This plan expired in 2001. During 2001,
the Company began a second stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of its capital stock. The program authorized the Company to make purchases of its common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares
purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares are held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock-based compensation plans, and resale at a future date, or
retirement. This plan expired in 2002. At that time, the Company had not purchased any stock under this plan. Under the most restrictive covenants of the Companys loan agreements, $3641 million 72 percent of retained earnings were available to pay dividends at December 31, 2002. Under the
Companys existing credit agreement, it is restricted from declaring or making any dividend payment, directly or indirectly, or incurring any obligation to do so unless the aggregate amount so declared, paid or expended after August 31, 1998,
would not exceed an amount equal to 100 percent of our net income arising after August 31, 1998, plus $125 million and computed on a cumulative consolidated basis with other such transactions by the Company. The Companys credit agreement
contains no restrictions on the transfer of assets of its subsidiaries to ONEOK the parent company in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party. I
PAID IN CAPITAL Paid in capital was $3397 million and $3381 million for common stock at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Paid in capital for convertible
preferred stock was $5642 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001. J
LINES OF CREDIT AND SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE Commercial paper and short-term notes payable totaling $2655 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002. Commercial paper and short-term notes payable
totaling $5991 million were outstanding at December 31, 2001. The commercial paper and notes carried average interest rates of 199 percent and 425 percent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 
75 Table of Contents
Company has a $850 million short-term unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides a back-up line
of credit for commercial paper in addition to providing short-term funds. Interest rates and facility fees are based on prevailing market rates and the Companys credit ratings. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit and no
compensating balance requirements existed at December 31, 2002. Maximum short-term debt from all sources as approved by the Companys Board of Directors is $12 billion. K
LONG-TERM DEBT The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, are $63 million; $63 million; $3563 million; $3063 million; and $63
million for 2003 through 2007, respectively, including $60 million, which is callable at the option of the holder in each of those years, and $1870 million, which becomes callable at par at the option of ONEOK during 2003. In January 2003, the Company issued long-term debt concurrent with its public
equity offering. See Note W. In June 2002, the Company issued
$35 million of long-term variable rate debt, which is secured by the corporate airplane, at an interest rate of 125 percent over London InterBank Offered Rate LIBOR. All remaining long-term notes payable are unsecured. In August 2002, the
Company completed a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 844% Senior Notes due 2004 and the 832% Senior Notes due 2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately
$29 million and consent fees of approximately $18 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in the income statement. In April 2002, the Company retired $240 million of two-year floating rate notes that were issued in
April 2000. The interest rate for these notes reset quarterly at a 065 percent spread over the three month LIBOR. The proceeds from the notes were used to fund acquisitions. In 2001, the Company issued a $400 million note at a rate of 7125%. The
proceeds from the note were used to refinance short-term debt. The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business. The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps.
In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long-term debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month LIBOR or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In
October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200
million in fixed rate long-term debt. In January 2003, the rates were locked through the first quarter of 2004. In 2002, the Company recorded a $790 million net increase in price risk management assets to recognize at fair value its derivatives
that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Long-term debt was increased by approximately $783 million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability. The swaps generated $206 million of interest rate savings
during 2002. See further discussion of interest rate risk in Note D. The following table sets forth the Companys Long-Term Debt for the periods indicated.

The Companys
Revolving Credit Facility has customary covenants that relate to liens, investments, fundamental changes in the business, the restriction of certain payments, changes in the nature of the business, transactions with affiliates, burdensome
agreements, the use of the proceeds, and a limit on the Companys debt to capital ratio. Other debt agreements have negative covenants that relate to liens and sale/leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance
with all covenants. L
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Retirement Plans The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all employees. Company
officers and certain key employees are also eligible to participate in supplemental retirement plans. The Company generally funds pension costs at a level equal to the minimum amount required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. Other Postretirement Benefit Plans The
Company sponsors welfare care plans that provide postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits to substantially all employees who retire under the Retirement Plans with at least five years of service. Non-bargaining unit employees
retiring between the ages of 50 and 55 have access only to Company provided medical benefits. Non-bargaining unit employees retiring at age 55 or older are eligible for both the Company provided medical and life insurance benefits. The plans are
contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The Company elected to delay recognition of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation APBO and amortize it over 20 years as a component of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost. The following tables set
forth the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

For measurement
purposes, a 10 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits i.e., medical cost trend rate was assumed for 2002. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent by the year 2007 and remain at that level
thereafter. The medical cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing the assumed medical cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2002, by $150 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2002, by $15 million. Decreasing the assumed medical cost
trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002, by $124 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2002, by $12 million. Employee Thrift Plan The Company has a Thrift Plan covering substantially all employees. Employee contributions are discretionary. Subject to certain limits, the Company matches employee contributions. The cost of the
plan was $85 million, $88 million and $67 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Postemployment Benefits The Company pays postemployment benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before normal retirement in compliance with specific separation
agreements. Employees hired after January 1, 1999 are not eligible for this benefit. Regulatory Treatment The OCC has approved the recovery of ONG pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs through rates. The costs recovered through rates are based on current funding requirements and
the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for pension and postretirement costs, respectively. Differences, if any, between the expense and the amount ordered through rates are charged to earnings. Prior to the acquisition of the assets regulated by the KCC in fiscal 1998,
Western Resources, Inc. had established a corporate-owned life insurance COLI program that it believed in the long term would offset the expenses of its postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Accordingly, the KCC issued an
order permitting the deferral of postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses in excess of amounts recognized on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company did not acquire the COLI program. In connection with the KCCs approval of the
acquisition, the KCC granted the Company the benefit of all previous accounting orders issued to Western and requested that the Company submit a plan of recovery either through a general rate increase or through specific cost savings or revenue
increases. Based on regulatory precedents established by the KCC and the accounting order, which permits the Company to seek recovery through rates, management believes that it is probable that accrued postretirement and postemployment benefits can
be recovered in rates. The Company filed for recovery of these costs in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003 requesting recovery over a period not to exceed approximately 10 years. If these costs cannot be recovered in rates charged to
customers, the Company would be required to record a one-time charge to expense for a portion of the regulatory asset established for postretirement and postemployment benefit costs totaling approximately $492 million at December 31, 2002. M
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Leases The initial term of the Companys headquarters building, ONEOK Plaza, is for 25 years, expiring in 2009, with six five-year
renewal options. At the end of the initial term or any renewal period, the Company can purchase the property at its fair market value. Annual rent expense for the lease will be approximately $68 million until 2009. Rent payments were $93 million
in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000. Estimated future minimum rental payments for the lease are $93 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2003 through 2009.

The Company has the right to sublet excess office space in ONEOK Plaza. The Company received rental revenue of $32 million in fiscal year 2002 and $35 million in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 for
various subleases. Estimated minimum future rental payments to be received under existing contracts for subleases are $30 million in 2003, $25 million in 2004, $18 million in 2005, $13 million in 2006, $05 million in 2007 and a total of $07
million thereafter. Other operating leases include a gas
processing plant, office buildings, and equipment. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2002, are $299 million in 2003, $261 million in
2004, $275 million in 2005, $407 million in 2006 and $267 million in 2007. The above amounts include lease payments for auto leases that are accounted for as operating leases but are treated as capital leases for income tax purposes. Also, the
above amounts include the following minimum lease payments relating to the lease of a gas processing plant: $162 million in 2003, $209 million in 2004, $242 million in 2005, $377 million in 2006 and $242 million in 2007. The Company has a
liability for uneconomic lease terms relating to the gas processing plant, which was acquired from KMI. Accordingly, the liability is amortized to rent expense in the amount of $130 million per year over the term of the lease. The amortization of
the liability reduces rent expense; however, the cash outflow under the lease remains the same. Southwest Gas Corporation In May 1999, a series of lawsuits were filed in connection with the Companys and Southern Union Companys Southern Union failed attempts to merge
with Southwest. The Company, Southern Union and Southwest all sued each other and Southern Union made claims against a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission and other individuals, including officers and directors of the Company. On August 9, 2002, the Company and Southwest settled their claims against each
other for a payment of $30 million by ONEOK to Southwest. On January 3, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement with Southern Union resolving all remaining legal issues. It also resolved the claims against John A. Gaberino,
Jr. and Eugene Dubay related to this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company paid $50 million to Southern Union, which is included in the December 31, 2002 financial statements. The Company and its affiliated parties are released
from any claims against them brought by Southern Union related to the terminated acquisition of Southwest. Two substantially identical derivative actions were filed by shareholders against members of the Board of Directors of the Company alleging violation of their fiduciary duties to the Company by causing
or allowing the Company to engage in certain fraudulent and improper schemes related to the planned acquisition of Southwest and waste of corporate assets. These two cases have been consolidated. They allege conduct by the Company caused the Company
to be sued by both Southwest and Southern Union, which exposed the Company to millions of dollars in liabilities. The plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive damages and costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney fees. The Company
and its independent directors and officers named as defendants filed Motions to Dismiss the action for failure of the plaintiffs to make a pre-suit demand on the Companys Board of Directors. In addition, the independent directors and certain
officers filed Motions to Dismiss the action for failure to state a claim. On February 26, 2001, the action was stayed until one of the parties notifies the Court that a dissolution of the stay is requested. Except as set forth above, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss
associated with these matters. If substantial damages were ultimately awarded, this could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Environmental The Company has 12 manufactured gas sites located
in Kansas, which may contain potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the Kansas
Department of Health and Environment KDHE presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow the Company to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations
and risk analysis. Remedial investigation has commenced on four sites. However, a comprehensive study is not complete and the results to date do not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable estimation of the total liability. The liability accrued
is reflective of an estimate of the total cost of remedial investigation and feasibility study. Through December 31, 2002, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. The site
situations are not common and the Company has no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. The information currently available estimates the cost of remediation to range from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison
of costs incurred by others to remediate comparable sites. As such, the information provides an insufficient basis to reasonably estimate a minimum range of the Companys liability. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance
recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties. At this time, the Company is not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that
additional information and testing could 
80 Table of Contents
result in costs significantly
below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to the Companys results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of
years over which the remediation is completed. Yaggy
Facility In January 2001, the Yaggy gas storage facilitys operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. In July 2002,
the KDHE issued an administrative order that assessed a $180,000 civil penalty against the Company, based on alleged violations of several KDHE regulations. A status conference was held on February 12, 2003, and another one has been scheduled for
April 10, 2003, regarding progress toward reaching an agreed consent order. The Company believes there are no long-term environmental effects from the Yaggy storage facility. Two separate class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company in connection with the natural gas explosions and
eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred in or near Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. These class action lawsuits were filed on the grounds that the eruptions and explosions related to natural gas that allegedly escaped from the Yaggy
storage facility. On January 17, 2003, the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims and all non-class members expired. In addition to the two class action matters, sixteen other cases have been filed against the Company or its
subsidiaries seeking recovery for various claims, including property damage, personal injury, loss of business and, in some instances, punitive damages. Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Companys insurance carrier in these cases represents the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is vigorously defending itself against
all claims. Other The OCC staff filed an
application on February 1, 2001, to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season and to determine if these practices were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether the
Companys procurement decisions resulted in fair, just and reasonable costs being borne by ONG customers. In a hearing on October 31, 2001, the OCC issued an oral ruling that ONG not be allowed to recover the balance in the Companys
unrecovered purchased gas cost UPGC account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter. This was effective with the first billing cycle for the month following the issuance of a final order. A final order, issued on November
20, 2001, halted the recovery process effective December 1, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the OCC approved a request to stay the order and allowed ONG to begin collecting unrecovered gas costs, subject to refund had the Company ultimately lost the
case. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company took a charge of $346 million as a result of this order. In May 2002, the Company, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma
Attorney General, and other stipulating parties, entered into a joint settlement agreement resolving this gas cost issue and ongoing litigation related to a contract with Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc. The settlement agreement has a $337 million value to ONG customers that will
be realized over a three-year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $91 million, with an additional $10 million available for former customers
returning to the ONG system. If the additional $10 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG is replacing certain gas contracts, which is
expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $138 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $80 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are
expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $18 million credit will be added to the
final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. As a result of this settlement agreement, the Company revised its estimate of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 downward by $142 million to $204 million and
recorded the adjustment in the second quarter of 2002 as a decrease to cost of gas. The Company is a party to other litigation matters and claims, which are normal in the course of its operations, and while the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the
final outcome of such matters will not have a materially adverse effect on consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. N

371,938 The Company has
remaining net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $262 million and $3443 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002, which expire, unless previously utilized, at various dates through the year
2022. This includes federal carryforwards of $12 million and state carryforwards of $119 million related to the discontinued component. Management believes the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $60 million in deferred investment tax credits recorded in other deferred credits, which will be amortized over the next 13 years. O
SEGMENT INFORMATION Management has divided its operations into six reportable segments based on similarities in economic characteristics, products and services, types of
customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environment. These segments are as follows: 1 the Marketing and Trading segment markets natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and markets electricity to wholesale customers; 2 the
Gathering and Processing segment gathers and processes natural gas and fractionates, stores and markets natural gas liquids; 3 the Transportation and Storage segment gathers, transports and stores natural gas for others and buys and sells natural
gas; 4 the Distribution segment distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers, leases pipeline capacity to others and provides transportation services to end-use customers; 5 the Production segment develops and
produces natural gas and oil; and 6 the Other segment primarily operates and leases the Companys headquarters building and a related parking facility. During the first quarter of 2002, the Power segment was combined with the Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects the
Companys strategy of trading around the Companys recently completed electric generating power plant. All segment data has been reclassified to reflect this change. In July 2002, the Company completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from the Transportation
and Storage segment to the Distribution segment. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted for this transfer. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment
gross sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated customers. Intersegment sales for the Marketing and Trading segment were $2992 million, $6147 million and $2997 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. All corporate overhead costs relating to a reportable segment have been allocated for the purpose of calculating operating income, including depreciation expense related to the Companys computer operating system, which is
recorded in the Other segment. The Companys equity method investments do not represent

operating segments of the
Company. There are no single external customers from which the Company receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues. The following tables set forth certain selected financial information for the Companys six operating segments for the periods indicated. Regulated

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION Stock Splits Due to the 2001 stock split, the number of shares and related exercise prices have been adjusted to maintain both the total
market value of common stock underlying the options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP share elections, and the relationship between the fair market value of the common stock and the exercise price of the options and ESPP share elections.
Deferred Compensation Plans Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan The ONEOK,
Inc. Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan provides select employees, as approved by the Board of Directors, with the option to defer portions of their compensation and provides non-qualified deferred compensation benefits which are not
available due to limitations on employer and employee contributions to qualified defined contribution plans under the federal tax laws. Under the plan, participants have the option to defer their salary and/or bonus compensation to a short-term
deferral account, which pays out a minimum of five years from commencement, or a long-term deferral account, which pays out at retirement or termination of the employee. Participants are immediately 100% vested. Short-term deferral accounts are
allocated to the Five Year Treasury Bond Fund. Long-term deferral accounts are allocated among various investment options, including ONEOK Common Stock. At the distribution date, cash is distributed to the employees based on the fair market value of
the investment at that date. Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors The ONEOK, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides directors of the Company, who are not employees of the Company, the option to defer all or a portion of their compensation for their
service on the Companys Board of Directors. Under the plan, directors may elect either a cash deferral option or a phantom stock option. Under the cash deferral option, directors may defer the receipt of all or a portion of their annual
retainer and/or meeting fees, plus accrued interest. Under the phantom stock option, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer and/or meeting fees and receive such fees on a deferred basis in the form of shares of common stock
under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan. Shares are distributed to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of distribution. Stock Option Plans Long-Term Incentive Plan The ONEOK, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock
options, stock bonus awards, and restricted stock awards to key employees and the granting of stock awards to non-employee directors. The Company has reserved approximately 78 million shares of common stock for the plan, less the number of shares
previously issued under the plan. The maximum numbers of shares for which options or other awards may be granted to any employee during any year is 300,000. Under the plan, options may be granted by the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee. Stock options and awards may be granted at any time until
all shares authorized are transferred, except that no incentive stock option may be granted under the plan after August 17, 2005. Options may be granted which are not exercisable until a fixed future date or in installments. The plan also provides
for restored options to be granted in the event an optionee surrenders shares of 
87 Table of Contents
common stock that the optionee already owns in full or partial payment of the option price of an option
being exercised and/or surrenders shares of common stock to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option. A restored option is for the number of shares surrendered by the optionee and has an option price equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date on which the exercise of an option resulted in the grant of the restored option. Options issued to date become void upon voluntary termination of employment other than retirement. In the event of retirement or involuntary termination,
the optionee may exercise the option within three months. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee within a period to be determined by the Committee and stated in the option. A portion of the
options issued to date can be exercised after one year from grant date and an option must be exercised no later than ten years after grant date. Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors The ONEOK, Inc. Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for the
granting of incentive stock bonus awards, performance unit awards, restricted stock awards, and non-qualified stock options to Non-Employee Directors. The Company has reserved 700,000 shares, less the number of shares previously issued under the
plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to which options or other awards may be granted to any Non-Employee Director during any year is 20,000. Under the plan, options may be granted by the Committee at any time on or before January 18, 2011. Options may be exercisable
in full at the time of grant or may become exercisable in one or more installments. The plan also provides for restored options in the event that the optionee surrenders shares of common stock that the optionee already owns in full or partial
payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or surrenders shares of common stock to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option. A restored option is for the number of shares surrendered by the
optionee, and has an option price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date the exercise of an option resulted in the grant of the restored option. Options issued to date become void upon termination of service as a Non-Employee
Director. Such options must be exercised no later than ten years after the date of grant of the option. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee. The following table sets forth the stock option activity for the periods
indicated.  Number of Shares Weighted Average ExercisePrice

$2165. Restricted Stock Awards Under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted stock awards also may be granted to key officers and employees. Ownership of the common stock vests over a three-year period. Shares awarded may not be sold during the vesting period. The fair market value of the
shares associated with the restricted stock awards is recorded as unearned compensation in shareholders equity and is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. The dividends on the restricted stock awards are reinvested in
common stock. The average price of shares granted was $1705, $2231 and $1316 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Restricted stock information has been restated to give effect to the 2001 two-for-one stock split. The following table sets forth the restricted stock

1774 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan In 1995, the Company authorized the ESPP and the Company currently has 28 million shares reserved for the ESPP, less the number of shares issued to date under this plan. Subject to certain exclusions, all full-time
employees are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose to have up to ten percent of their annual earnings withheld to purchase the Companys common stock. The Committee may allow contributions to be made by
other means provided that in no event will contributions from all means exceed ten percent of the employees annual earnings. The purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of the lower of its grant date or exercise date market price.
Approximately 61 percent, 56 percent, and 56 percent of eligible employees participated in the plan in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Under the plan, the Company sold 285,200 shares in 2002, 192,593 shares in 2001, and 523,044
shares in 2000. Accounting Treatment The Company
has applied APB 25 in accounting for both plans through 2002. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the Companys options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company adopted
Statement 123 on January 1, 2003, and will expense the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003. See Note A for disclosure of the Companys pro forma net income and earnings per share
information had the Company applied the provisions of Statement 123 to determine the compensation cost under these plans for the periods indicated. 
89 Table of Contents
The fair market value of each
option granted was estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: volatility of 221 percent for 2002, 211 percent for 2001, and 212 percent for 2000; dividend yield of 36 percent for 2002, 55
percent for 2001, and 63 percent for 2000; and risk-free interest rate of 51 percent for 2002, 52 percent for 2001, and 57 percent for 2000. Expected life ranged from 1 to 10 years based upon experience to date and the make-up of the optionees. Fair value of options granted at fair market value
under the Plan were $388, $317 and $276 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fair value of options granted above fair market value under the Plan was $350 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The average exercise
price of options granted above fair market value is $2349 for the year ended December 31, 2001. S

536,780 Future cash inflows are
computed by applying year-end prices averaging $3020 per barrel of oil, adjusted for transportation and other charges, and $469 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2002 to the year-end quantities of proved reserves. As of December 31, 2002, a portion
of proved developed gas production for continuing operations in 2003 has been hedged. The effects of these hedges are not reflected in the computation of future cash flows above. If the effects of the hedges had been included, the future cash
inflows would have decreased by approximately $12 million.

These estimated future cash
flows are reduced by estimated future development and production costs based on year-end cost levels, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. The tax expense is calculated by applying the
current year-end statutory tax rates to pretax net cash flows net of tax depreciation, depletion, and lease amortization allowances applicable to oil and gas production. The following table sets forth the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow relating to proved oil
and gas reserves for the periods indicated:  Continuing Operations Years Ended December 31 Discontinued Component Years Ended December 31 2002 2001 2000 2002 2001 2000 Thousands of Dollars Beginning of period

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED On January 3, 2003, the Company closed the purchase of all of the Texas assets of Southern Union Company for $420 million. The gas distribution operations
serve approximately 535,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville, and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential.
The acquisition includes a 125-mile natural gas transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in gas marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also includes natural gas distribution
investments in Mexico. The distribution assets will be operated under the name Texas Gas Service Company, a division of ONEOK, Inc. On January 3, 2003, the Company completed a definitive settlement agreement with Southern Union resolving all remaining legal issues stemming from the
Companys terminated offer to acquire Southwest Gas. It also resolved the claims against John A. Gaberino, Jr. and Eugene Dubay related to this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company has paid $5 million to Southern Union, which
is included in the December 31, 2002, financial statements. On
January 9, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Westar Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., to repurchase a portion of the shares of the Companys Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Series A
held by Westar and to exchange Westars remaining 109 million shares of Series A for 218 million newly-created shares of ONEOKs $0925 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock Series D. The Series A shares were convertible into two shares
of common stock, reflecting the two-for-one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D has substantially the same terms as the Series A, except that a the Series D has a fixed
quarterly cash dividend of 23125 cents per share, b the Series D is redeemable by ONEOK at any time after August 1, 2006, at a redemption price of $20, in the event that the closing price of ONEOK common stock exceeds $25 for 30 consecutive
trading days, c each share of Series D is convertible into one share of ONEOK common stock, and d Westar Industries may not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend for the ONEOK common stock for the
previous year is greater than 925 cents per share and such conversion would not subject ONEOK to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The agreement also restricts Westar from selling more than five percent to any one person or group who
already owns five percent or more of ONEOKs outstanding common stock. The KCC approved the Companys agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, the Company consummated the agreement by 
94 Table of Contents
purchasing $300 million approximately 181 million shares of common stock equivalents of its Series A
convertible preferred stock from Westar Industries. The Company exchanged Westars remaining 109 million Series A shares for approximately 218 million shares of the Companys newly-created Series D convertible preferred stock. Also, in
connection with that transaction, a new rights agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement became effective. In addition, the Company agreed to register for resale, within 60 days after the February 5, 2003,
closing, all of the shares of its common stock held by Westar Industries, as well as all the shares of its Series D convertible preferred stock issued to Westar Industries and all of the shares of its common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series D convertible preferred stock. As a result of this transaction and the Companys recently completed stock offering, discussed below, Westars equity interest in the Company has been reduced from approximately 444 percent to
approximately 274 percent on a fully diluted basis. As a result
of the Westar transaction, the Company will no longer apply the provisions of EITF Topic D-95 to its EPS computation beginning in February 2003, because the Series D does not participate in earnings beyond the stated dividend rate of 925 cents per
share. Under Topic D-95, the Company was required to reduce EPS by the dilutive effect of the two-class method of EPS computation. On January 12, 2003, the Company announced plans for concurrent offerings of its common stock and equity units under its $1 billion shelf registration
statement. On January 28, 2003, the Company issued 12 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $1719 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16524 per share, or
$1983 million in the aggregate. The Company granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 18 million shares of the Companys common stock at the same price, which was exercised on February 7, 2003,
resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $297 million. Also on January 28, 2003, the Company issued 14 million equity units at a public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $2425 per share, or $3395
million in the aggregate. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of the Companys common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to the Companys existing
Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 85% 40% annual face amount of the senior notes plus 45% annual contract adjustment payments. Each stock purchase contract issued as a part of the
equity units carries a maximum conversion premium of up to 20 percent over the $1719 closing price of the Companys common stock on January 22, 2003. The Company granted the underwriters a 13-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an
additional 21 million additional equity units at the same price, which was exercised on January 31, 2003, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $509 million. On January 31, 2003, the Company announced that it had closed on the sale of certain natural gas and oil producing properties
for $300 million in cash, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the sale, ONEOK Resources Company, the production segment of ONEOK, Inc., sold natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 475 of which
were operated by the Company. The Company recorded a pretax gain of approximately $744 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to this sale. See Note C. KGS filed a rate case on January 31, 2003, to increase rates by $76 million. The KCC has up to 240 days to review the application and issue a final order.
If approved, the new rates would become effective for the 2003/2004 winter heating season. Until regulatory approval is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedule.
