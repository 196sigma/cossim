To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of TransAct Technologies Incorporated In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of changes in
shareholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of TransAct Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December
31, 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for the opinion expressed above. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION
TransAct Technologies Incorporated TransAct or the Company
began operating as a stand-alone, publicly-held company in August 1996 to
conduct the printer business that was formerly operated by certain
subsidiaries of Tridex Corporation Tridex.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.
2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS: TransAct, through its primary operating
facility in Ithaca, NY, operates in one industry segment,
transaction-based printers and related products. TransAct designs,
develops, manufactures and markets transaction-based printers under the
IthacaR and MagnetecR brand names. In addition, the Company markets
related consumables, spare parts and service. The Company also operates a
small component production line in a manufacturing facility in
Wallingford, CT that it expects to close in May 2002 see Note 8 for a
further discussion. The Company printers are used worldwide to provide
transaction records such as receipts, tickets, coupons, register journals
and other documents. The Company focuses on the following vertical
markets: point-of-sale POS, gaming and lottery, financial services and
kiosk. The Company sells its products directly to end users, original
equipment manufacturers OEM, value-added resellers and selected
distributors, primarily in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin
America.
TransAct designs, develops, manufactures and markets a broad array
of transaction-based printers utilizing inkjet, thermal and impact
printing technology for applications requiring up to 60 character columns
in each of its vertical markets. The Company printers are configurable,
which offer customers the ability to choose from a variety of features and
functions. Options typically include printed circuit board configuration,
paper cutting devices, paper handling capacities and number of print
stations. In addition to its configurable printers, TransAct manufactures
custom printers for certain OEM customers. In collaboration with these
customers, the Company provides engineering and manufacturing expertise
for the design and development of specialized printers.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates
have been made in areas including inventory valuation, estimated lives of
fixed assets and goodwill, deferred tax assets, accrued liabilities,
restructuring reserves related to the Consolidation, allowance for
doubtful accounts and tax provisions benefits. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, after elimination of all material intercompany accounts and
transactions.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with a maturity date of three months or less at date of
purchase to be cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis or market.
FIXED ASSETS: Fixed assets are stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided for primarily by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives. The estimated useful life of machinery, furniture and
equipment is three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the asset.
Depreciation amounted to $2,858,000, $2,176,000 and $1,699,000 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. Depreciation for 2001 included $680,000 of

2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
GOODWILL: On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
approved Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business
Combinations FAS 141 and No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets FAS 142.
FAS 141 supercedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No.
16, Business Combinations. The most significant changes made by FAS 141
are: 1 requiring that the purchase method of accounting be used for all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001, 2 establishing
specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from
goodwill, and 3 requiring unallocated negative goodwill to be written
off immediately as an extraordinary gain instead of being deferred and
amortized.
FAS 142 supercedes APB No. 17, Intangibles Assets. FAS 142
primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
subsequent to their acquisition. The provisions of FAS 142 will be
effective for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2002. The most
significant changes made by FAS 142 are: 1 goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets will no longer be amortized, 2 goodwill will be tested
for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, 3
intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life will be tested for
impairment at least annually, and 4 the amortization period of
intangible assets with finite lives will no longer be limited to forty
years.
The Company has not entered into any business combinations
subsequent to June 30, 2001. However, the Company is currently amortizing
goodwill related to the acquisition of i Ithaca Peripherals, Inc.
Ithaca in 1991 and the ii ribbon business formerly conducted by
Tridex Tridex Ribbon Business. The original amount applicable to the
Ithaca acquisition totaled $3,536,000 and is being amortized on the
straight-line method over 20 years. The original amount applicable to the
Tridex Ribbon Business acquisition totaled $180,000 and is being amortized
on the straight-line method over five years. Accumulated amortization of
goodwill was $2,247,000 and $2,038,000 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The Company believes there will be no impact upon the
adoption of FAS 142.
ACCRUED WARRANTY COSTS: The Company warranties its products for up
to two years and records the estimated cost of such product warranties at
the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon
actual past experience of product returns and the related estimated cost
of labor and material to make the necessary repairs.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales are recognized when evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the selling price is fixed and
determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue from
extended warranty and maintenance agreements is recognized over the term
of such agreements as services are performed. Sales to GTECH Corporation
GTECH for lottery printers accounted for approximately 33% of net
sales during 2001. Sales to GTECH and ICL Pathway for the British Post
Office project accounted for approximately 22% and 20% of net sales
during 2000, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of
net sales during 1999.
FOREIGN CURRENCY: The financial position and results of operations
of the Company foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as
the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have
been translated at end of period exchange rates, and related revenues and
expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates.
Transaction gains losses are included in other income and amounted to
$12,000, $26,000 and $11,000 in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: The income tax amounts reflected in the accompanying
financial statements are accounted for under the liability method in
accordance with FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.                    21            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

2.  BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has elected to follow
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations in accounting for
its stock options. Since the exercise price of employee stock options
granted by the Company generally equals the market price of the underlying
stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recorded. The
Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation FAS 123. See Note 11.
SEGMENT REPORTING: FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information FAS 131 requires that a public business enterprise report
financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating
segments. Generally, financial information is required to be reported on
the basis that it is used internally for evaluating segment performance
and allocating resources. The Company has assessed its operating and
reportable segments and determined that it operates in one reportable
segment as defined in FAS 131.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES: The Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial
Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities FAS 133 in June 1998 which, as amended, is currently
effective January 1, 2001 for the Company. The Company believes adoption
of FAS 133 will not have a material impact on the Company financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS: In July 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations FAS 143. FAS 143 requires recognition of the fair value of
liabilities associated with the retirement of long-lived assets when a
legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the
acquisition, construction, development and/or the normal operation of a
long-lived asset. FAS 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002. The Company does not expect that the issuance of FAS 143
will have any impact on the Company consolidated financial statements.
IMPAIRMENT OF DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: In August 2001, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144, which supercedes
FAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed. FAS 144 requires that long-lived assets
to be disposed of by sale, including discontinued operations, be measured
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether
reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations. The
provisions of FAS 144 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The Company does not expect that the issuance of FAS
144 will have any impact on the Company consolidated financial
statements.
3.  ACQUISITION
On May 28, 1999, the Company acquired the business and substantially
all the assets of the Tridex Ribbon Business for total cash consideration
of approximately $295,000. The acquisition has been accounted for by the
purchase method of accounting. The purchased assets and liabilities have
been recorded in the Company financial statements at their estimated
fair values at the acquisition date. The results of operations of the
acquired company have been included with those of the Company since the
date of acquisition. The acquisition cost exceeded the fair value of the
net assets acquired by $180,000. Such goodwill is being amortized over a
five-year period on a straight-line basis. Prior to the acquisition, the
Company provided Tridex with space within its Wallingford, CT
manufacturing facility and certain support services for the Tridex Ribbon
Business.                    22            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

8.  ACCRUED BUSINESS CONSOLIDATION AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES
In February 2001, the Company announced plans to establish a global
engineering and manufacturing center at its Ithaca, NY facility. As part
of this strategic decision, the Company undertook a plan to consolidate
all manufacturing and engineering into its existing Ithaca, NY facility
and close its Wallingford, CT facility the Consolidation. As of
December 31, 2001, substantially all Wallingford product lines were
successfully transferred to Ithaca, NY. The Company expects to maintain
one small component production line in Wallingford until May 2002, after
which the manufacturing facility will be closed. The closing of the
Wallingford facility is expected to result in the termination of
employment of approximately 70 production, administrative and management
employees. The Company has applied the consensus set forth in EITF 94-3,
Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity Including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring in recognizing the accrued restructuring expenses. The
Company estimates that the non-recurring costs associated with the
Consolidation, including severance pay, stay bonuses, employee benefits,
moving expenses, non-cancelable lease payments, accelerated depreciation
and other costs, will be approximately $42 million, of which
approximately $41 million was recognized during 2001.
During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a
restructuring charge of $189,000 for severance costs related to the
downsizing and reorganization of its manufacturing facility in
Wallingford, CT. Severance costs resulted from the reduction of 11
employees.

12.  STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS AND WARRANTS
STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. The Company currently has three primary stock
incentive plans: the 1996 Stock Plan which provides for the grant of
awards to officers and other key employees of the Company, the 1996
Directors' Stock Plan which provides for non-discretionary awards to
non-employee directors, and the 2001 Employee Stock Plan which provides
for the grant of awards to key employees of the Company and other
non-employees who may provide services to the Company. The plans generally
provide for awards in the form of: i incentive stock options, ii
non-qualified stock options, iii shares of restricted stock, iv
restricted units, v stock appreciation rights or vi limited stock
appreciation rights. However, the 2001 Employee Stock Plan does not
provide for incentive stock option awards. Options granted under these
plans are at prices equal to 100% of the fair market value of the common
stock at the date of grant. Options granted have a ten-year term and
generally vest over a three- to five-year period, unless automatically
accelerated for certain defined events. At December 31, 2001, the Company
has reserved 1,150,000, 110,000 and 150,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan, the 1996 Directors' Stock Plan, and

The weighted average fair value of restricted stock granted was
$475, $875 and $750 for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Of the
89,360 shares of restricted stock outstanding at December 31, 2001, 15,360
shares vest over a five-year period, 54,000 shares vest at the end of a
five-year period, 10,000 shares vest over a three-year period and 10,000
shares vest over a two-year period. Under certain conditions, vesting may
be automatically accelerated. Upon issuance of the restricted stock,
unearned compensation equivalent to the market value at the date of grant
is charged to a separate component of shareholders' equity and
subsequently amortized over the vesting period. Amortization expense of
$264,000, $277,000 and $254,000 was recorded during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively.
WARRANTS: On August 22, 1996, the Company sold to the underwriters
of its initial public offering, for nominal consideration, a warrant to
purchase from the Company up to 115,000 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $1020 per share. The warrant expired on August 20,
2001.
On April 7, 2000, in connection with the sale of the Preferred
Stock, the Company issued to its investment advisors, McFarland Dewey &
Co., warrants to purchase from the Company up to 10,000 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $900 per share. The warrants are
exercisable through April 7, 2005.                    28            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

13.  STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
In December 1997, the Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder
Rights Plan declaring a distribution of one right the Rights for each
outstanding share of the Company common stock to shareholders of record
at December 15, 1997. Initially, each of the Rights will entitle the
registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of a
share of Series A Preferred Stock, $001 par value, at a price of $69 per
one one-thousandth of a share. The Rights, however, will not become
exercisable unless and until, among other things, any person or group of
affiliated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of
the then outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock. If a person, or
group of persons, acquires 15 percent or more of the outstanding Common
Stock of the Company subject to certain conditions and exceptions more
fully described in the Rights Agreement, each Right will entitle the
holder other than the person, or group of persons, who acquired 15
percent or more of the outstanding Common Stock to purchase Preferred
Stock of the Company having a market value equal to twice the exercise
price of the Right. The Rights are redeemable, under certain
circumstances, for $00001 per Right and will expire, unless earlier
redeemed, on December 2, 2007.
On February 16, 1999, the Company amended its Stockholder Rights
Plan to remove the provision in the plan that stipulated that the plan may
be modified or redeemed only by those members of the Board of Directors
who are defined as continuing directors.

The Company also has approximately $147,000 in federal research and
development tax credit carryforwards that expire in 2020. The Company had
foreign income before taxes of $232,000, $665,000 and $65,000 in 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively.
Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
financial statements. The Company gross deferred tax assets and
liabilities were comprised of the following                    29            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

The gross deferred tax asset is largely the result of the Company
net operating loss in 2001 due to the Consolidation. Based on recent tax
law changes, the Company will carry back its federal net operating losses
to prior years, which is expected to result in a tax refund of
approximately $700,000 in 2002. Based on annual cost savings expected to
be realized as a result of the Consolidation, future financial projections
and the ability to carry back net operating losses, the Company has
determined that no valuation allowance is considered necessary.

the Company effective income tax rate are analyzed below                                 Year Ended December 31,

15.  DISCLOSURE REGARDING FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying
amount of receivables, other current assets, other assets, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities is a reasonable estimate of fair value
because of the short nature of the transactions. The carrying value of
long-term debt approximates the fair value based upon the variable rate on
that debt.
Off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments include
interest-rate swaps. At December 31, 1999, interest-rate swaps, held for
purposes other than trading, had a fair value settlement of $35,000, based
on the underlying principal amount of $3,000,000. The Company sold its
interest-rate swap during 2000.                    30            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

16.  SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS
PREFERRED STOCK SALE: On April 7, 2000 the Company sold 4,000 shares
of 7% Series B Cumulative Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock the
Preferred Stock to Advance Capital Advisors, L.P. and its affiliate in
consideration of $1,000 per share the Stated Value, for a total of
$4,000,000, less issuance costs. The Preferred Stock is convertible at any
time by the holders at a conversion price of $900 per common share. In
addition, the Company issued warrants pro-rata to the Preferred Stock
holders to purchase an aggregate of 44,444 shares of the Company common
stock at an exercise price of $900 per common share. The warrants, valued
at $175,000, are exercisable at any time until April 7, 2005, and will be
accreted to preferred stock ratably over 60 months. The Preferred Stock is
subject to mandatory conversion into shares of the Company common stock
when such stock has traded at $35 per share or more for a 30-day period
ending on or after April 7, 2003, or for a 60-day period beginning on or
after April 7, 2002. The Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of
the holders on April 7, 2005 at $1,000 per share plus any unpaid
dividends. On or after April 7, 2007, the Company has the right to require
1 redemption of the Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share plus any unpaid
dividends or 2 conversion of the Preferred Stock at $900 per common
share. Upon a change of control which the Company does not believe
probable, holders have the right to redeem the Preferred Stock for 200%
of the Stated Value plus any unpaid dividends. The holders of the
Preferred Stock have certain voting rights and are entitled to receive a
cumulative annual dividend of $70 per share, payable quarterly and have
preference to any other dividends, if any, paid by the Company.
Concurrent with the issuance of the Preferred Stock, the Company
recorded a beneficial conversion charge. The beneficial conversion charge
was calculated as the difference between the assigned fair value of the
Preferred Stock and the fair value of the related common stock, as of
April 7, 2000, into which the Preferred Stock was immediately convertible.
Accordingly, a deemed preferred dividend of approximately $56,000 as of
the issuance date has been recognized as a charge to retained earnings and
net loss attributable to common shareholders, and as an increase to
additional paid-in capital.
GTECH LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT: On June 25, 1999, the Company commenced a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode
Island against GTECH for misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of
contract and related claims, seeking injunctive relief and compensatory
and punitive damages. On July 15, 1999, GTECH and the Company signed a new
five-year agreement under which the Company will be the exclusive
manufacturer and supplier to GTECH of an impact printer for use in GTECH
IsysR online lottery terminal. As part of the agreement, GTECH agreed to
pay the Company $1 million for past design efforts, development costs and
manufacturing interruption costs and agreed to place a non-cancelable
order for delivery of a minimum of approximately $8 million of printers in
the year 2000. In connection with the execution of this agreement, the
parties agreed to have all claims under the lawsuits dismissed and filed
dismissal stipulations to terminate the federal and state lawsuits. As a
result of the settlement, the Company reported $770,000 $1 million cash
settlement, less $230,000 of directly-related expenses in other income
during 1999.
LOAN TO OFFICER: On February 23, 1999, with the Board of Directors'
approval, the Company provided a $330,000 loan to an officer of the
Company. The loan proceeds were used to purchase 104,000 shares of the
Company common stock on the open market during January and February
1999. The loan is payable on February 23, 2004, and is a full recourse
obligation to the officer collateralized by 154,000 shares of the
Company common stock, which includes 50,000 shares of restricted stock.
The loan currently bears compounded interest at a rate equivalent to the
Company average borrowing rate under its current credit facility.
Accrued interest through 2002 is deferred until maturity. The principal
amount of the loan is deducted from shareholders' equity.
STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM: Under a stock repurchase program, the
Company acquired 70,800 shares of its common stock for $229,000 in 1999.
The Company has not repurchased any shares since 1999, and management does
not expect to repurchase any additional shares in the foreseeable future.                    31            TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED

The Company has foreign operations primarily from TransAct
Technologies Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, which had sales to its
customers of $1,791,000, $11,164,000 and $700,000 in the year ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company had export

2000 and 1999, respectively.
18.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS UNAUDITED
On February 22, 2002, at the request of a major customer, the
Company received a cash payment of approximately $5,800,000 in advance of
printer shipments to be made from March through August 2002. This amount
has been classified as a current liability, and will be reduced by the
sales value of shipments as they are made. As a result of this payment,
the Company repaid all its outstanding revolving borrowings under the
LaSalle Credit Facility in February 2002.
