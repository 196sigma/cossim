To the Board of Directors
Suiza Foods Corporation
Dallas, Texas
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Suiza Foods
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Suiza Foods Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation -- Our consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of our wholly-owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We also
own equity interests of less than 50% in certain companies that we do not
control which are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using
either the equity or cost method of accounting depending on our ownership
interest. Under the equity method of accounting, our investments in these
affiliates are presented as a single amount in our consolidated balance sheets
and our proportional share of their earnings are presented in our consolidated
statements of income as a single line item in other income.
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash Equivalents -- We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with
a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Inventories -- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method, or market. The costs of finished goods
inventories include raw materials, direct labor and indirect production and
overhead costs.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment are stated at
acquisition cost, along with capitalized interest on borrowings during the
actual construction period of major capital projects. Also included in property,
plant and equipment are certain direct costs related to the implementation of
computer software for internal use. Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
follows               ASSET              USEFUL LIFE
Buildings and improvements         Seven to 40 years
Machinery and equipment           Three to 20 years   Capitalized lease assets are amortized over the shorter of their lease term
or their estimated useful lives. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance which
do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed as incurred.
Intangible and Other Assets -- Intangible and other assets include the
following intangibles, which are amortized over their related estimated useful
lives         ASSET                         USEFUL LIFE
Goodwill               Straight-line method over 25 to 40 years
Identifiable intangible assets:
Customer lists           Straight-line method over seven to ten years
Customer supply contracts     Straight-line method over the terms of the agreements primarily 15 years
Trademarks/trade names       Straight-line method over ten to 40 years
Noncompetition agreements     Straight-line method over the terms of the agreements
Patents              Straight-line method over fifteen years
Deferred financing costs       Interest method over the terms of the related debt   We periodically assess the net realizable value of our long-lived assets, as
well as all other assets, by comparing the expected future net operating cash
flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, to the carrying                    F-6

amount of the underlying assets. We would evaluate a potential impairment if the
recorded value of these assets exceeded the associated future net operating cash
flows. Any potential impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which
the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value of assets
would be measured by market value, if an active market exists, or by a forecast
of expected future net operating cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate
with the risk involved.
Foreign Currency Translation -- The financial statements of our foreign
subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency
Translation. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is generally
the local currency of the country. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the
foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at the average rates prevailing during
the year. Changes in exchange rates, which affect cash flows and the related
receivables or payables are recognized as transaction gains and losses in the
determination of net income. The cumulative translation adjustment in
stockholders' equity reflects the unrealized adjustments resulting from
translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries.
Minority Interest in Subsidiaries -- Minority interest in results of
operations of consolidated subsidiaries represents the minority shareholders'
share of the income or loss of various consolidated subsidiaries. The minority
interest in the consolidated balance sheets reflect the original investment by
these minority shareholders in these consolidated subsidiaries, along with their
proportional share of the earnings or losses of these subsidiaries less any
distributions made.
Employee Stock Options and Restricted Stock -- We measure compensation
expense for our stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method and provide the required pro forma disclosures of the effect on net
income and earnings per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied
in measuring compensation expense.
Revenue -- Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped to the
customer. We provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to 30 days,
perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customers and maintain allowances for
potential credit losses based on historical experience.
Income Taxes -- All of our wholly-owned U.S. operating subsidiaries are
included in our consolidated tax return. In addition, our proportional share of
the operations of our majority owned subsidiaries and certain of our equity
method affiliates, which are organized as limited liability companies or limited
partnerships are also included in our consolidated tax return. Our Puerto Rico
and foreign subsidiaries are required to file separate income tax returns in
their local jurisdictions. Certain distributions from these subsidiaries are
subject to U.S. income taxes; however, available tax credits of these
subsidiaries may reduce or eliminate these U.S. income tax liabilities.
Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the
consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
current tax rates. Deferred tax assets, including the benefit of net operating
loss carryforwards, are evaluated based on the guidelines for realization and
may be reduced by a valuation allowance if deemed necessary.
Advertising Expense -- Advertising expense is comprised of media, agency and
production expenses, along with coupon and customer advertising funds.
Advertising expenses are charged to income during the period incurred, except
for expenses related to the development of a major commercial or media campaign
which are charged to income during the period in which the advertisement or
campaign is first presented by the media. Advertising expenses charged to income
totaled $631 million in 2000, $435 million in 1999 and $289 million in 1998.
Additionally, there were no prepaid advertising costs at December 31, 2000 and
such costs were $17 million at December 31, 1999.
Comprehensive Income -- We consider all changes in equity from transactions
and other events and circumstances, except those resulting from investments by
owners and distributions to owners, to be comprehensive income.
Interest Rate Agreements -- Interest rate swaps, caps and floors are entered
into as hedges against interest exposure of our variable rate debt. Differences
between amounts to be paid or received on these interest rate agreements
designated as hedges are included in interest expense as payments are made or
received. Gains or losses on agreements not designated as hedges are included in
income as incurred. Amounts paid to acquire                    F-7
34
interest rate caps and amounts received for interest rate floors are amortized
as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the related agreement.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements -- Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities as amended became effective for us as of January 1, 2001.
All derivatives, which currently consist of only our interest rate agreements,
have been identified pursuant to SFAS No. 133 requirements. We have completed
our documentation and assessment of those derivatives designated as accounting
hedges, all of which were determined to be cash flow hedges. As of the effective
date, we will record the derivative asset or liability related to these cash
flow hedges on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with an offset to
other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective, as required by
SFAS No. 133. Any ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges or fair value hedges will
be recorded as an adjustment to earnings and not other comprehensive income. Our
adoption of this accounting standard as of January 1, 2001 will result in the
recognition of a liability related to our cash flow hedges of $163 million, a
charge, net of income taxes, of $22 million to earnings as the cumulative
effect of the adoption of this new standard and a cumulative effect charge, net
of income taxes, of $96 million to other comprehensive income.
In September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force Task Force of the
Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-10,
Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs, which became effective
for us in the fourth quarter of 2000. This issue requires the disclosure of our
accounting policies for shipping and handling costs and their income statement
classification. Our shipping and handling costs are included in both costs of
sales and selling and distribution expense, depending on the nature of such
costs. Shipping and handling costs in costs of sales include the cost of
shipping products to customers through third party carriers, inventory warehouse
costs and product loading and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs in
selling and distribution expense consist primarily of route delivery costs for
both Company owned delivery routes and independent distributor routes, to the
extent that such independent distributors are paid a delivery fee. These
shipping and handling costs that were recorded as a component of selling and
distribution expense were approximately $6141 million, $3704 million and
$2681 million during 2000, 1999 and 1998 respectively.
The Task Force also reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-14, Accounting for
Certain Sales Incentives, which becomes effective for us in the second quarter
of 2001. This issue addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement
classification of sales incentives that have the effect of reducing the price of
a product or service to a customer at the point of sale. Upon our adoption,
certain sales incentives, which are currently classified as selling and
distribution expenses, will be reclassified as a reduction of sales. Our current
accounting policy for recording sales incentives within the scope of this issue
is to record estimated coupon expense based on historical coupon redemption
experience which is consistent with the requirements of this issue, and we
estimate that the costs of these sales incentives that are recorded as selling
and distribution expenses approximated $43 million, $21 million and $43
million during 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the
prior years' consolidated financial statements to the current year
classifications.
2. ACQUISITIONS
Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a joint venture with Dairy Farmers
of America in which we contributed certain of our domestic fluid dairy
operations with certain of Dairy Farmers of America operations into a newly
formed venture, Suiza Dairy Group, L.P. Dairy Farmers of America is a large
farmers' cooperative from which we purchase a significant portion of our raw
milk. In connection with this transaction, Suiza Dairy Group, L.P. issued
partnership interests to Dairy Farmers of America of approximately $326 million
and made a cash payment to Dairy Farmers of America partner in the amount of
$100 million. Dairy Farmers of America received a 338% ownership interest in
Suiza Dairy Group, L.P., in exchange for the contribution of the operations of
Southern Foods Group which had net sales of approximately $13 billion in 1999,
and for the contribution of its investments in its other joint ventures with us:
Suiza GTL, LLC and Suiza SoCal, LLC. We received a 662% ownership interest in
Suiza Dairy Group, L.P. in exchange for the contribution of our domestic fluid
dairy operations excluding our Puerto Rican operations and our Morningstar
Foods subsidiary. Our ownership interest as well as Dairy Farmers of America
was determined by negotiation between the parties. This transaction was
accounted for as an acquisition by us of Southern Foods Group using the purchase
method of accounting.                    F-8

In total, we completed the acquisitions of 27 dairy businesses and eight
packaging businesses during the last three years which included the following
acquisitions which were significant at the time of completion         DATE             COMPANY          SEGMENT      PURCHASE PRICE

were funded primarily with borrowings under our credit facilities, along with
the issuance in 1999 and 1998 of 77,233 and 2,050,635 shares of our common
stock, respectively, with fair market values of $32 million and $1385 million,
respectively.
All acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting
as of their respective acquisition dates, and accordingly, only the results of
operations of the acquired companies subsequent to their respective acquisition
dates are included in our consolidated financial statements. At the acquisition
date, the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired, including
identifiable intangibles, and liabilities assumed based on their fair market
values. The excess of the total purchase prices over the fair values of the net
assets acquired represented goodwill. In connection with the acquisitions,
assets were acquired and liabilities were assumed, subject to final purchase
price adjustments, as follows                                               YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

sale in 1999 of a majority interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations
discussed in Note 5, do not have a material pro forma impact on net sales,
income from continuing operations or net income for 1999.
Related Party Transactions -- During 2000, 1999 and 1998, we paid fees to a
former officer and director for acquisition consulting services related to
certain completed acquisitions totaling $39 million, $05 million and $51
million, respectively, which have been capitalized as part of the purchase price
of the acquisitions.                    F-9

3. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
Prior to our acquisition of West Lynn Creamery in June 1998, West Lynn
Creamery paid rebates to certain of its customers pursuant to a rebate program
conducted by West Lynn Creamery between 1992 and 1997 the Rebate Program. As
a result of allegations made by one or more of West Lynn customers that West
Lynn conspired with or aided these customers in evading payment of such
customers' federal income taxes through the use of the Rebate Program, the
United States Department of Justice the DOJ conducted an investigation of
this matter. On March 30, 2001, we reached a final settlement of this matter
with the DOJ pursuant to which West Lynn Creamery will plead guilty to one
charge of conspiracy to impede the collection of taxes by the Internal Revenue
Service and will pay $72 million to the government. As a result, we have
recorded a charge of $75 million $50 million net of minority interest in the
fourth quarter of 2000, which includes certain professional fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this matter. This charge is reflected as Litigation
Settlement Costs in our 2000 Consolidated Income Statement, and in Accounts
Payable and Accrued Expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December
31, 2000. 4. EXTRAORDINARY GAINS AND LOSSES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
During the first quarter of 2000 we recognized a $50 million extraordinary
gain, net of income tax expense of $28 million, which included the following
items related to the early extinguishment of our previous senior credit
facility   o  A $65 million gain, net of income tax expense of $36 million, for
interest rate derivatives which became unhedged and were marked to fair
market value, and
o  A $15 million loss, net of an income tax benefit of $08 million, for
the write-off of deferred financing costs.
In the fourth quarter of 1999 we recorded a gain of $09 million, net of
income taxes of $05 million, when contingencies related to the sale of our
packaged ice operations in 1998 were resolved favorably.
On April 30, 1998, we completed the sale of our packaged ice operations for
net cash proceeds of approximately $1727 million. We reported an extraordinary
gain of $355 million from the sale of this operation, net of $220 million of
income tax expense. Our packaged ice segment had revenues of approximately $179
million during the four months ended April 30, 1998. The results of discontinued
operations includes interest expense of $24 million during 1998. Interest
charges allocated to discontinued operations are based on debt specifically
attributed to our packaged ice operations. The results of discontinued
operations are presented net of the related income tax benefit of $21 million
in 1998.
In 1998, an extraordinary loss of $38 million, net of a $23 million income
tax benefit, was also recognized in connection with the early extinguishment of
the term loan of our previous senior credit facility, and included losses from
the write-off of deferred financing costs and interest rate swap losses.
5. INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
Investment in Consolidated Container Company LLC -- On July 2, 1999, we sold
a majority interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations to Consolidated
Container Company, which through a predecessor owned another plastic packaging
business. Pursuant to this transaction, we received a 431% common equity
interest in Consolidated Container Company in exchange for our common equity
interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations, along with cash of
approximately $3640 million in connection with Consolidated Container Company
refinancing of the intercompany debt and preferred stock investment that our
U.S. plastic packaging operations owed us. As a part of this transaction the
senior secured notes of Plastic Containers, Inc., a former subsidiary of
Continental Can, were assumed by Consolidated Container Company.                    F-10
37
With the consummation of this transaction, the assets and liabilities and
results of operations of our formerly consolidated U.S. plastic packaging
operations were combined with those of Consolidated Container Company and were
eliminated from our consolidated financial statements. For all periods prior to
this date, our U.S. plastic packaging operations continue to be included in our
consolidated financial statements. Included in consolidated sales for the first
six months of 1999 and for all of 1998 were sales of $2450 million and $3320
million, respectively, related to the U.S. plastic packaging operations.
Our investment in Consolidated Container Company after July 2, 1999 is
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our investment in
Consolidated Container Company was $237 million and $39 million at December
31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our initial investment, as adjusted, was lower
than our proportional share of Consolidated Container Company net assets by
$1004 million which is being amortized over forty years. Earnings from our
unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income include $113
million and $24 million net of restructuring and other non-recurring charges
of $08 million and $49 million attributable to Consolidated Container
Company, of which $26 million and $14 million are attributable to the
amortization of the difference between the carrying amount of our investment and
our proportional share of our underlying equity interest in their net assets for
the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Although the market
value of our investment in Consolidated Container Company is not readily
determinable, we believe that the fair value of this investment exceeds its
carrying amount.
Summarized financial information for Consolidated Container Company at
December 31, 2000 and 1999 and for the periods ended December 31, 2000 and 1999
is as follows                             DECEMBER 31,

136% and 138% interest in Horizon Organic, respectively. We account for this
investment under the equity method of accounting as we believe that we have the
ability to influence the operating policies of Horizon. The quoted stock price
ranged from $400 to $1225 during 2000. The closing stock price on December 31,
2000 was $444 per share, resulting in a market value of our investment of $59
million. Our investment in Horizon Organic at December 31, 2000 and 1999 was
$164 million and $162 million, respectively, and our equity in earnings
included in our consolidated statement of income for both 2000 and 1999 was $02
million.

Terminated Senior Credit Facility -- In connection with our acquisition of
Southern Foods Group effective January 1, 2000, we replaced our then existing
senior credit facility with two new facilities, as described under Parent-Level
Credit Facility and Suiza Dairy Group Credit Facility below.
Parent-Level Credit Facility -- Effective January 1, 2000 we entered into a
new parent credit facility, which replaced our then existing senior credit
facility. The new facility, which expires in January 2005, provides us with a
revolving line of credit of up to $300 million to be used for general corporate
and working capital purposes, including the financing of future acquisitions. As
of December 31, 2000, no funds were borrowed under this facility, but there were
$40 million of issued but undrawn letters of credit outstanding. See Credit
Facility Terms below for a description of the terms of the parent credit
facility.
Suiza Dairy Group Credit Facility -- Simultaneous with the closing of our
acquisition of Southern Foods Group, Suiza Dairy Group entered into a new $161
billion credit facility with a group of lenders which expires in January 2005.
The Suiza Dairy Group credit facility provides an $805 million revolving line of
credit, a $625 million term loan and a $180 million term loan. At closing, Suiza
Dairy Group borrowed approximately $11 billion under this facility and
distributed a portion of the borrowings to us and to Dairy Farmers of America.
We used our portion of the distribution to repay our then existing senior credit
facility and certain other obligations. At December 31, 2000, there were
outstanding borrowings of $1095 billion under this facility, in addition to
$178 million of issued but undrawn letters of credit. See Credit Facility
Terms below for a description of the terms of the Suiza Dairy Group credit
facility.
Credit Facility Terms -- Amounts outstanding under the Suiza Dairy Group
credit facility and our parent-level credit facility bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to one of the following rates, at our option   o  a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis
points or the prime rate, plus a margin that varies from 25 to 125
basis points for the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and 0 to 75
basis points on the new parent credit facility, depending on our ratio
of defined indebtedness to EBITDA or
o  the London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR computed as LIBOR divided
by the product of one minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage, plus a
margin that varies from 125 to 225 basis points for the Suiza Dairy
Group credit facility and 75 to 175 basis points on the new parent
credit facility, depending on our ratio of defined indebtedness to
EBITDA.
The interest rate in effect on the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility,
including the applicable interest rate margin, was 850% at December 31, 2000.
Interest is payable quarterly or at the end of the applicable interest period.
Scheduled principal payments on the $625 million term loan are due in the
following installments   o  $250 million quarterly from March 31, 2001 through December 31, 2001   o  $3125 million quarterly from March 31, 2002 through December 31, 2002   o  $375 million quarterly from March 31, 2003 through December 31, 2003   o  25% of the outstanding balance up to $50 million quarterly on each of
March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004; and the                    F-14
41   o  Remaining balance on January 4, 2005.
No principal payments are due on the $805 million line of credit and the
$180 million term loan until maturity on January 4, 2005.
In consideration for the revolving commitments, we pay a commitment fee on
unused amounts of the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and the parent-level
credit facility that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points, based on our ratio of
indebtedness to EBITDA as defined in the agreement.
The Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and the parent-level credit facility
contain various financial and other restrictive covenants and requirements that
we maintain certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio computed as
the ratio of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of defined indebtedness
to EBITDA, as defined separately by each agreement and an interest coverage
ratio computed as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense as defined separately
by each agreement. In addition, both facilities require that we maintain a
minimum level of net worth as defined separately by each agreement. The
facilities also contain limitations on liens, investments, the incurrence of
additional indebtedness and acquisitions, and prohibit certain dispositions of
property and restrict certain payments, including dividends. The credit
facilities are secured by capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries.
Receivable-Backed Loan - On June 30, 2000 we entered into a $150 million
credit facility secured by certain subsidiary accounts receivable. Pursuant to
this transaction, we pledged receivables to a multi-seller asset-backed conduit
sponsored by a major financial institution. We used the portion of the proceeds
attributable to Suiza Dairy Group and its subsidiaries to pay down higher cost
borrowings under the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility. The loan bears interest
at a variable rate based on the commercial paper yield as defined in the
agreement. The interest rate on the receivable-backed loan at December 31, 2000
was 713%. In February 2001, we increased our receivable-backed loan from $150
million to $175 million, and used the proceeds to pay down higher-cost
borrowings under the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility.
Foreign Subsidiary Term Loan - In connection with our acquisition of Leche
Celta, in February 2000, our Spanish subsidiary obtained a 7 billion peseta
non-recourse loan from a Spanish lender, all of which was borrowed at closing
and used to finance a portion of the purchase price. The loan, which is secured
by the stock of Leche Celta, will expire on February 21, 2007, bears interest at
a variable rate based on the ratio of Leche Celta debt to EBITDA as defined
in the corresponding loan agreement, and requires semi-annual principal
payments beginning in August 2001. The interest rate in effect on this loan at
December 31, 2000 was 713%.
Uncommitted Line of Credit - On October 4, 2000, Suiza Dairy Group entered
into an agreement with First Union National Bank pursuant to which Suiza Dairy
Group may borrow up to $200 million from time to time on an uncommitted basis.
Loans outstanding under the agreement are unsecured and bear interest at a
floating rate of interest, adjusted daily. There is no commitment fee associated
with this facility. Principal amounts borrowed under this agreement will mature
one year from the date of the agreement. On December 31, 2000, Suiza Dairy Group
had an outstanding balance of $200 million under this line of credit at an
interest rate of 856%.
Other Lines of Credit - Leche Celta, our Spanish subsidiary, is our only
subsidiary with a currently outstanding line of credit separate from the credit
facilities described above. Leche Celta existing line of credit, which is in
the principal amount of 25 billion pesetas, was obtained on July 12, 2000 in
replacement of a pre-existing line of credit, bears interest at a variable
interest rate based on the ratio of Leche Celta debt to EBITDA as defined in
the corresponding loan agreement, is secured by our stock in Leche Celta and
will expire in June 2007. No funds were drawn on this line of credit at December
31, 2000. Our French and German subsidiaries, which we sold in March and May
2000, respectively, also had lines of credit. Those lines of credit were
terminated upon completion of the divestitures.
Industrial Development Revenue Bonds - Certain of our subsidiaries have
revenue bonds outstanding which require annual sinking fund redemptions
aggregating $07 million and are secured by irrevocable letters of credit issued
by financial institutions, along with first mortgages on certain real property
and equipment. Interest on these bonds is due semiannually at interest rates
that vary based on market conditions which, at December 31, 2000 ranged from
520% to 545%.
Other Subsidiary Debt - Other subsidiary debt includes various promissory
notes for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment and capital lease
obligations. The various promissory notes payable provide for interest at                    F-15
42 varying rates and are payable in monthly installments of principal and interest
until maturity, when the remaining principal balances are due. Capital lease
obligations represent machinery and equipment financing obligations which are
payable in monthly installments of principal and interest and are collateralized
by the related assets financed.
Southern Foods Group, which we acquired in January 2000, had $1138 million
principal amount of 9 7/8% senior notes outstanding when we completed our
acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, we were required to offer to
repurchase these senior notes at 101% of face value. All senior notes were
tendered and were redeemed on March 24, 2000.
Scheduled Maturities -- The scheduled maturities of long-term debt, which
include capitalized lease obligations, at December 31, 2000, were as follows in
thousands

Interest Rate Agreements - We have interest rate derivative agreements in
place, including interest rate swaps and collars, that have been designated as
hedges against our variable interest rate exposure on our loans under the Suiza
Dairy Group credit facility.
These derivative agreements provided hedges for loans under our Suiza Dairy
Group credit facility by limiting or fixing the LIBOR interest rates specified
in the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility at the interest rates noted below until
the indicated expiration dates of these interest rate derivative agreements.
The following table summarizes our various interest rate agreements as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999                                              NOTIONAL AMOUNT

December 2002 and June 2003     100,000    100,000   These derivative agreements were previously designated as hedges for
borrowings under our terminated senior credit facility. In connection with the
repayment of amounts owed under our terminated senior credit facility these
derivative agreements were marked to fair market value, which resulted in a gain
of $65 million, net of income taxes, which, along with a loss from the
write-off of unamortized deferred loan costs related to this facility was
reported as an extraordinary gain from the extinguishment of debt during the
first quarter of 2000. These derivative agreements have been redesignated as
hedges under the Suiza Dairy Group credit facility and their recorded asset
value is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lives of
the respective agreements. The amortization is reported as a component of total
consolidated interest expense. For a discussion of the treatment of derivative
agreements effective January 1, 2001 see Note 1 - Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements.
We have also entered into certain additional interest rate swap agreements
with a notional amount of $5500 million in the fourth quarter of 2000, which
are intended to provide hedges against variable interest rate exposure on loans
under Suiza Dairy Group credit facility. These agreements, which became
effective January 2, 2001, are interest rate swaps with an interest range of
644% to 678% expiring between December 2001 and December 2006.
We have also entered into interest rate swap agreements that provide hedges
for loans under Leche Celta term loan. The following table summarizes these

We are exposed to market risk under these arrangements due to the
possibility of interest rates on the credit facilities falling below the rates
on our interest rate derivative agreements. Credit risk under these arrangements
is remote since the counterparties to our interest rate derivative agreements
are major financial institutions.
12. MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE TRUST ISSUED PREFERRED SECURITIES
In connection with our acquisition of Land-O-Sun in February 1998, we issued
$100 million of company-obligated 5% mandatorily redeemable convertible
preferred securities of a Delaware business trust. On January 4, 2000, in
connection with the Southern Foods transaction, we redeemed the 5% mandatorily
redeemable convertible preferred securities in the amount of $100,638,889, which
includes the principal repayment and accrued interest.
On March 24, 1998, we also completed the sale of $600 million of
company-obligated 55% mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities
of a Delaware business trust in a private placement to qualified institutional
buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 55%
preferred securities mature 30 years from the date of issue. These trust issued
preferred securities, which are recorded net of related fees and expenses, are
convertible at the option of the holders into an aggregate of approximately 77
million shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment in certain
circumstances. These preferred securities are also redeemable, at our option, at
any time after three years from their issue date at specified amounts and are
mandatorily redeemable at their liquidation preference amount of $50 per share
at maturity or upon occurrence of certain specified events.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Our authorized shares of capital stock include 1,000,000 shares of preferred
stock and 500,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $01 per share.
Preferred Stock -- The rights and preferences of preferred stock are
established by our Board of Directors upon issuance. The Series A preferred
stock previously outstanding represented 11,691 shares of preferred stock with a
stated and redemption value of $32000 per share, provided for cumulative
dividends at a rate of 8% and was redeemable only at our option. On September
29, 1998, we redeemed all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock for the
stated value of $32000 per share, plus accumulated unpaid dividends, for a
total cost of $38 million.
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plans -- We have stock options and shares
of restricted stock outstanding under three plans. Only one of these plans has
shares remaining available for issuance. This plan, the Suiza Foods Corporation
1997 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan, provides for grants of stock
options and restricted stock to employees, officers, directors and consultants
to acquire 75 million shares. Exercise prices of stock options will approximate
or be above fair market value on the grant date. The options vest in accordance
with provisions set forth in the applicable option agreements.                    F-17

15. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS
We sponsor various defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
plans, including various employee savings and profit sharing plans, and
contribute to various multi-employer pension plans on behalf of our employees.
Substantially all full-time union and non-union employees who have completed one
or more years of service and have met other requirements pursuant to the plans
are eligible to participate in these plans. During 2000, 1999 and 1998, our
retirement and profit sharing plan expenses were as follows                                YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

based on years of service and employee compensation. Our funding policy is to
contribute annually the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations. Plan
assets consist principally of investments made with insurance companies under a
group annuity contract.                    F-20

to the disposed U.S. packaging operations.
Defined Contribution Plans -- Certain of our non-union personnel may elect
to participate in savings and profit sharing plans sponsored by us. These plans
generally provide for salary reduction contributions to the plans on behalf of
the participants of between 10% and 170% of a participant annual
compensation and provide for employer matching and profit sharing contributions
as determined by our Board of Directors. In addition, certain                    F-21
48
union hourly employees are participants in company-sponsored defined
contribution plans which provide for employer contributions in various amounts
ranging from $21 to $39 per pay period per participant.
Multi-Employer Pension Plans -- Certain of our subsidiaries contribute to
various multi-employer union pension plans, which are administered jointly by
management and union representatives and cover substantially all full-time and
certain part-time union employees who are not covered by our other plans. The
Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 amended ERISA to establish
funding requirements and obligations for employers participating in
multi-employer plans, principally related to employer withdrawal from or
termination of such plans. We could, under certain circumstances, be liable for
unfunded vested benefits or other expenses of jointly administered
union/management plans. At this time, we have not established any liabilities
because withdrawal from these plans is not probable or reasonably possible.
16. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS
Certain of our subsidiaries provide health care benefits to certain retirees
who are covered under specific group contracts. As defined by the specific group
contract, qualified covered associates may be eligible to receive major medical
insurance with deductible and coinsurance provisions subject to certain lifetime
maximums.

49 17. PLANT CLOSING AND OTHER COSTS
Plant closing costs -- As part of an overall integration and cost reduction
strategy, we recorded plant closing and other non-recurring costs during 2000
and 1999 in the amount of $34 million and $126 million, respectively. In
addition, our share of Consolidated Container restructuring charges were
income of $08 million in 2000 and expenses of $49 million during 1999. These
amounts were reported as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates.
The charges recorded for our integration and cost reduction programs in 2000
reflect several approved efficiency and integration efforts including
restructuring of our corporate office departments, elimination of a production
shift and certain maintenance activities at our Puerto Rican operation, and
closing of our Hartford, Connecticut plant.
During 1999, we recorded charges related to the closing of four plants with
consolidation of production into other plants, the disposition of a small cheese
processing plant, consolidation of administrative offices within one of our
regions and severance costs incurred at the corporate office as well as the
European and Puerto Rican operations.
The principal components of the plans approved during 2000 and 1999 include
the following   o  Workforce reduction as a result of plant closings, plant
rationalizations and consolidation of administrative functions. The
plans included an overall reduction of 205 people in 2000 and 315
people in 1999, primarily plant employees associated with the plant
closings and rationalization. The costs were charged to our earnings in
the period that the plan was established in detail and employee
severance and benefits had been appropriately communicated. All except
six employees had been severed as of December 31, 2000.
o  Shutdown costs include those costs that are necessary to prepare the
plant facilities for closure.
o  Additional costs to be incurred after shutdown included lease
obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after
shutdown of the plant.
o  Write-downs of property, plant and equipment and other assets are
primarily for asset impairments as a result of facilities that are no
longer used in operations. The impairments relate primarily to owned
building, land and equipment at the facilities which are being sold and
were written down to their estimated fair value.
Activity with respect to the plant closing and other non-recurring costs for
2000 is summarized below                             BALANCE AT                BALANCE AT

There have not been significant adjustments to the plan and the majority of
future cash requirements to reduce the liability at December 31, 2000 are
expected to be completed within a year.
Acquired facility closing costs -- As part of our purchase price
allocations, we accrued costs in 2000 and 1999 pursuant to plans to exit certain
activities and operations of acquired businesses in order to rationalize
production and reduce costs and inefficiencies. Several plants were closed in
connection with our acquisitions of Broughton Foods, New England Dairies and
Southern Foods. Production from these plants was moved to our other facilities.
The principal components of the plans include the following   o  Workforce reduction as a result of plant closings included an overall
reduction of 282 and 340 plant personnel during 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The costs incurred were charged against our acquisition
liabilities for these costs. All except 35 employees had been
terminated as of December 31, 2000.
o  Shutdown costs include those costs that are necessary to clean and
prepare the plant facilities for closure.
o  Additional costs to be incurred after shutdown included lease
obligations or termination costs, utilities and property taxes after
shutdown of the plant.

Leases -- We lease certain property, plant and equipment used in our
operations under both capital and operating lease agreements. Such leases, which
are primarily for machinery and equipment and vehicles, have lease terms ranging
from one to 20 years. Certain of the operating lease agreements require the
payment of additional rentals for maintenance, along with additional rentals
based on miles driven or units produced. Rent expense, including additional
rent, was $669 million, $451 million and $480 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
The composition of capital leases which are reflected as property, plant and
equipment in our consolidated balance sheets are as follows                               DECEMBER 31,

20. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Pursuant to SFAS No. 107, Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, we are required to disclose an estimate of the fair value of our
financial instruments as of December 31, 2000 and 1999. SFAS No. 107 defines the
fair value of financial instruments as the amount at which the instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Due to their near-term maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts
receivable and accounts payable are considered equivalent to fair value. In
addition, because the interest rates on our senior credit facility and most
other debt are variable, their fair values approximate their carrying values.
We have entered into various interest rate agreements to reduce our
sensitivity to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. The fair
values of these instruments were determined based on current values for similar
instruments with similar terms. The following table presents the carrying value
and fair value of our interest rate agreements at December 31                           2000                   1999

21. BUSINESS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Prior to the third quarter of 1999, we had two reportable segments,
including dairy and packaging. As a result of the sale of a majority
interest in our U.S. plastic packaging operations effective July 2, 1999, as
discussed in Note 5, we no longer have a reportable packaging segment under
current accounting rules. Our two European packaging businesses have been
included in the packaging segment until their disposition in March and May 2000.
Effective with the acquisition of Southern Foods Group and the formation of
Suiza Dairy Group we began a realignment of our businesses which has resulted in
the separation of our previous dairy segment into two reportable segments: Suiza
Dairy Group and Morningstar Foods. Our Suiza Dairy Group segment, which consists
of Suiza Dairy Group, L.P., manufactures and distributes fluid milk, ice cream
and novelties, half-and-half and whipping cream, sour cream, cottage cheese, and
yogurt as well as fruit juices and other flavored drinks and bottled water.
Morningstar Foods, which consists of our wholly-owned subsidiary Morningstar
Foods Inc., manufactures dairy and non-dairy coffee creamers, whipping cream and
pre-whipped toppings, specialty products such as lactose-reduced milk and soy
milk, as well as certain refrigerated and extended shelf-life products. Our
Puerto Rico and Spanish operations do not meet the definition of a segment and

the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on
operating profit not including nonrecurring gains and losses and foreign
exchange gains and losses.

there are no significant noncash items other than depreciation and amortization
in reported profit or loss. The amounts in the following tables are the amounts

22. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED
The table set forth below is a summary of the unaudited quarterly results of
operations for 2000 and 1999 in thousands, except per share data. As a result
of the sale of our U.S. packaging operations to Consolidated Container Company
on July 2, 1999 in exchange for cash and a 431% interest in Consolidated
Container Company, the sales, gross profit and operating expenses of this
operation subsequent to July 2, 1999 are not included in the table but are
instead consolidated onto a single line, equity in earnings of unconsolidated
affiliates within income from continuing operations.                                        QUARTER
