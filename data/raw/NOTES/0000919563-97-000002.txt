management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of MotivePower Industries, Inc.

Formerly known as MK Rail Corporation
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.    Organization, Operations and Basis of Accounting
The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of
MotivePower Industries, Inc. the Company, formerly known as MK Rail
Corporation, formed in April 1993, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Morrison Knudsen Corporation Morrison Knudsen. The Company acquired certain
assets of the Rail Systems Group of Morrison Knudsen, including the Locomotive
Division, which have been included in the financial statements for all periods
presented on a pooling-of-interests basis for entities under common control.
On April 26, 1994, the Company, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Morrison Knudsen, commenced an initial public offering of 6 million shares of
its Common Stock at an offering price of $16 a share which decreased Morrison
Knudsen interest in the Company to 65%. Effective as of September 11, 1996, as
part of its bankruptcy plan, Morrison Knudsen distributed all of its ownership
in the Company to its creditors and certain of its then current stockholders.
Morrison Knudsen is no longer a stockholder in the Company.
The Company and its subsidiaries design, manufacture and distribute
engineered  locomotive  components and parts;  provide  locomotive  fleet
maintenance,  overhauling and remanufacturing locomotives; and manufacture
environmentally friendly switcher, commuter and mid-range DC traction, diesel
electric and liquefied natural gas locomotives up to 4,000 horsepower. The
consolidated financial statements include the following Subsidiaries Wholly Owned:
Boise Locomotive Company Boise Locomotive,  formed in 1972, performs
locomotive remanufacturing, overhauling and manufacturing as its principal
business.
Clark Industries Company Clark, acquired in 1993, is a manufacturer of
cylinder heads, pistons and liner assemblies.
Engine Systems Company, Inc. formerly known as MK Engine Systems Company, Inc.
Engine Systems, formed in 1994, remanufactures turbochargers for locomotive,
industrial and marine engines.
MK Gain S.A. de C.V. MK Gain, a Mexican variable stock corporation formed in
1994, performs locomotive fleet maintenance as its principal business, almost
exclusively for one customer, Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico Mexican
National Railway.
Motor Coils Manufacturing Company Motor Coils, acquired in 1991, is a
remanufacturer of locomotive traction motors and a manufacturer of rotating
electrical components.
Power Parts Company Power Parts, acquired in 1992, is a supplier of new and
replacement engine and nonengine parts for locomotives.
28 Touchstone  Company  Touchstone,  acquired  in  1994,  manufactures,
remanufactures and distributes  locomotive radiators,  oil coolers, brake
adjusters and other industrial heat exchangers.
Affiliates:
MK Rail Systems of Argentina, S.A., the Company 19% investment in Morrison
Knudsen Rail Systems of Argentina, S.A. MKRSA, is accounted for by the cost
method and has been valued at zero.
Trenes de Buenos Aires S.A. TBA, a 19%-owned affiliate which operates a
concession contract to operate the Mitre and Sarmiento railway passenger lines
in Buenos Aires is accounted for by the cost method and has been valued at zero.
On July 6, 1995, the Company sold its interest in Morrison Knudsen of
Australia, Ltd. MKA to Morrison Knudsen. In consideration, the Company
received a nominal cash payment and MKA redeemable preferred stock bearing a
9% cumulative dividend. The Company has valued this stock at zero.
On October 25, 1996, the Company sold substantially all of the assets
of the Company Power Parts Sign Co. Sign for $13 million plus the
assumption of certain trade payables. In addition, on July 26, 1996, the Company
sold substantially all of the assets of the Company Alert Manufacturing and
Supply Co. Alert for $39 million plus the assumption of trade payables of
$750,000. The Company recorded gains of $783,000 and $700,000 on the sale of the
assets of Sign and Alert, respectively.
2.    Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries. Sales
between the Company and its subsidiaries are billed at prices consistent with
sales to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in
affiliates in which the Company ownership is less than 20% are accounted for
using the cost method.
Revenue  Recognition:  The Company  recognizes  revenues  on  locomotive
remanufacturing  and  manufacturing  contracts  on  the  percentage  of
completion-units delivered method, and on component part sales when product is
shipped to the customer. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and
revised periodically and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period when
known. Provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted
contracts. Unbilled accounts receivable represent shipments for which invoices
have not been processed.
Revenue recognized on the MK Gain long-term maintenance contract is
based upon a percentage of the expected gross margin. Under the terms of the
maintenance contract, significant costs are incurred in the early years
locomotive overhauls and fleet normalization, while payments from the customer
remain relatively constant throughout the life of the contract. By using a
percentage of the expected gross margin to recognize revenue under the
maintenance contract appropriate consideration is given to the risks associated
with the contract.  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings
Underbillings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings
Overbillings on the contract in progress are recorded on the balance sheet
and are classified as current or non-current based upon the expected timing of
their realization or liquidation.
29     Remanufactured locomotives are warranted for a period from one to three
years, and component parts are warranted for a period from one to four years.
Additionally, the Company provides an overhaul reserve on owned locomotives.
Estimated costs for product warranty are recognized at the time the products are
sold. Overhaul reserves are recorded on a straight-line basis over the period of
time from acquisition of the locomotive to the estimated date of the related
overhaul. Warranty and overhaul reserves of $71 million and $44 million at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively, are included in accrued expenses in
the consolidated balance sheets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Cash Equivalents: Cash equivalents consist of investments in highly liquid debt
securities having an original maturity of three months or less. Such securities
are considered to be held to maturity.
Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Locomotive
inventories under long-term contracts consist of actual direct material, labor
and manufacturing overhead and are allocated to individual units based on the
estimated average production costs of units to be produced under a contract.
Locomotive inventories under contract were $35 million and $25 million at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Component part inventories are valued
at purchase cost using the last-in first-out LIFO method or average production
cost.
Credit Risks: Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations  of credit risk consist of cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one financial institution and places its investments with financial institutions
that the Company believes are financially sound. The Company provides its
products and services to the Class I Railroads in North America, to metropolitan
transit and commuter rail authorities, to Amtrak, to original equipment
manufacturers and to other customers internationally. A relatively small number
of customers has represented a significant percentage of the Company revenues
in most years. Collectively, the Company top five customers accounted for 63 62%, and 57% of sales in the years ended December 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers
and their accounts with the Company. The Company historically has not incurred
any significant credit-related losses.
Locomotive Lease Fleet: Equipment on operating leases includes the Company
locomotive lease fleet. The locomotives are depreciated on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives of five to 15 years. Cost and accumulated
depreciation  at December 31, 1996 were $36 million and $15 million,
respectively. Cost and accumulated depreciation at December 31, 1995 were $179
million and $31 million, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment: Buildings and improvements and machinery and
equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over
periods from three to 30 years. The cost and accumulated depreciation associated
with property and equipment that is disposed of are removed from the
30 accounts, and gains or losses from such disposals are included in income.
Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method
over the terms of the related leases. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance
are charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles: Goodwill and other intangibles consist of the
following     Goodwill - Cost in excess of tangible assets of businesses acquired in
purchase transactions is amortized on the straight-line method over 15
years from the date of acquisition. The unamortized cost of goodwill
was $178 million at December 31, 1996 and $195 million at December
31, 1995.
Covenants Not To Compete - These agreements are recorded at cost and
amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of the agreements.
Terms of the agreements range from three to 10 years. The unamortized
cost was $45 million at December 31, 1996 and $53 million at December
31, 1995.
Loan Origination Fees - These fees are associated with the origination
of the Company debt. The fees are recorded at cost and amortized on
the straight-line method over the terms of the respective loan
agreements. The unamortized cost was $21 million at December 31, 1996
and $25 million at December 31, 1995.
Patent Costs - Patent costs related to proprietary technology have been
deferred and are amortized on the straight-line method over three
years. The unamortized cost was $217,000 at December 31, 1996 and
$417,000 at December 31, 1995.
Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $80 million
and $41 million, respectively. The Company evaluates the realization of
intangible assets on a quarterly basis and adjusts, if necessary, the carrying
value or useful life accordingly.
Research and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred and include research and development  expenses for new product
development and costs to improve existing products. The Company does not engage
in research and development activities in the normal course of business, but
rather in point of use engineering.
Foreign Currency Translation: During 1995, due to changes in the sourcing of
component parts to U.S. suppliers at MK Gain and the U.S. dollar-denominated
financing secured by MK Gain in 1995, it was determined that MK Gain
functional currency was the U.S. dollar and not the Mexican peso. As a result,
MK Gain remeasures monetary assets and liabilities at year end exchange rates
and inventory, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical
rates. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at the average rates in effect
during the year, except that depreciation, amortization and cost of sales are
remeasured at historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the remeasurement are
included in the result of operations as they occur. Gains and losses resulting
from foreign currency transactions are
31 included in income based upon the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52 Foreign Currency Translation. MK Gain has a contract
that provides for escalation adjustments to the base contract based upon, among
other things, changes in the exchange rate. Such escalation adjustments are
included in revenues when realized.
Income Taxes: The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and foreign
income taxes currently payable and those deferred or prepaid because of
temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets
and liabilities. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between the financial statement amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect in the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company has recorded
a net deferred tax asset of $20 million reflecting the benefit of $71 million in
loss carryforwards, which expire in varying amounts between 2004 and 2010.
Realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to
expiration of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset
will be realized.
Asset Impairment: In March 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of SFAS 121 was issued. The Company adopted SFAS 121
on January 1, 1996. Adoption of SFAS 121 did not have an effect on the Company
financial position or results of operations.
Stock-based Compensation: In October 1995, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123 was
issued. SFAS 123 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal years that
begin after December 15, 1995. The Company adopted SFAS 123 on January 1, 1996,
and as permitted by that standard the Company retained the recognition
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion Number 25. Adoption of SFAS
123 did not have an impact on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities: In October 1996, the American Institute
of Certified  Public  Accountants  issued  Statement  of Position  96-1,
Environmental Remediation Liabilities SOP 96-1. SOP 96-1 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1996. The Company believes that its
liabilities have been recorded in compliance with SOP 96-1 and, therefore,
implementation of SOP 96-1 will have no impact on the Company financial
position or results of operations.
Reclassifications: Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1995 and 1994
financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

As a continuation of the restructuring plan of the Company, which began
in early 1996, charges were incurred due to the impairment of certain assets,
facility rationalization and the restructuring of lease commitments.
Year Ended December 31, 1995
Charges for Unusual Items in 1995 were incurred principally due to the
Company exit from the high-horsepower locomotive manufacturing business, the
writedown of the Mountaintop production facility, the impairment of the
locomotive lease fleet and the disposition of the Company  Australian
operations. These charges were incurred as part of the Company restructuring
plan, which would allow the Company to concentrate efforts on its core
businesses.
Year Ended December 31, 1994
Charges for Unusual Items in 1994 were incurred due to losses on
high-horsepower  locomotive manufacturing,  contract losses for locomotive
remanufacturing, maintenance contracts, and losses on certain contracts in
Australia, the restructuring and disposition of Argentine operations and legal
costs incurred in connection with stockholder litigation. In 1994, the Company
experienced significant operational and financial management turnover and
incurred charges to provide for the losses on previously underbid contracts and
the decision to terminate manufacturing operations in Argentina.                    33 4.    Inventories

7.    Indebtedness
In August 1995, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a $75
million loan agreement the Loan Agreement with BankAmerica Business Credit
BABC which provided for revolving borrowings based on the amounts of
eligible accounts receivable, inventory, and certain other assets which,
together with property, plant and equipment,  collateralized the amounts
borrowed.
The Loan Agreement was modified several times during 1995 and 1996 to
revise covenants, provide for term borrowings, and various other provisions and,
on September 10, 1996, was amended and renamed the Amended and Restated Loan and
Security Agreement the Restated Agreement. On December 31, 1996, the
Restated Agreement was modified to effect reductions in rates on borrowings,
reinstate the Company ability to convert borrowings to LIBOR-based rather than
base-rate loans, and to provide for a September 30, 1997 termination date for
the Restated Agreement at which time all outstanding principal and interest
would become due. In connection with the modifications to the Restated
Agreement, the Company repaid amounts owed certain participating lenders who are
no longer lenders under the Restated Agreement, as modified, and paid early
termination  fees to those lenders.  The early  termination fees and a
proportionate unamortized portion of previously incurred deferred debt issuance
costs were expensed as an extraordinary item of $1,751,000 in the 1996 statement
of operations.
Under the terms of the Restated Agreement, as modified, the interest
rate on amounts drawn under the revolving portion of the facility was reduced to
the base rate plus 5% as compared to the prior rate of the base rate plus
15%, and the rate on the term loan portion of the facility was reduced to the
base rate plus 75% compared to the prior rate of the base rate plus 175%.
Additionally, the modifications enabled the Company to convert revolving
base-rate borrowings to LIBOR-based borrowings at LIBOR plus 2%. Under both the
Loan Agreement and the Restated Agreement, the Company was required to pay a
monthly fee based on the unused portion of its borrowing capacity. At December
31, 1996 and 1995, balances outstanding under the Restated Agreement and Loan
Agreement were $298 million and $598 million, respectively, and unused
borrowing  capacity at those dates was $228 million and $31 million,
respectively. The interest rates in effect on amounts borrowed at Decmber 31,
1996 ranged from 875% to 900%, and at December 31,1995 was 10%.
The Restated Agreement provides for a maximum of $10 million of letters
of credit, of which approximately $43 million was outstanding at December 31,
1996. The Company pays a monthly fee of 15% per annum on the undrawn amount of
outstanding letters of credit.
The Restated  Agreement provides certain  restrictive  covenants,
including attaining a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, fixed charge
coverage, limitations on capital expenditures, restrictions on the payment of
dividends and other financial covenants.
In November 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Emerging
Issues Task Force reached a consensus on issue number 95-22, Balance Sheet
Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements that
Include both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box ArrangementEITF
95-22. In accordance with EITF 95-22, the Company has classified the balance
of the revolving loans due under the Loan Agreement as current.
On February 27, 1997, the Company and a syndicate of lenders led by
Bank of America NT and SA entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement to replace the Company Restated Agreement with BABC. The facility
consists of a $20 million amortizing term loan and a $55 million revolving
credit line including a $15 million letter of credit subfacility. The entire $75
million facility is for a term of four years and is collateralized by
substantially all of the domestic assets of the Company. Interest rate spreads
charged under the new facility will reset at the end of each quarter based on
the ratio of the Company quarter-ending debt to trailing 12-month cash flow.
Both base rate and LIBOR
34 borrowings are available, at the Company discretion. Interest rates range from
LIBOR plus 050% to LIBOR plus 20%, and base rate plus 00% to base rate plus
10%. For the first six months of the facility, interest rates may not go below
LIBOR plus 10% for LIBOR-based borrowings, and base rate plus 00% for base
rate borrowings.
On July 6, 1995, MK Gain entered into a $30 million loan agreement the
Agreement with Bancomer, S.A. Bancomer, a Mexican bank. Under the
Agreement, Bancomer will advance up to $30 million to finance 85% of the
purchase price of U.S.-manufactured locomotive parts and components exported to
Mexico for use in the overhaul of locomotives in connection with the Mexican
National Railway contract. Each advance under the Agreement is subject to
interest at the Funding Rate 59180% to 60625% at December 31, 1996, as
defined in the Agreement plus 25%. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
CIBC has agreed to fund Bancomer in connection with this transaction. The
Export-Import Bank of the United States Eximbank has issued a credit
guarantee which covers repayment risk between Bancomer and CIBC. Upon funding,
Eximbank receives, from MK Gain, an Exposure Fee equal to 414% of each advance
under the Agreement.
Advances under the Agreement will be drawn over a period of up to 36
months from July 6, 1995 as documents evidencing MK Gain receipt of U.S.
exports are presented to the satisfaction of Bancomer, CIBC and Eximbank.
Principal and interest payments on each advance are to be made in 10 semi-annual
installments due on May 15 and November 15 of each year with interest payments
beginning May 15, 1996 and principal payments beginning November 15, 1996. The
Agreement provides for a prepayment penalty under certain circumstances. The
balance outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $18 million and $6
million, respectively. Maturities under the Agreement are as follows: 1997 to
2000 - $3,888,000 annually; and 2001 - $2,479,000.
The Agreement contains certain covenants, including a requirement that
MK Gain maintain specified cash-flow-to-debt-service and debt-to-equity ratios.
Additionally, the return of $137 million of the initial equity investment to
the Company from MK Gain is restricted by a subordination agreement. If MK Gain
maintains specified operating and financial ratios, the subordination agreement
permits payments of interest and principal on the intercompany debt concurrently
with payments to Bancomer under the Agreement.
In connection with the Agreement, MK Gain entered into a trust
agreement Trust Agreement with a Mexican multiple banking institution
Trustee. The Trust Agreement provides that all monies received from the
Mexican National Railway contract are to be deposited into a trust. The Trustee
is required to maintain specified balances in a reserve fund established for
debt service. Once required debt service and other payments have been made, any
remaining amounts in excess of the reserve fund requirements are to be returned
to MK Gain. Amounts held in trust at the balance sheet date are classified as
restricted cash and have been included in other non-current assets in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1996 and 1995.
On December 16, 1996, MK Gain and Bancomer amended the Agreement. The
amendment is intended to provide MK Gain with greater financial flexibility by
way of, among other modifications, an increase in the maximum permitted monthly
disbursement from $11 million to $15 million, an increase in the maximum
amount of principal that MK Gain is permitted to have outstanding under this
facility from $235 million to $271 million, a change in the calculation of the
success fee payable to Bancomer from 556% of net after-tax cash flow without
limitation to a series of 11 fixed semi-annual payments of $75,000 each, and an
initial payment of $90,000 which was made in December 1996. The amendment did
not modify the interest rate or term of the facility.
35     On December 16, 1996, MK Gain entered into an additional credit
agreement with Bancomer which will provide up to $35 million in U.S. dollar
financing, non-recourse to MotivePower, to support MK Gain investments in
property, plant and equipment. At December 31, 1996 and 1995, a domestic
subsidiary of the Company had other outstanding debt obligations of $18 million
and $22 million,  respectively.  These obligations consist primarily of
Industrial Revenue Bonds IRB in the amount of $14 million in 1996 and $16
million in 1995, and bear interest at rates ranging from 45% to 10%. Maturities
under these obligations at December 31, 1996 were as follows: 1997 - $411,000;
1998 - $444,000; 1999 - $477,000; and 2000 - $471,000. Total maturities under
long-term obligations are as follows: 1997 - $11,626,000; 1998 - $4,332,000;
1999 - $4,365,000; 2000 - $4,359,000; 2001 - $2,479,000.
8.    Redeemable Preferred Stock
In September 1995, the Company deposited 10,000 shares of Class A
Preferred Stock into a joint settlement account in connection with the
settlement of certain class action suits. Effective as of May 15, 1996, the
Company exercised its right to replace the Class A Preferred Stock with $1
million in cash and issued 10,000 shares of Class B Preferred Stock to The
Fidelity & Casualty Company of New York in consideration of $1 million, which
was in turn paid to the plaintiffs to satisfy the Company obligations to
settle the class action suits, and all of the previously issued shares of Class
A Preferred Stock were simultaneously canceled. On December 6, 1996, the Company
exercised its option to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Class B
Preferred Stock at a price of $11 million including accrued dividends.
9.    Stock Option Plans
The Company has established two stock option plans which are described
below. The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related Interpretations in
accounting for its plans.
The compensation cost that has been charged against income was $775,000
and $63,000 for 1996 and 1995, respectively. Had compensation cost for the
Company plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for
awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS 123, the Company
net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma
amounts indicated below                            1996       1995
Net income loss       As reported.    $  11,509   $  40,414
Pro forma.    $  11,104   $  40,414
Earnings loss per share   As reported.    $    66  $   234
Pro forma.    $    63  $   234
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the
fair value of each option grant on the grant date using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model in 1996 and 1995, respectively; dividend yield of zero
percent for all years; expected volatility of 72% and 69%; risk free interest
rates of 65% and 60%; and expected lives of 10 years for all plans.
In the MotivePower  Industries,  Inc. Stock Incentive Plan the
Incentive Plan, a maximum of 25 million shares may be issued upon the
exercise of stock options granted or through limited stock appreciation rights.
Officers and other key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries are eligible
to receive awards. The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to
each award are determined by
36 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of the grant of
each award and may vary with each award granted. Awards, which are made at not
less than current market prices at date of grant, have been granted to
executives and directors under the Incentive Plan in the form of stock options.
Options granted generally vest either over a five-year period, 20% on each
anniversary date following the grant, or a four-year period 25% on each
anniversary date following the grant. All unexercised options expire 10 years
from the date of grant, subject to acceleration in certain cases.
Restricted stock awards for a total of 150,000 shares of the Company
Common Stock have been granted to certain key management employees. The weighted
average grant date fair value of restricted stock granted was $527 per share.
Sale restrictions on the restricted stock lapse between January 1, 1997 and June
30, 2001. The Company recorded an expense of $155,000 in 1996 related to the
restricted stock.
In the MotivePower Industries, Inc. Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee
Directors the Non-Employee Directors Plan, a maximum of 150,000 shares may
be granted. The price per share of the options shall be equal to 50% of the fair
market value of the stock on the grant date. All options granted shall vest over
a three-year period, one-third on each anniversary date. Unearned compensation,
representing the difference between the fair market value at the grant date and
the exercise price is charged to income over the vesting period.
A summary of the status of the Company two stock option plans as of
December 31, 1996 and 1995 and the changes during the years ending on those
dates is presented below                                   1996           1995

For the year ended December 31, 1996, income tax expense was $77
million, and the extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment produced an income
tax benefit of $687,000.
38     As discussed in Note 12, on September 10, 1996, the Company repurchased
for $346 million all of the debt plus accrued interest of the Company owed to
Morrison Knudsen, which totaled $566 million. This settlement decreased the net
deferred tax asset by $39 million. On June 15, 1995 the Company and Morrison
Knudsen entered into an agreement under which the Company net intercompany
account was reduced by $295 million. This settlement decreased the net deferred
tax asset by $109 million.
At December 31, 1996, MK Gain had a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $234 million expiring in various amounts during 2004-2005, and
the Company had a consolidated U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $48 million expiring in various amounts during 2009- 2010. Due to
an ownership change on September 11, 1996, the Company will be restricted as to
annual use of certain tax attributes.
For the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 foreign income
loss before income tax benefit was $46 million, $32 million and $123
million, respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1996 and 1995

some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company
has  established a valuation  allowance for certain net operating  loss

11.   Benefit Plans
Retirement: Beginning in May 1994, the Company established a defined
contribution, 401k savings plan to replace the former Morrison Knudsen plan.
In January 1996, the Company suspended Company contributions to the 401K
savings plan. On January 1, 1997 the Company partially reinstated those
contributions equal to 1% of an eligible employees gross salary in the form of
Company stock. The program may be fully reinstated 2% later in 1997 dependent
upon the achievement of certain performance goals. The Company costs of this
plan were $71,000, $752,000 and $446,000 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
In addition, Company salaried employees participated through April
1994 in a Morrison Knudsen Employee Stock Ownership Plan ESOP. Compensation
expense was $281,000 in 1994. The Company employees had the option of
transferring their contributions into the Company new 401k plan or leaving
their contributions in the Morrison Knudsen ESOP.                    40      One of the Company subsidiaries sponsored a non-contributory
defined benefit pension plan covering certain nonunion salaried employees of
that subsidiary. During 1994, the subsidiary curtailed its plan resulting in a
loss of $233,000. In 1996 the plan was settled which resulted in a gain of
$309,000. Pension cost included the following components                         Year ended December 31,

The discount rates used in determining the actuarial present value of
the accumulated benefit obligation were 75% and 85% for 1995 and 1994,
respectively. The expected long-term rate of return was 85% for 1995 and 1994.
The Company participates in multiemployer pension, and health and
welfare plans. The plans are defined contribution plans and provide benefits for
craft employees covered under collective  bargaining agreements at Boise
Locomotive and Motor Coils. Costs under the plan amounted to $21 million, $23
million and $38 million for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Company adopted two long-term incentive plans for selected
employees in 1994. The plans provide deferred compensation based upon total
shareholder return or return on total capital. No compensation expense was
recognized in connection with these plans in 1996, 1995 or 1994.                    41 Health Care: Certain health care benefits are provided for employees who
retired prior to July 1, 1993. Employees who have retired, or will retire,
thereafter must pay the full cost of postretirement health care benefits.
Retirees who retired before July 1, 1990 pay no contributions for coverage while
those who retired after July 1, 1990 and before July 1, 1993 make monthly
contributions equal to 1% of their final annual pay.
Net  post-retirement  health care cost  includes the following

Discount rate for interest cost          70%  85%  70      The annual rate increase in the per capita cost of health care
benefits is assumed to be 9% in 1996, decreasing to 8% in 1999 and then grading
down 5% per year to 45% in 2006 and thereafter, over the projected payout
period of the benefits. A 1% increase in the health care cost trend rate would
increase accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1996
by $133,347 and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components for
the year then ended by $13,052.                    42 12.    Related Party Transactions
As of December 31, 1995, the Company note payable to Morrison
Knudsen was $521 million. This note related to various items, including
advances made to the Company by Morrison Knudsen net of repayments made by the
Company to Morrison Knudsen.
On June 15, 1995, in order to settle their good faith dispute
regarding the intercompany account and the various transactions related thereto,
the Company and Morrison Knudsen entered into an agreement under which the
Company net intercompany account was reduced by $295 million from $817
million as of May 31, 1995 to $522 million.
The $522 million original balance of the net intercompany account
was evidenced by an unsecured promissory note, due May 31, 2000, bearing
interest at the prime rate. On September 10, 1996, the Company repurchased for
$346 million all of the debt of the Company owed to Morrison Knudsen. The
amount of the debt outstanding as of the date of repurchase, including accrued
interest, was $566 million. The effect of this transaction was an increase to
additional paid-in capital of $149 million, a decrease in the Deferred Tax
Asset of $39 million and a reduction in amounts due to Morrison Knudsen of
$566 million.
The Company leases certain facilities from certain directors and
former directors and officers of the Company. Lease payments, including
utilities, to these individuals totaled $11 million, $986,000 and $900,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The Company incurred $19 million and $36 million of legal fees and
expenses from a firm in which a former officer of the Company is a shareholder,
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
13.    Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has commitments and performance guarantees arising from
locomotive remanufacturing contracts and maintenance agreements, and warranties
from the sale of new locomotives, remanufactured locomotives and locomotive
components.
Environmental: The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign
environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling
and disposal of hazardous or toxic  substances  and petroleum  products
collectively referred to as waste. Examples of regulated activities are the
disposal of lubricating oil, the discharge of water used to clean parts and to
cool machines, the maintenance of underground storage tanks and the release of
particulate emissions produced by Company operations. For some activities the
Company must obtain permits.
Violation of environmental laws or regulations could subject the
Company and its  management to civil and criminal  penalties and other
liabilities. In addition, third parties may make claims for personal injuries
and property damage associated with releases of waste. A current or prior owner
or operator of property may be required to investigate and clean up waste
releases and may be liable to governmental entities or some other third party
for their  investigation  and remediation  costs in connection with the
contamination. The Company arranges for the disposal or treatment of waste at
disposal or treatment facilities owned by third parties. The Company could be
liable for the costs of removing or remediating a release of waste at such
facilities.
Because it owns and operates property,  the Company may have
responsibility and liability even if it does not know of or cause the presence
of contaminants. Liability is often joint and several and is generally not
limited. The cost to investigate, remediate and remove waste may be substantial
43 and may even exceed the value of the property or the aggregate assets of the
owner or operator.  The Company may have difficulty selling or renting
contaminated property or borrowing against such property. The government
sometimes creates liens against property for damages and costs it incurs in
connection with contamination. The Company has potential liabilities associated
with its and its predecessor past waste disposal activities, including
disposal activities at plants currently being operated by the Company.
Boise, Idaho
Heavy equipment repair and locomotive remanufacturing commenced at Boise
Locomotive in 1972. At the time, solvents were used in the process of cleaning
parts and equipment as part of the repair/remanufacturing process at the
facility. Wastewater generated from the equipment cleaning process containing
solvents was discharged during the process to in-ground wastewater separation
basins that were connected to buried drain fields. This wastewater treatment
system was in place until 1984. In 1985, the Company predecessor received
notices from the Idaho  Department of Health and Welfare,  Division of
Environmental Quality and the United States Environmental Protection Agency,
indicating that it was in violation of state and federal environmental laws with
respect to this treatment system at Boise Locomotive. Related regulatory
requirements led to the closure of the buried drain fields and a buried trench
that was used for disposal of waste material. Further requirements led to the
issuance in 1991 of a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Part B Post Closure
Permit the Permit, which is the formal permit pursuant to which a detailed
corrective action plan is specified for groundwater cleanup and for protection
of the public and environment following the closure or termination of the
releases which created the problem. In compliance with the Permit, about 57
wells have been drilled on the Boise Locomotive property and on adjacent
property to monitor, collect, and treat contaminated shallow groundwater, to
monitor any movement of the contaminated plume, and to monitor the deeper
groundwater systems at the facility. The Company has estimated the expected
aggregate undiscounted costs to be incurred over the next 24 years, adjusted for
inflation at 3% per annum, to be $48 million, based on the Permit corrective
action plan, and $44 million for contingent additional Permit compliance
requirements related to off-site groundwater contamination. The discounted
liability at December 31, 1996, using a discount rate of 65%, was $21 million
based on the Permit corrective action plan, and $2 million for contingent
additional Permit compliance requirements related to off-site groundwater
contamination. The estimated outlays for each of the five succeeding years from
1997 to 2001 are: $253,000, $260,000, $268,000, $317,000 and $284,000. The
Company was in compliance with the Permit at December 31, 1996. In addition,
Boise Locomotive would be liable for any damages resulting from hazardous
substances migrating from the facility to deeper groundwater systems, including
the regional aquifer system which serves most of the domestic and industrial
users of groundwater in the area which includes and extends beyond Boise.
Three private off-site wells are known to have been impacted by shallow
groundwater contamination. Two of these wells are used for residential domestic
purposes, and the third well is used for supply to a pond and landscape watering
for a residential subdivision. Boise Locomotive has entered into agreements
whereby the residential domestic use of the wells will be abandoned and domestic
water will be provided via a public water supply hook-up. In the event of
contamination of the regional aquifer, Boise Locomotive would be required, among
other things, to provide potable water to affected users and to install a
treatment system to clean up the polluted water, and could incur other
liabilities, the combined cost of which cannot be estimated, but would be
expected to be material in amount. The regional aquifer system, however, occurs
at a depth which is approximately 200 feet below the shallow
44 contaminated groundwater that is currently being remediated. While management
believes there is no evidence that the regional aquifer system is currently
threatened by releases of contaminants from Boise Locomotive, no assurance can
be given in this regard.
Mexico
Through its MK Gain, S.A. de C.V. MK Gain subsidiary, the Company
has operational responsibility for facilities in Acambaro and San Luis Potosi in
Mexico, pursuant to a contract with the Mexican National Railway. Under the
contract, MK Gain is responsible for performing certain work related to
environmental protection at the facilities, such as waste water treatment, storm
water control, tank repair, and spill prevention and control. The costs of this
work are either to be directly reimbursed to MK Gain by the Mexican National
Railway or recoverable through fees payable under the contract, which has been
structured to account for such cost. No assurance can be given, however, that
the Mexican National Railway will not dispute any submissions for reimbursement
or that the fee structure under the contract will, in fact, cover costs. MK
Gain operations are subject to Mexican environmental laws and regulations. It
has obtained, or is in the process of obtaining, environmental permits, licenses
and approvals required for its operations.
Mountaintop, Pennsylvania
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act also known as CERCLA or Superfund is a federal law regarding abandoned
hazardous waste sites which imposes joint and several liability, without regard
to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons,
including those who contribute to the release of a hazardous substance into
the environment. Foster Wheeler Energy Corporation FWEC is named as a
potentially responsible party with respect to the Company Mountaintop,
Pennsylvania plant, which has been listed by the EPA in its data base of
potential hazardous waste sites, the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Information System CERCLIS. FWEC, the seller of
the Mountaintop property to the Company predecessor in 1989, agreed to
indemnify the Company predecessor against any liabilities associated with this
Superfund site. Management believes that this indemnification arrangement is
enforceable for the benefit of the Company and, although such obligation is
unsecured and therefore structurally subordinate to secured indebtedness of
FWEC, that FWEC has the financial resources to honor its obligations under this
indemnification arrangement. This indemnification does not alter the Company
potential liability to third parties other than FWEC or governmental agencies
under CERCLA but creates contractual obligations on the part of FWEC for such
liabilities.
Richland Township, Pennsylvania
Motor Coils owns a vacant lot in Richland Township, Pennsylvania which
has been subject to unauthorized dumping by unknown parties. The Company has not
yet tested the soil at the site or materials disposed there. Based on a visual
inspection, Motor Coils cannot yet estimate the cost to remove and properly
dispose of the material, and does not believe that the removal will have a
material adverse impact on the Company financial position or results of
operations.
St. Louis, Missouri Motor Coils completed voluntary remediation of
surficial contamination resulting from a release of xylene in connection with a
storage tank leak at its St. Louis, Missouri facility. Motor Coils
45 notified the relevant state regulatory agency of its remediation plan and, with
the concurrence of the state agency, initiated site remediation in 1994. Based
on monitoring results, the Company discontinued site remediation in 1996.
The Company believes that its planned expenditures are adequate to meet
its known environmental obligations and liabilities, including those under the
Permit, and under CERCLA and similar legislation. The Company knowledge of its
environmental  obligations  and liabilities is, for the majority of its
facilities,  based on  assessments  and due diligence  conducted by its
predecessor personnel and Phase I and/or Phase II environmental assessments
conducted by third-party consultants. No assurance can be given, however, that
stricter interpretation and enforcement of existing environmental laws or
regulations, the adoption of new laws or regulations, the discovery of currently
unknown waste or contamination for which the Company may be liable, the
inability of the Company to enforce the indemnification with respect to the
Mountaintop plant or the continued spread of the hazardous waste plume through
off-site groundwater near Boise Locomotive will not result in significantly
higher environmental costs to the Company.
Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change at any time.
Compliance with current or future laws and regulations could potentially
necessitate significant capital outlays by the Company, affect the economics of
a given project or cause material changes or delays in intended activities.
Leases: The Company leases office and manufacturing facilities under operating
leases with terms ranging from one to 12 years, excluding renewal options.
The Company has also financed its locomotive lease fleet with operating
leases arising from sale and leaseback transactions. The Company has sold
remanufactured locomotives to various financial institutions and leased them
back under operating leases with terms from five to 20 years.
Total net rental expense income charged or credited to operations
in 1996, 1995 and 1994 was $799,000, $504,000, and $3 million, respectively.
Certain of the Company equipment rental obligations under operating leases
pertain to locomotives which are subleased to customers under both short-term
and long-term agreements. The above amounts are shown net of sublease rentals of
$87 million, $78 million, and $57 million for the years 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. Future minimum rental payments under operating leases with
remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year are as follows in

2002 and after   4,188    33,039    12,805    24,422 Legal Proceedings: In December 1995, Morrison Knudsen, the Company and certain
of Morrison Knudsen directors and officers were named as defendants in a
complaint the Pilarczyk Lawsuit filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of New York by plaintiffs who were
46 principals in and/or held substantial stock in TMS, Inc. TMS, a New York
corporation acquired by Morrison Knudsen on December 30, 1992. The complaint
alleges, among other things, violations of Section 10b, Rule 10b-5 and Section
20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of contract, unjust
enrichment, negligent misrepresentation and common law fraud during Morrison
Knudsen acquisition of TMS in 1992. Plaintiffs assert that the Company, which
was not formed by Morrison Knudsen until 1993, is fully responsible for the acts
of Morrison Knudsen. However, the actions complained of occurred before the
Company was formed and the Company did not assume such liabilities of Morrison
Knudsen. A motion to dismiss, filed in April 1996 on behalf of all defendants to
the Pilarczyk Lawsuit, is still pending. Counsel to the Company believes the
causes of action in the Pilarczyk Lawsuit relating to the Company are without
merit and the Company expects that it will be successful on this motion, even if
the suit is not dismissed as to all defendants. If the Company is successful,
the Company intends to make appropriate requests to the court to seek to require
the plaintiff to pay the Company legal fees and costs.
In June 1995, the Company was named as defendant in a complaint filed
with the Idaho Human Rights Commission the Idaho Commission and the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission by a female employee on behalf of herself and
other women employed by the Company alleging discrimination based on sex, which
complaint was amended in December 1995 to include allegations of retaliatory
discharge. In 1996, the idaho Commission announced that it found no probable
cause to believe either discrimination or retaliatory discharge had occurred as
alleged in the complaint and, accordingly, the proceeding was dismissed.
The Company is engaged in a commercial dispute with a former supplier,
Samyoung Machinery Industrial Co. and Samyoung America, Inc. collectively,
Samyoung. The Company filed suit on April 16, 1996 alleging delivery of
defective product and seeking damages in excess of $1 million. Samyoung denies
that the product was defective and countersued to recover $300,000 under the
contract, and $10 million for trade libel and interference with prospective
economic relationships as a result of the Company allegedly making false
disparaging  statements  concerning the diesel engine assembly liners to
customers. The Company believes that Samyoung claims are without merit, and,
to date, no evidence supporting Samyoung counterclaims has come to light
through the discovery being conducted by the parties. The Company intends to
vigorously prosecute its own claims and defend against Samyoung counterclaims.
In the ordinary course of its business, the Company is involved in
legal proceedings incident to the normal conduct of its business, including
contract claims and employee matters. Although the outcome of any pending legal
proceeding cannot be predicted with certainty, at December 31, 1996, the Company
had accrued approximately $405,000 for these matters. In part because of this
accrual, and based upon the information obtained to date, management believes
that such legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated operations or financial condition of
the Company.                    47 14.   Geographic Information and Major Customers

by the Company and the reduction of interest expense resulting from the assumed

16.   Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined
by the Company, using available market information and appropriate valuation
methodologies.  Although considerable judgment is necessarily required in
interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value, due to the small
notional amount of outstanding letters of credit, in the estimation of the
Company management, the fair values of the Company financial instruments are
not materially different from their carrying values on the Company financial
statements. In management estimation, based on the variable interest rates
applicable to outstanding long-term debt, the fair value of the long-term debt
is not materially different from its carrying value.                    49 17.   Quarterly Financial Information unaudited
