CORPORATION
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Description of Business Datalink
Corporation the Company is an independent architect of enterprise-class
information storage infrastructures. The Company derives its revenues
principally from designing, installing and supporting data storage systems. The
Companys solutions can include hardware products, such as disk arrays, tape
systems and interconnection components, and storage management software
products. The Company is frequently engaged to provide assistance in the
installation of solutions and to provide support services subsequent to the
installation. Occasionally, the Company is engaged for consulting services.
2. Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist principally of money market
funds with original maturities of three months or less, are readily convertible
to cash and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Company
maintains its cash in bank deposit and money market accounts which, at times,
may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses
in such accounts.
Accounts Receivable, net Trade receivables are carried at original invoice
amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all
outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for
doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and
considering a customers financial condition and credit history and current economic
conditions. Trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries
of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received.
Accounts receivable are recorded net of the reserve
for doubtful accounts of $72,000 and $70,000 at December31, 2005 and
2004, respectively.
Concentration of Credit Risk During 2003, net sales from our customer, Gateway,Inc.,
10% of total net sales. The Company had no other customers that comprised more
than 10% of its sales in 2003, 2004 or 2005. The balance of accounts receivable
for this customer as a percentage of total accounts receivable as of December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively is 0% and 0%.
Software Development Costs In compliance with the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for
Computer Software Developed for or Obtained for Internal Use, the Company
capitalized certain costs associated with software developed or obtained for
internal use.
During 2000, the Company began the implementation of a
new customer relationship management CRM application suite which was
completed in 2003. The Company capitalized costs of the implementation of
$234,000 in 2003. The system is complete and no further costs are expected. Amounts
are being amortized over a period of 3 years from the date they are available
for use. The Company has also capitalized other software develop costs for
enhancements to our business reporting software tool. Amortization of software
costs were $543,000 in 2005, $729,000 in 2004, and $815,000 in 2003. 34 Inventories Inventories, including inventories shipped but not
installed, principally consist of data storage products and components, that
are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in,
first-out FIFO method. Inventories have been reduced by obsolete and slow
moving reserves of $100,000 and $71,000 at December31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
Property and Equipment Property
and equipment, including purchased software, are stated at cost. Depreciation
and amortization are provided by charges to operations using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 2 to 10
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the underlying lease term. The costs
and related accumulated depreciation and amortization on asset disposals are
removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations. Major
renewals and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are
charged to current operations when incurred.

Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statement No142, goodwill is tested for impairment
annually, and additionally if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill
is done at a reporting-unit level. An impairment loss would generally be
recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The Company completed its
impairment assessments for December31, 2005 and 2004, and determined that
no impairment existed.
Intangibles, net Identifiable intangible assets were amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 7 years. In
October2003, the Company announced several cost reduction actions. These
actions included the closing an office and terminating personnel acquired by
the Company from OpenSystems.com in November2000, resulting in an
impairment of the Companys customer base intangible asset. The Company estimated
the impact that closure of this office and termination of its personnel would
have on the OpenSystems.com customer accounts and the related expected cash
flows, considering the likelihood of retaining the customers without an office
presence. The Company then compared the undiscounted cash flows with the net
book value of the intangible asset which indicated the asset was impaired. To
determine the impairment charge of $926,000, the Company calculated the
discounted cash flows and compared them to the net book value of the intangible
and determined the resulting impairment charge of the asset. The remaining
balance of the intangible was fully amortized in 2005. 35 Valuation of Long-Lived Assets The Company periodically at least annually analyzes
its long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets with discrete
lives, for potential impairment, assessing the appropriateness of lives and
recoverability of unamortized balances through measurement of undiscounted
operating cash flows on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Stock Options As permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123, the Company has elected to continue following
the guidance of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25 for
measurement and recognition of stock-based transactions with employees. No
compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted to employees
under the plans where the exercise price of the options granted was equal to
the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant.
Pro
forma net loss and loss per share have been determined as if the Company had
used the fair value method of accounting for its stock option grants and
employee stock purchase plan share elections consistent with the method of SFAS
No123. Under this method, compensation expense is recognized over the
applicable vesting periods and is based on the shares under option and their
related fair values on the grant date.

purchase 49,032 shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP. Using the
Black-Scholes pricing model, the weighted average fair value was $108 per
share for each election. During the 2004 and 2003 ESPP offering, employees
elected to purchase 35,246 and 23,883 shares respectively. Using the
Black-Scholes pricing model, the weighted average fair value was $042 per share
for each election in 2004 and $040 per share for each election in 2003.
In December2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board published FASB Statement No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment FAS 123R. In March2005, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No107 relating to
the adoption of SFAS 123R. SFAS123R, which will begin to apply in the
Companys first quarter of 2006, requires the Company to recognize the
compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions, including
grants of employee stock options, in its financial statements. The Company will
measure this cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability
instruments issued. The statement covers a wide range of share-based
compensation arrangements, including stock options, restricted share plans,
performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase
plans. The statement will require the Company to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. The Company then will recognize the cost over the period it
requires the employee to provide services for the award. SFAS 123Ris
effective for the Company as of January1, 2006. The Company is evaluating
the adoption criteria outlined in SFAS 123R. However, the pro forma effect on
net income using the fair value method for the past three years is presented in
the table above. The pro forma information may not be indicative of the actual
effect on net income when SFAS 123Ris adopted as such effect is
dependent upon many factors, including the number of stock options granted in
the future as well as their related terms.
On December19, 2005, the Companys Board of
Directors took action to accelerate vesting of all outstanding employee stock
options. As of that date, the Company had a total of 1,768,037 employee options
outstanding, of which 1,442,912 were vested and 325,125 were unvested. The
Board accelerated the vesting schedule of the 325,125 unvested employee
options, of which 197,125 the underwater options had exercise prices in
excess of $340 per share and 128,000 the in the money options had exercise
prices less than the current market price on the accelerated vesting date. The
Company did not accelerate the vesting of options granted to Board members.

The Board took the action to accelerate the vesting of
the options in order to eliminate approximately $244,000 in compensation expense
that the Company would otherwise have incurred over two years beginning in
2006, upon the adoption of FAS 123R. Under FAS 123R, the Company would have
recognized the expense associated with these options grants as the options
vested. The Company also recorded compensation expense of $2,300 during 2005,
related to the 128,000 unvested in the money options, because of the likelihood
that certain employees may terminate employment with the Company prior to when
the options would have vested under the original vesting schedule.
Income Taxes The Company calculates income taxes in accordance with
the provisions of SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the liability method, deferred income taxes are recorded to
reflect the tax  37 consequences in future
years of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts using enacted tax rates for the years in
which these items are expected to affect taxable income. The Company
establishes valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount the Company expects are more likely than not to realize. Income
tax benefit expense is the tax payable receivable for the period and the
change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. Significant items subject to
estimates and assumptions include the valuation for deferred tax assets,
reserve for doubtful accounts, reserve for obsolete and slow moving excess
inventory and valuation of long-lived assets. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Revenue Recognition Revenue
Recognition. The
Company realizes revenue from the design, installation and support of data
storage solutions, which may include hardware, software and services. The
Company recognizes revenue when it has met its obligations for installation or
other services and collectability is reasonably assured.
Product
Sales. The
Company sells software and hardware products on both a free-standing basis
without any services and as data storage solutions bundled with its
installation and configuration services bundled arrangements.
Product
Sales Without Service. If
the Company sells a software or hardware product and does not provide any
installation or configuration services with it, the Company recognizes the
product revenues upon shipment.
Product
Sales With Service. If the
Company sells a bundled arrangement, then the Company defers recognizing any
revenues on it until the Company finishes its installation and/or configuration
work. The Company accounts for the hardware, software and service elements of
its bundled arrangements by applying the provisions of Statement of Position
SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP 98-4
and SOP 98-9.
Pursuant to the provisions of SOP 97-2, the
Company applies contract accounting to its bundled arrangements. In accordance
with SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and
Certain Production Type Contracts, the Company applies the completed contract
method. Factors the Company has considered in applying the completed contract
method accounting include ithe relatively short duration of its
contracts, iithe difficulty of estimating its revenues on a
percentage-of-completion method and iiiits use of acceptance provisions
on larger bundled arrangements.
Service
Sales. In
addition to installation and configuration services that are part of the
Companys bundled arrangements described above, the Companys service sales
include customer support contracts and consulting services. On the Companys
balance sheet, deferred revenue relates to service sales for which the Companys
customer has paid the Company or has been invoiced but for which the Company
has not yet performed the applicable services.
Customer
Support Contracts. The
Company sells service contracts to most of its customers. These contracts are
support service agreements. The Company has an internal support desk that
provides integrated customer support services, including configuration and
usage assistance, technical advice and prompt incident detection and resolution.
The Companys technical staff first assists a customer in  38 identifying the source of
system problems and in determining whether there is defective hardware or
software. If the Companys customer requires on-site maintenance or repair
services, the Company arranges for a service call pursuant to underlying
third-party support service agreements the Company has with its hardware and
software vendors.
When the Company sells a service contract as part of a
bundled arrangement, it uses vendor specific objective evidence to allocate
revenue to the service contract element. In all cases, the Company defers
revenues and direct costs resulting from its service contracts and amortizes
them into operations over the term of the contracts, which are generally twelve
months. The Company is contractually obligated to provide or arrange to provide
these underlying support services to its customers in the unlikely event that
the hardware or software vendor, or its designee, fails to perform according to
the terms of its contact.
Consulting
Services. Some of
the Companys customers engage the Company to analyze their existing storage
architectures and offer its recommendations. Other customers engage the Company
to assist them on-site with extended data storage projects, to support their
data storage environments and to help with long-term data storage design
challenges. For these types of consulting services that do not include the sale
of hardware or software products, the Company recognizes revenues as it
performs these services.
Net Income Loss Per Share Basic net income loss per share is computed using
the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income per share
includes the effect of common stock equivalents, if any, for each period. The
number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock
options were exercised and that the proceeds from such exercise were used to
acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting
period. Due to the net loss in 2005, 2004 and 2003, potential common shares of
172,028, 80,756 and 105,931, respectively, would have been anti-dilutive to
losses and as a result were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per
share.
Comprehensive Income Loss The Companys comprehensive income loss is equal to
its net loss for all periods presented.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments At December31,
2005 and 2004, the carrying values of current financial instruments such as
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current
assets, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities, approximated their
market values, based on the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Companys bank revolving credit facility expired on June30, 2004. The
Company has elected not to pursue a new facility at this time. With the Companys
current cash position, it believes it has the liquidity to meet its operating
needs for the foreseeable future. The Company has no outstanding debt, and if
the need should arise to borrow funds, the Company believes that it could
obtain a secured facility.
5. Income Taxes The benefit from income taxes in 2003 consisted primarily
of current federal income taxes.

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 was $48 million, $47 million and $28 million,
respectively. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was an increase of $149,000, $19
million and $12 million, respectively.
In assessing the recoverability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income during the periods in which  40 those temporary
differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, carry back potential and projected future taxable
income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In the future
when management believes it can reasonably estimate future operating results
and those estimated results reflect taxable income, the amount of deferred tax
assets considered realizable would be adjusted by a reduction in the valuation
allowance.
At December31,
2005, the Company had federal net operating loss carry forwards of
approximately $65 million and state net operating loss carry forwards of
approximately $130 million, which are available to offset future federal and
state taxable income. If not used, these net operating loss carry forwards will
expire between 2013 and 2024. Federal net operating losses expire as follows

In December2004, the Company agreed to sublease
approximately 55,000 of the 104,000 square feet it then occupied as its
corporate headquarters in Chanhassen, Minnesota. The initial sublease term is
co-terminal with the original lease and is 85 months starting in April2005
and ending in April2012. The sublessee pays the Company rent ranging from
approximately $55,000 per month at the beginning of the term to approximately
$60,000 per month by the end of the term. The rent includes the costs of common
area management, common systems repairs, real estate taxes and standard
utilities. The Company also negotiated with its landlord to sell the 25 acre
lot adjoining the Companys facility for $200,000 which the Company had
originally acquired in 2001 for $384,000. In January2005, the Company
discontinued use of the sublease area and the Company incurred a one-time,

asset. The resulting impairment charge of the asset was $926,000. The Company
had $202,000 of remaining accruals as of December31, 2003, primarily for
a severance agreement to a former officer, to be paid in 2004. In

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to
employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employee,
and related interpretations. Accordingly, compensation cost for stock options
granted to employees is measured as the excess, if any, of the fair value of
the Companys common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee
must pay to acquire the stock.
During 2000 and 1999, the
Company issued 135,850 options with an exercise price below the fair market
value of common stock at the date of grant. The intrinsic value of those
options is being recorded to compensation expense over the vesting period,
generally four years. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, $0, $17,000 and $111,000,
respectively, of compensation expense was recorded related to these options. As
of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, there was $0, $0 and $17,000,
respectively, of compensation expense related to these options to be recognized
in future periods. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company issued 0, 0 and
46,750 options, respectively, to directors below the fair market value of
common stock at the date of grant. The compensation expense on such options
recorded was $0, $0 and $83,000 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Because
the options vest immediately, all compensation expense was recorded in the
period of the grant. 44 10.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In November2004, the FASB issued SFAS No151,
Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No43, Chapter 4. The amendments
made by the SFAS No151 require that abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recognized
as current-period charges. This Statement requires that allocation of fixed
production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of production
facilities. SFAS No151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company does not believe
the adoption of SFAS No151 will have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
In March2005, the
FASB issued Interpretation No47, or FIN 47, which clarifies terminology in
FASB Statement No143, Accounting for
Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 clarifies when an entity has
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset
retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective for the Company in fiscal 2006. We
do not believe the adoption of FIN 47 will have a material impact on our
financial statements.
