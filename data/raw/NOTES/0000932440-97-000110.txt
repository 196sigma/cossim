Viatel, Inc We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Viatel, Inc. and
subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection with our audits
of the consolidated financial statements, we also audited the financial
statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Viatel,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.                       KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Viatel, Inc. the Company provides value-added  telecommunications
services primarily to businesses operating internationally.  In order to
effectuate a reincorporation in the State of Delaware, VIA USA, Ltd. a
predecessor Colorado corporation merged with and into its wholly owned
subsidiary, Viatel, Inc., on October 11, 1994. The surviving entity, Viatel,
Inc., has reflected all assets and liabilities at historical cost.
B PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates in
which the Company has significant influence but does not exercise control are
accounted for under the equity method.
C CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company policy is to maintain its uninvested cash at minimum levels.
Cash equivalents, which include highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less, were $71,765,458 and $3,116,218 at December
31, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
D REVENUE
The Company records telecommunications revenue as earned, at the time
services are provided.
E PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment consist principally of telecommunications related
equipment such as switches, fiber optic cable systems, remote nodes and related
computer software and is stated at cost. Equipment acquired under capital leases
is stated at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Maintenance
and repairs are expensed as incurred.
Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the life of the lease or useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.
The estimated useful lives are as follows   Communications  5 to 7 years
Fiber optic cable  15 years
Leasehold  2 to 5 years
Furniture, equipment and other. 5 years                    36              VIATEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
F INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of
net assets acquired, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
periods to be benefited, seven years.
Acquired employee base and sales force in place represents the intangible
assets associated with the acquisition of independent sales organizations and is
being amortized over three years.
Deferred financing and registration fees represent debt financing costs
incurred to issue and register debt and which are being amortized over the term
of the related debt.
The costs of all other intangible assets are being amortized over their
useful lives, ranging from one to five years.
The Company intangible assets are assessed for recoverability at least
quarterly. The Company assesses the recoverability of its intangible assets by
determining whether the amortization of the related intangible asset balance
over its remaining life can be recovered through projections of undiscounted
future operating cash flows of the related intangible assets. The amount of
intangible asset impairment, if any, is measured based on projected discounted
future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the Company
average cost of funds. The assessment of the recoverability of intangible assets
will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved.
G INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences  attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income or expense in the period it occurs.
H FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated
using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the year. The effects of
exchange rate  fluctuations on translating  foreign  currency assets and
liabilities into U.S. dollars are accumulated as part of the foreign currency
translation adjustment in stockholders' equity. Gains and losses from foreign
currency transactions are included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the period in which they occur. For the years ending December 31,
1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company experienced $10,637 in foreign exchange
transaction losses and $107,846 and $15,234 in foreign exchange transaction
gains, respectively.
I NET LOSS PER SHARE
Net loss per common and common equivalent share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Per share
amounts have been retroactively restated to give effect to a reverse stock split
at a ratio of 3-to-2. See Note 7.                    37              VIATEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED J CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist primarily of temporary cash investments and trade
receivables. The Company restricts investment of temporary cash investments to
financial institutions with high credit standing.  Credit risk on trade
receivables is minimized as a result of the large and diverse nature of the
Company worldwide customer base.
K RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial
statements to conform to the current year presentation.
L USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
M ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Additional accounting policies are incorporated into the notes herein.
N STOCK OPTION PLAN
Prior to January 1, 1996, the Company accounted for its stock option plan
in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
As such, compensation expense was recorded on the date of grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. On
January 1, 1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, which permits entities to recognize as expense over the vesting
period the fair value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant.
Alternatively, SFAS No. 123 also allows entities to continue to apply the
provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and provide pro forma net income and pro forma
earnings per share disclosures for employee stock option grants made in 1995 and
future years as if the fair-value-based method, as defined in SFAS No. 123, had
been applied. The Company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB
Opinion No. 25 and provide the pro forma disclosure required by SFAS No. 123.
See Note 10.
O IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of on
January 1, 1996. SFAS 121 requires that long-lived  assets and certain
identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell. Adoption of SFAS 121 did not have a material impact on the Company
financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994 2 ACQUISITIONS
During December 1994, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
stock of two of its independent sales organizations. These acquisitions have
been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the
aggregate purchase price of $1,171,320 has been allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values as of the
acquisition date. Additionally, the results of operations of these organizations
are included in the consolidated statements of operations from dates of
acquisition. Included among the assets acquired are intangible assets which
principally related to the acquired employee base and sales force in place which
will be amortized over three years, which corresponds to the estimated remaining
service lives of the employee base and sales force. The allocation of the
aggregate purchase price is summarized as follows  Current   $ 161,486
Current    232,865
Property and    102,922
Intangible and other assets acquired..  1,139,777
Total purchase price..  $1,171,320
Due to the nature of the organizations acquired, pro forma revenue would
equal reported revenue and the pro forma net loss would be $194,007 higher than
the reported net loss for the year ended December 31, 1994.
3 INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in
debt securities at the time of purchase and classifies them as held to maturity
or available for sale. The Company does not invest in securities for the purpose
of trading and as such does not classify any securities as trading. These
investments are diversified among high credit quality securities in accordance
with the Company investment policy. Debt securities that the Company has both
the intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. Debt
securities for which the Company does not have the intent or ability to hold to
maturity are classified as available for sale. Securities available for sale are
carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax,
reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity.
The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held to maturity are
adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity
over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization and interest are
included in interest income. There were no securities classified as held to
maturity as of December 31, 1996.                    39              VIATEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

A SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES
On December 21, 1994, the Company issued $120,700,000, representing the
aggregate principal amount, of 15% senior unsecured discount notes due January
15, 2005 for approximately $58,000,000. The notes will fully accrete on a
semiannual compounding basis to face value on January 15, 2000 with semiannual
interest payments commencing July 15, 2000 until maturity.
The notes are redeemable at the Company option, in whole or in part, at
any time on or after January 15, 2000 until maturity at redemption prices that
range from 110% to 100% of the notes' face value plus accrued interest. In
addition, at any time prior to January 15, 1998, the Company may redeem up to
$42,245,000 of the face value of the notes with the proceeds of one or more
public equity offerings at 115% of the then accreted value of the notes, plus
accrued interest, if any, to the redemption date. Upon a change of control, the
Company is required to make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price
equal to 101% of their accreted value, plus accrued interest, if any. The notes
contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the
Company and certain of its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, make pre-payments
of certain indebtedness and pay dividends.
On December 31, 1996, the Company estimated the fair value of these notes
to be $77,800,000 which approximates its accreted value. The estimate is based
on quoted market prices for the notes.
B NOTE PAYABLE -- MCI
On January 28, 1994, the Company converted $2,666,755 of its outstanding
balance to MCI Telecommunications Corporation as of December 31, 1993 to a 7%
note secured by the Company accounts receivable. At December 31, 1994 966,755 was outstanding under this note and was included in notes payable,
current. At December 31, 1995, the note was no longer outstanding.
7 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
On April 5, 1994, the Company issued 2,140,538 shares of its Common Stock
for $8,000,000 and warrants to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. As of
December 31, 1995, the warrants have expired and are no longer exercisable.
Additionally, certain rights of the Company to repurchase a portion of the
shares have expired. Certain of such shares are subject to certain registration
rights in the event of public offerings by the Company.                    41              VIATEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

shares of non-voting, $01 par value, Class A Common Stock the Class A Common
Stock. On December 21, 1994, 2,904,846 shares of Class A Common Stock were
issued for net proceeds of $16,016,221.
On October 23, 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering
IPO of its common stock, $01 par value per share the Common Stock,
through which it sold 8,667,000 shares of Common Stock at $12 a share and raised
approximately $104 million of gross proceeds $945 million of net proceeds.
In connection with the IPO, all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock
were converted into shares of Common Stock at a ratio of one-to-one and all then
outstanding shares of Common Stock were then subject to a reverse stock split at
a ratio of 3-to-2. In addition, the Company stockholders approved an amendment
to the Company Certificate of Incorporation which i authorized the Board of
Directors to issue up to 1 million shares of Preferred Stock, $01 par value per
share, of which no shares were issued and outstanding at December 31, 1996, in
one or more series and to fix the powers, voting rights, designations and
preferences of each series and ii eliminated the Class A Common Stock.
All earnings per share and share data presented herein have been restated
retroactively to reflect the conversion of the Class A Common Stock into Common
Stock and the reverse stock split of all then outstanding shares of Common
Stock.
8 INCOME TAXES
The statutory Federal tax rates for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995
and 1994 were 35%. The effective tax rates were zero for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 due to the Company incurring net operating
losses for which no tax benefit was recorded.
For Federal income tax purposes, the Company has unused net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $64,783,000 expiring in 2007 through 2011. The
availability of the net operating loss carryforwards to offset income in future
years is restricted as a result of the Company issuance of its Common Stock
and as a result of future sales of Company stock and other events.
The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to significant
portions of the deferred tax assets are as follows                               DECEMBER 31,

whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income,
and tax planning in making these assessments. During 1996 and 1995, the
valuation allowance increased by $13,610,000 and $9,703,000, respectively.

10 STOCK OPTION PLAN
During 1993, the Board of Directors approved the 1993 Flexible Stock
Incentive Plan the Stock Incentive Plan under which non-qualified stock
options NQSOs to acquire shares of Common Stock may be granted to employees,
directors and consultants of the Company and incentive stock options ISOs
to acquire shares of Common Stock may be granted to employees, including
non-employee directors. The Stock Incentive Plan also provides for the grant of
stock appreciation rights SARs and shares of restricted stock to the
Company employees, directors and consultants.
The Stock Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of up to a maximum of
1,833,333 shares of Common Stock and is currently  administered by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Under the Stock Incentive
Plan, the option price of any ISO may not be less than the fair market value of
a share of Common Stock on the date on which the option is granted. The option
price of an NQSO may be less than the fair market value on the date the NQSO is
granted if the Board of Directors so determines. An ISO may not be granted to a
ten percent stockholder as such term is defined in Section 422A of the
Internal Revenue Code unless the exercise price is at least 110% of the fair
market value of the Common Stock and the term of the option may not exceed five
years from the date of grant. Common Stock subject to a restricted stock
purchase or bonus agreement is transferable only as provided in such agreement.
The maximum term of each stock option granted to persons other than ten percent
stockholders is ten years from the date of grant.
The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted during
1996 and 1995 was $229 and $283, respectively, on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 1 a risk
free interest rate of 55% in 1996 and 79% in 1995, 2 an expected life of 10
years for both 1996 and 1995, 3 volatility of approximately 359% for both
1996 and 1995 and 4 an annual dividend yield of 0% for both 1996 and 1995.                    43              VIATEL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

10 STOCK OPTION PLAN CONTINUED
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its Stock Incentive
Plan and, accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for its stock
options in the financial statements. Had the Company determined compensation
cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its stock options under SFAS
No. 123, the Company net loss would have been increased to the pro forma
amounts indicated below                             1996       1995
As reported net loss in 000s       $ 38,375   $ 28,476

As reported net loss per share          247     209
Pro forma net loss per share           251     210
Pro forma net loss reflects only options granted during 1996 and 1995.
Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost for stock options
under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma net loss amounts because
compensation cost is reflected over the options' vesting period of three years
and compensation cost for options granted prior to January 1, 1995 is not
considered.
