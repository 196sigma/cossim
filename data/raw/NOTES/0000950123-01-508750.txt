22          NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Except as indicated, amounts reflected in the consolidated financial
statements or the notes thereto relate to the continuing operations of Rockwell
International Corporation, now doing business under the name Rockwell Automation
Rockwell or the Company. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.
On June 29, 2001, the Company completed the spinoff of its Rockwell Collins
avionics and communications business and certain other assets and liabilities
into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company the Spinoff. In
connection with the Spinoff, all outstanding shares of Rockwell Collins, Inc.
Rockwell Collins were distributed to Rockwell shareowners on the basis of one
Rockwell Collins share for each outstanding Rockwell share. Commensurate with
the spinoff, Rockwell Collins made a special payment to the Company of $300
million. The net assets of Rockwell Collins as of June 29, 2001 of approximately
$12 billion including $300 million of debt incurred to make the special
payment to the Company were recorded as a decrease to shareowners' equity.
Following the Spinoff, each of Rockwell Collins and the Company has a 50 percent
ownership interest in Rockwell Scientific Company LLC RSCformerly known as
Rockwell Science Center.
On December 31, 1998, the Company completed the spinoff of its former
semiconductor systems business Semiconductor Systems into an independent,
separately traded, publicly held company by distributing all of the outstanding
shares of Conexant Systems, Inc. Conexant to the Company shareowners on a
pro-rata basis.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company has
control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated
in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, allowances
for doubtful accounts, excess and obsolete inventory, product warranty costs,
workers compensation, product and other self-insurance liabilities, employee
benefits, reserves and contingencies.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred: an
agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or
services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is
reasonably assured.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes time deposits and certificates of
deposit with original maturities of three months or less.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using first-in,
first-out FIFO or average methods. Market is determined on the basis of
estimated realizable values.
Property
Property is stated at cost. Depreciation of property is provided generally
using accelerated and straight-line methods over 15 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements and 3 to 14 years for machinery and equipment. Significant
renewals and betterments are capitalized and replaced units are written off.
Maintenance and repairs, as well as renewals of minor amounts, are charged to
expense.
Intangible Assets
Goodwill and other intangible assets generally result from business
acquisitions. The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the purchase
method by assigning the purchase price to tangible and intangible assets and
liabilities. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair
values, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned is
recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging
from 5 to 40 years. Trademarks, distributor networks, patents, and other
intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives, generally ranging from 5 to 40 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including goodwill, are reviewed for impairment when
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset
may not be recoverable, and for all assets to be disposed of. Long-lived assets
held for use are reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of an
asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset over its remaining useful life. If an asset is considered to be impaired,
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Management determines fair value using discounted future cash flow analysis or
other accepted valuation techniques.
Investments
Investments in affiliates over which the Company has the ability to exert
significant influence but does not control, including RSC, are accounted for
using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company proportional
share of the respective affiliate earnings or losses are included in other
income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES -- CONTINUED
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign
currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage
foreign currency and interest rate risks. Foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are used to hedge changes in the amount of future cash flows
associated with intercompany transactions generally forecasted to occur within
one year cash flow hedges and changes in fair value of certain assets and
liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third
parties denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swap contracts are
periodically used to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. The
Company accounting method for derivative financial instruments is based upon
the designation of such instruments as hedges under generally accepted
accounting principles. It is the policy of the Company to execute such
instruments with creditworthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. All foreign currency forward exchange
contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the United
States with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into
U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the end of the respective period. Sales,
costs and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective during the
respective period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Currency transaction gains
and losses are included in the results of operations in the period incurred.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees. Stock options are granted at prices equal to or greater than the fair
market value of the Company common stock on the grant dates, therefore no
compensation expense is recognized in connection with stock options granted to
employees. Compensation expense resulting from grants of restricted stock is
recognized generally during the period the service is performed.
Environmental Matters
The Company records accruals for environmental matters in the accounting
period in which its responsibility is established and the cost can be reasonably
estimated. Revisions to the accruals are made in the periods in which the
estimated costs of remediation change. At environmental sites in which more than
one potentially responsible party has been identified, the Company records a
liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement
with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the
involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in
which the Company is the only responsible party, the Company records a liability
for the total estimated costs of remediation. Costs of future expenditures for
environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value.
If recovery from insurers or other third parties is determined to be probable,
the Company records a receivable for the estimated recovery.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
The Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-10, Accounting
for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs EITF 00-10, on July 1, 2001. EITF
00-10 requires companies to classify shipping and handling amounts billed to
customers as sales. The Company has historically classified shipping and
handling amounts billed to customers as a reduction to cost of sales. Shipping
and handling amounts billed to customers which have been reclassified to sales
from cost of sales were $19 million in 2001, $20 million in 2000 and $17 million
in 1999. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Effective October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Securities and Exchange
Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements SAB 101. No accounting changes were required in connection with the
adoption of SAB 101 and, accordingly, the adoption had no effect on the
Company results of operations or shareowners' equity.
Effective July 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities SFAS 133. SFAS 133 requires the Company to record all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or
intent for holding them. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair
value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature
of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value is
immediately recognized in earnings. The effect of adopting SFAS 133 was not
material to the Company financial position, results of operations or
shareowners' equity.
New Accounting Standards
In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141,
Business Combinations SFAS 141, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142. SFAS 141 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for business combinations and requires that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
Under SFAS 142, goodwill and certain other intangible assets will no longer be
systematically amortized but instead will be reviewed for impairment and written
down and charged to results of operations when their carrying amount exceeds
their estimated fair value. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001, with early adoption permitted for entities with fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 2001. The Company expects to adopt SFAS 142
effective October 1, 2001. Management expects that the effect of ceasing
amortization of goodwill will increase net income by approximately $41 million
after tax, or 22 cents per diluted share, in fiscal 2002. The Company has not
completed its assessment of the additional effects of adopting SFAS 142.
In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144,
which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of
long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS 144 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, with early
adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS
144, but believes there will be no effect on the Company financial position,
results of operations or shareowners' equity resulting from the adoption.

3. SPECIAL CHARGES
In 2001, the Company recorded special charges of $91 million $60 million
after tax, or 32 cents per diluted share for costs associated with the
consolidation and closing of facilities, the realignment of administrative
functions, the reduction of workforce, primarily in North America, by
approximately 2,000 employees and asset impairments. The special charges are
reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended
September 30, 2001 in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative
expenses in the amounts of $50 million and $41 million, respectively. The
Company expects to be substantially complete with these actions in the first
quarter of 2002.
Total cash expenditures in connection with these actions are expected to
approximate $51 million. The Company spent approximately $17 million through
September 30, 2001 for employee severance and separation costs. In connection
with the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins assumed a liability for employee severance
and separation costs resulting from these actions of approximately $7 million.
As a result of actions taken through September 30, 2001, the workforce has been
reduced by approximately 1,400 employees.
The special charges included write-downs to the carrying amount of
goodwill, certain facilities and machinery and equipment totaling approximately
$26 million resulting from the decision to shut down certain facilities and exit
non-strategic operations. The charges represented the difference between the
fair values of the assets and their carrying values. Fair value was determined
by management on the basis of various customary valuation techniques.
Revenues and results of operations of businesses and product lines which
are being exited are not material.
The charges and their utilization for the year ended September 30, 2001 are
summarized as follows in millions                                  AMOUNTS  SEPTEMBER 30,

$91    $57      $34
The Company evaluates the adequacy of reserves recorded in prior years and
makes necessary revisions for changes in estimates in the periods in which they
occur. During 2001, the Company recorded an adjustment of $8 million as a
reduction of cost of sales and $2 million as a reduction of selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily as a result of lower than expected employee
separation and lease termination costs associated with actions taken in prior
years. The remaining balances at September 30, 2001 related to charges taken in
previous years were not significant.
4. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES
In October 2000, the Control Systems segment acquired the batch software
and services business of Sequencia Corporation. The purchase price for this
acquisition was $6 million which was allocated to intangible assets, including
developed technology and assembled workforce, and the excess of the purchase
price over the amounts assigned to intangible assets was recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill and the intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over approximately 5 years.

4. ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES -- CONTINUED
In March 2000, the Control Systems segment acquired Entek IRD International
Corporation Entek, a provider of machinery condition monitoring solutions. In
April 2000, the Control Systems segment acquired substantially all the assets
and assumed certain liabilities of Systems Modeling Corporation, a software
developer. The aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions was $70 million,
of which $61 million was allocated to intangible assets, including developed
technology, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to
tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Developed technology is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 5 years. Goodwill
related to the acquisitions of Entek and Systems Modeling Corporation is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 15 and 10 years, respectively.
During 1999, the Company acquired four businesses for an aggregate purchase
price of $185 million, of which $178 million was allocated to intangible assets.
Goodwill is being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
10 to 30 years, and the intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over 10 years.
Amounts recorded for liabilities assumed in connection with these
acquisitions were $1 million, $16 million and $41 million for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and, accordingly, the
results of operations of these businesses have been included in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations since their respective dates of acquisition. Pro forma
financial information is not presented as the combined effect of these
acquisitions was not material to the Company results of operations or
financial position.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company financial instruments include short- and long-term debt and
foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The fair value of short-term debt
approximates the carrying value due to its short-term nature. At September 30,
2001 and 2000, the carrying value of long-term debt was $923 million and $925
million, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt, based upon quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues, was $887 million and $843 million
at September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or
sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange
rates. At September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had outstanding foreign
currency forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of $738 million and
$852 million, respectively, primarily consisting of contracts for the euro,
pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc. Notional
amounts are stated in the U.S. dollar equivalents at spot exchange rates at the
respective dates. At September 30, 2001, the net carrying value of foreign
currency forward exchange contracts of $2 million was equal to its fair value
based upon quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. As of
September 30, 2001 and 2000, the foreign currency forward exchange contracts are
recorded in other current assets in the amounts of $11 million and $51 million,
respectively, and other current liabilities in the amounts of $9 million and $11
million, respectively. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse
effect on its results of operations or financial position relating to these
foreign currency forward exchange contracts. The Company has designated certain
foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to forecasted intercompany
transactions as cash flow hedges. The amount recognized in earnings as a result
of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges was not material.
In February 2000, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract
the Swap which effectively converted its $350 million aggregate principal
amount of 615% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on 90 day
LIBOR 542% at September 30, 2000. At September 30, 2000, the fair value of
the Swap, based upon quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities,
was approximately $13 million. On October 24, 2000, the Swap was terminated at a
net gain of $16 million. The gain is being amortized as a reduction of interest
expense over the remaining term of the 615% notes, payable in 2008.

12. SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY
Common Stock
At September 30, 2001, the authorized stock of the Company consisted of one
billion shares of common stock, par value $1 per share, and 25 million shares of
preferred stock, without par value. At September 30, 2001, 32 million shares of
common stock were reserved for various employee incentive plans.
Changes in outstanding common shares are summarized as follows in
millions                                2001  2000  1999

Ending  1837  1835  1909
For 2001, 2000 and 1999, dilutive stock options resulted in an increase in
average outstanding shares of 24 million, 21 million and 31 million,
respectively.
Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Each outstanding share of common stock provides the holder with one
Preferred Share Purchase Right Right. The Rights will become exercisable only
if a person or group, without the approval of the board of directors, acquires,
or offers to acquire, 20% or more of the common stock, although the board of
directors is authorized to reduce the 20% threshold for triggering the Rights to
not less than 10%. Upon exercise, each Right entitles the holder to 1/100th of a
share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock of the Company Junior
Preferred Stock at a price of $250, subject to adjustment.
Upon an acquisition of the Company, each Right other than Rights held by
the acquirer will generally be exercisable for $500 worth of either common
stock of the Company or common stock of the acquirer for $250. In certain
circumstances, each Right may be exchanged by the Company for one share of
common stock or 1/100th of a share of Junior Preferred Stock. The Rights will
expire on December 6, 2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed at $001 per
Right.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
Accumulated other comprehensive loss, including amounts related to Rockwell
Collins at September 30, 2000, consisted of the following in millions                                SEPTEMBER 30,

Accumulated other comprehensive loss. $162 $166
During 2001, unrealized gains on cash flow hedges of $22 million $15
million after tax were reclassified into earnings. Approximately $5 million of
the unrealized gains on cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings
during 2002. Management expects that these unrealized gains will be offset when
the hedged items are recognized in earnings.

14. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Company sponsors pension and other postretirement benefit plans for its
employees. The pension plans cover most of the Company employees and provide
for monthly pension payments to eligible employees upon retirement. Pension
benefits for salaried employees generally are based on years of credited service
and average earnings. Pension benefits for hourly employees generally are based
on specified benefit amounts and years of service. The Company policy is to
fund its pension obligations in conformity with the funding requirements of
applicable laws and governmental regulations. Other postretirement benefits are
in the form of retirement medical plans and cover most of the Company United
States employees and provide for the payment of certain medical costs of
eligible employees and dependents upon retirement.
In connection with the Spinoff, Rockwell Collins assumed the former
Rockwell International Corporation domestic qualified plan Rockwell Retirement
Plan. Pension plan obligations attributable to all of Rockwell domestic
active employees and former employees of the Control Systems, Power Systems and
Electronic Commerce businesses were retained by Rockwell and a proportionate
share of pension plan assets were transferred from the Rockwell Retirement Plan
to a new pension plan established by Rockwell. The Company also retained
liabilities for other postretirement benefits for active and former employees.

16. INCOME TAXES -- CONTINUED
Management believes it is more likely than not that current and long-term
deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable
income. Significant factors considered by management in its determination of the
probability of the realization of the deferred tax assets include: a the
historical operating results of the Company $453 million of United States
taxable income over the past three years, b expectations of future earnings,
and c the extended period of time over which the retirement medical liability
will be paid. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets
related to net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards
for which utilization is uncertain. The carryforward period for $1 million of
the net operating losses ends between 2002 and 2005. The carryforward period for
the remaining net operating losses is indefinite. The carryforward period for
all of the foreign tax credits ends in 2002.
The effective income tax rate differed from the United States statutory tax
rate for the reasons set forth below                                2001  2000  1999

The income tax provisions were calculated based upon the following
components of income from continuing operations before income taxes in
millions                                2001  2000  1999

Non-United States   81   97   95

No provision has been made for United States, state, or additional
non-United States income taxes related to approximately $239 million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended
to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the United States
federal income tax liability, if any, which would be payable if such earnings
were not permanently reinvested.
The Company United States income tax returns for the years 1995 through
1997 are currently under examination. In connection with the divestiture of the
Company aerospace and defense business the A Business, the spinoff of
the Company automotive components business Automotive, the Semiconductor
Systems spinoff, and the Rockwell Collins spinoff, the Company has retained all
tax liabilities and the right to all tax refunds related to United States and
certain non-U.S. operations of the A Business, Automotive, Semiconductor
Systems and Rockwell Collins for periods prior to the respective divestiture
dates. Management expects the examination of the Company 1995 through 1997 tax
years will be completed during 2002. Management believes adequate provision for
income taxes has been made for all years through 2001.

third parties under sublease agreements having noncancelable lease terms in
excess of one year aggregated $44 million as of September 30, 2001 and are
receivable through 2008 at approximately $6 million per year.
18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of
substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other
activities affecting the environment have and will continue to have an effect on
the manufacturing operations of the Company. Thus far, compliance with
environmental requirements and resolution of environmental claims has been
accomplished without material effect on the Company liquidity and capital
resources, competitive position or financial condition.
The Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party at 19
Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which the Company records disclose no
involvement or as to which the Company potential liability has been finally
determined or assumed by third parties. Management estimates the total
reasonably possible costs the Company could incur for the remediation of
Superfund sites at September 30, 2001 to be about $13 million, of which $9
million has been accrued.
Various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against
the Company alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental
protection requirements, or seeking remediation of alleged environmental
impairments, principally at previously owned properties. As of September 30,
2001, management has estimated the highest total reasonably possible costs the
Company could incur from these matters to be about $55 million. The Company has
recorded environmental accruals for these matters of $25 million. In addition to
the above matters, the Company assumed certain other environmental liabilities
in connection with the 1995 acquisition of Reliance Electric Company Reliance.
The Company is indemnified by ExxonMobil Corporation Exxon for substantially
all costs associated with these Reliance matters. At September 30, 2001, the
Company has recorded a liability of approximately $29 million and a receivable
of approximately $28 million for these Reliance matters. Management estimates
the highest total reasonably possible costs for these matters to be
approximately $37 million for which the Company is substantially indemnified by
Exxon.
Based on its assessment, management believes that the Company
expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to
comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other
expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company liquidity and capital resources, competitive
position or financial condition. Management cannot assess the possible effect of
compliance with future requirements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES -- CONTINUED
Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or
asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its business, including
those pertaining to product liability, intellectual property, safety and health,
employment and contract matters. In connection with the divestiture of the A
Business to The Boeing Company Boeing, Rockwell agreed to indemnify Boeing for
certain government contract and environmental matters related to operations of
the A Business for periods prior to the divestiture. In connection with the
spinoffs of Automotive, Semiconductor Systems and Rockwell Collins, the spun-off
companies have agreed to indemnify Rockwell for substantially all contingent
liabilities related to the respective businesses, including environmental and
intellectual property matters. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be
predicted with certainty and some lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be
disposed of unfavorably to the Company, management believes the disposition of
matters which are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on
the Company business or financial condition.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has divested certain of its
businesses. As a result of such divestitures, there may be lawsuits, claims or
proceedings instituted or asserted against the Company related to the period
that the businesses were owned by the Company. Management believes that any
judgments against the Company related to such matters would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company business or financial condition.

Other represents the sales and segment operating earnings of Rockwell
Science Center through the third quarter of 2001. Beginning with the fourth
quarter of 2001, the Company 50 percent ownership interest in RSC is accounted
for using the equity method, and the Company proportional share of RSC
earnings or losses are included in general corporate-net.
Among other considerations, the Company evaluates performance and allocates
resources based upon segment operating earnings before income taxes, interest
expense, costs related to corporate offices, nonrecurring special charges, gains
and losses from the disposition of businesses, earnings and losses from equity
affiliates, and incremental acquisition related expenses resulting from purchase
accounting adjustments such as goodwill and other intangible asset amortization,
depreciation, inventory and purchased research and development charges. The
accounting policies used in preparing the segment information are consistent
with those described in Note 1. Special charges are discussed in Note 3.
Effective October 1, 2001, management changed its method of evaluating
segment performance to exclude from segment operating earnings all purchase
accounting items, including depreciation and intangible asset amortization.
Management believes the exclusion of these items provides additional insight
into the operating performance of the segments.
