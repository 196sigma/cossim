Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm and our Consolidated
Financial Statements as of June30, 2006 and 2005, and for each of the years in the three year
period ended June30, 2006, follow 62 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries
Norcross, Georgia We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006,
based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from their assessment the internal control
over financial reporting at PhoneCharge, Inc. PhoneCharge, which was acquired on January1,
2006 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 64percent and
25percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for
the year ended June30, 2006. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over
financial reporting at PhoneCharge. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of June30, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June30, 2006,
based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of CheckFree Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of June30, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for the year ended June30, 2006, and the consolidated
financial statement schedule listed in the index at , and our report dated 63 Table of Contents September 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share Based Payment. Atlanta, Georgia
September8, 2006 64 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries
Norcross, Georgia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CheckFree Corporation and
Subsidiaries as of June30, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June30, 2006.
Our audit also included the financial statement schedule, listed in the Index at . These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of CheckFree Corporation and Subsidiaries at June30, 2006 and
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended June30, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered
in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share Based Payment, effective July1, 2005, based on
the modified prospective application transition method. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting
as of June30, 2006, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
September 8, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment of the effectiveness
of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Atlanta, Georgia

See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 70 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES All references to we, us and our in this Annual Report on Form 10-K mean CheckFree
Corporation and all entities owned or controlled by CheckFree Corporation, except where it is made
clear that the term only means the parent company. Organization CheckFree Corporation is the parent company of CheckFree Services Corporation
CheckFree Services, the principal operating company of our business. CheckFree Services was
founded in 1981 and is a leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services.
See Note 20 for a description of our business segments. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
results of our operations and the results of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Our majority owned
subsidiary, CheckFree Management Corporation, merged into CheckFree Services Corporation effective
June30, 2004. We have eliminated all significant intercompany transactions. Use of Estimates The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP. The
preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during our reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Investments We have certain investments in marketable debt securities that are classified as
available-for-sale in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS 115. Beginning with
the quarter ended September30, 2002, we started investing in available-for-sale securities. Our
available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded as
unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet. We have certain other investments in venture capital investment portfolio funds as well as equity
and debt securities that are accounted for under the cost method. Under the cost method of
accounting, investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines
in fair value, distributions of earnings and additional investments. We periodically evaluate
whether declines in fair value of our other investments are other-than-temporary. In performing
this evaluation, we consider various factors including any decline in market price, and where
available, the investees financial condition, results of operations, operating trends and other
financial ratios. We have received equity instruments in connection with agreements with certain partners. In such
cases, our initial cost was determined based on the estimated fair value of the equity instruments
received. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these equity instruments are accounted for in
accordance with the investment policies described above. In April2004, we announced a joint venture, OneVu Limited OneVu, with Voca Limited Voca,
in the United Kingdom to create an integrated electronic billing and payment network for billers
and banks in the United Kingdom. We have a 50% equity interest in OneVu, therefore, we account for
our interest in OneVu under the equity method of accounting. We provided 100% of OneVus necessary
working capital requirements during its formative stage, and therefore, the equity in net loss of
OneVu represents 100% of the loss incurred by OneVu through March31, 2006. In March2006, we
entered into an additional funding arrangement with Voca related to OneVu whereby both joint
venture partners contributed approximately $830,000 in exchange for a security interest subordinate
to our previous funding. OneVu obtained a line of credit facility from a bank in the amount of
approximately $27million. Accordingly, beginning in April2006, we continued to record the
operations of OneVu on the equity basis of accounting recognizing only 50% of the results of
operations of OneVu. During the three years ended June30, 2006, we invested $7,220,000 in the joint venture. 71 Table of Contents Settlement Assets and Obligations Amounts receivable from our agents and clients, as well as
amounts payable to our agents and clients associated with our walk-in payment services, are
classified as settlement assets and obligations. The majority of these assets and obligations
result from timing differences between our agents collecting funds from the consumers making the
payments and depositing the funds collected into our bank accounts. Settlement assets and
obligations arise due to our reporting of transactions to our clients prior to fulfilling the
payment obligation. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations
of credit risk consist of cash, investments and trade accounts receivable. Excess cash is invested
through banks, mutual funds and brokerage houses primarily in highly liquid securities. We have
investment policies and procedures that limit any concentration of credit risk with single issuers.
With respect to accounts receivable, we do not generally require collateral and believe that any
credit risk is substantially mitigated by the nature of our customers and reasonably short
collection terms. We maintain reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when
deemed necessary. Derivative Financial Instruments On July1, 2000, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended SFAS 133, which requires that all derivative
financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair
value. Derivatives that are not hedges are adjusted to fair value through our consolidated
statement of operations. If the derivative qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the
hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives are either offset against the change in fair value
of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet,
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change
in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. We do not enter into derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Property and equipment are
depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows: land
improvements, building and building improvements, 15 to 30years; computer equipment, software and
furniture, 18months to seven years. Equipment under capital leases is amortized using the
straight-line method over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or remaining
lease periods. Capitalized Software Capitalized software includes purchased technology associated with
acquisitions and capitalized internal development costs. Purchased technology is initially
recorded based on the fair value ascribed at the time of acquisition. Internal development costs
are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of either SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86 or Statement of Position
SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use SOP 98-1. Unamortized capitalized software costs in excess of estimated future net
realizable values from a particular product are written down to estimated net realizable value. We
determine whether software costs fall under the provisions of SFAS 86 or SOP 98-1 and account for
them as follows   
SFAS 86 Software development costs incurred prior to the
establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as
incurred. Software development costs incurred after the
technological feasibility of the subject software product has been
established are capitalized in accordance with SFAS 86.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product
basis using either the estimated economic life of the product on a
straight-line basis over three to five years, or the current year
gross product revenue to the current and anticipated future gross
product revenue, whichever produces the greater annual
amortization.   
SOP 98-1 Software costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage are expensed as incurred. Software costs incurred after the
preliminary project stage is complete, we have committed to the
project, and it is probable the software will be used to perform
the function intended are capitalized in accordance with SOP 98-1.
Capitalized software costs are amortized on a product-by-product
basis using the estimated economic life of the product on a
straight-line basis, generally three to five years. Capitalized
software costs not expected to be completed and placed in service
are written down to estimated fair value. 72 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over
the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Other intangibles represent identifiable intangible assets purchased in connection with business
combinations. The costs of identified intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods from eight months to ten years. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review on April30 of each year. No indicators for
impairment were evident during our review for fiscal year 2006. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets In accordance with SFAS 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144, we review long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. In such reviews, estimated
undiscounted future cash flows associated with these assets or operations are compared with their
carrying value to determine if a write-down to fair value is required normally measured by the
expected present value technique. Transaction Processing In connection with the timing of our financial transaction processing, we
are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by other parties, such as returns. We
utilize credit analysis and other controls to manage our credit risk exposure. We also maintain a
reserve for future returns. This reserve is included in accounts receivable on our consolidated
balance sheet. Comprehensive Income Loss We report comprehensive income lossin accordance with SFAS 130,
Reporting Comprehensive Income
SFAS130. This Statement requires disclosure of total non-shareowner
changes in equity and its components. Total non-shareowner changes in equity include all changes
in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by and distributions to
shareowners. The components of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet, applicable to us are unrealized gains or
losses of available-for-sale securities and derivative instruments, as well as unrealized foreign
currency translation differences. Beginning with the quarter ended September30, 2002, we started
investing in available-for-sale securities, and during fiscal year 2004, we amended our investment
policy to allow for the use of derivative financial instruments in certain instances. As of June
30, 2006, unrealized foreign currency translation losses of $59,000, gross unrealized gains of
$86,000 offset by gross unrealized loss of $2,336,000 from our available-for-sale securities, net
of deferred taxes of $823,000, and unrealized loss on interest rate swaps of $167,000, net of
deferred taxes of $60,000, have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a
component of stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet. Stock-Based Compensation On July1, 2005, we adopted, SFAS 123R, Share Based
Payment SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method. SFAS 123R requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and shares purchased
under an associate stock purchase plan if certain parameters are not met, to be recognized in the
financial statements based on their fair values and did not change the accounting guidance for
share-based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in SFAS 123,
Accounting for Stock Based Compensation SFAS 123, as originally issued and Emerging Issues
Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than
Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or
Services EITF96-18. SFAS 123R did not
address the accounting for employee share ownership plans, which are subject to SOP 93-6, Employers Accounting for
Employee Stock Ownership Plans SOP93-6. Upon our adoption of SFAS 123R, we began recording compensation cost related to stock options
that were unvested as of July1, 2005, as well as for all new stock option grants after our
adoption date. The compensation cost to be recorded is based on the fair value at the grant date.
The adoption of SFAS 123R did not have an effect on our recognition of compensation expense
relating to the vesting of restricted stock grants. SFAS 123R required the elimination of
unearned compensation contra-equity account related to earlier awards against the appropriate
equity accounts of our consolidated balance sheet. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, cash flows resulting from the tax benefit related to
equity-based compensation was presented in our operating cash flows, along with other tax cash
flows, in accordance with the provisions of EITF 00-15, Classification in the Statement of Cash
Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee
Stock Option EITF 00-15. SFAS 123R superseded EITF 00-15, amended 73 Table of Contents SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows and requires tax benefits relating to excess equity-based
compensation deductions to be prospectively presented in our statement of cash flows as financing
cash inflows. Had compensation cost for our stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair
value at the grant dates for awards under those plans in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123, our net income lossand net income lossper share would have been as follows in

74 Table of Contents Stock-Related Transactions With Third Parties We account for stock warrants issued to third
parties, including customers, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R, EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees
for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services EITF 96-18 and EITF 01-9,
Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer Including a Reseller of the Vendors
Products EITF 01-9. Under the provisions of EITF 96-18, because none of the agreements have
a disincentive for non-performance, we record a charge for the fair value of the portion of the
warrants earned from the point in time when vesting of the warrants becomes probable. Final
determination of fair value of the warrants occurs upon actual vesting. EITF 01-9, which became
effective for us during the quarter ended March31, 2002, requires that the fair value of certain
types of warrants issued to customers be recorded as a reduction of revenue to the extent of
cumulative revenue recorded from that customer. Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share We report basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 128, Earnings Per Share SFAS 128. Basic earnings per common
share is determined by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding. Diluted per common share amounts assume the issuance of
common stock for all potentially dilutive equivalent shares outstanding. Foreign Currency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for most of our
businesses. Significant operations with a local currency as functional currency include operations
in the United Kingdom, Canada, European Union, and Australia. Foreign currency denominated assets
and liabilities for these operations are translated into U.S. dollars based on exchange rates
prevailing at the end of the period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange
rates during the period. The effects of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the
translation of assets and liabilities of those entities where the functional currency is not the
U.S. dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet. Realized gains and losses from currency
exchange transactions are recorded in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of
operations and were not material to our consolidated results of operations for fiscal years 2006,
2005 and 2004. Revenue Recognition Our sources of revenue and methodology of recognition is as follows   
Processing and servicing Processing and servicing includes revenues from transaction
processing, electronic funds transfer and monthly service fees on consumer funds transfer
services. We recognize revenues when the services have been performed. Certain customer
agreements include minimum monthly revenue commitments to us and; of those agreements, some
have provisions that allow these minimum commitments to be credited against future services,
as defined. We defer any portion of the minimum revenue commitments that we expect to be
credited against future services until the future services are performed or the credits expire
unused. Our estimate of minimums to be credited against future services is primarily based on
customer specific historical experience and volume and growth experience with other customers.
Transaction fees related to our walk-in payment operations are recorded gross of agent
commissions if we are required to invoice our customers for such fees and remit the commission
to our agents.   
As part of processing certain types of transactions, we earn interest from the time money is
collected from our customers until the time payment is made to the applicable merchants. These
revenues, which are generated from trust account balances not included on our consolidated
balance sheets, are included in our processing and servicing revenues and totaled $41,643,000 26,648,000 and $14,813,000 for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.   
License fees We recognize revenues on software transactions in accordance with SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by SOP 98-9, Modification of SOP
97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions and SOP 81-1,
Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, based
on the terms and conditions in the contract. In accordance with the provisions of SOP 97-2,
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when there is persuasive evidence
that an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectibility is probable and
the software has been delivered, provided that no significant obligation remains under the
contract. We have multiple-element software arrangements which in addition to software
typically also include 75 Table of Contents   
professional services and maintenance services. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue
using the residual method. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered
elements, based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value, is deferred. The difference
between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is
recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements. We determine the fair value of the
undelivered elements based the amounts charged when those elements are sold separately.
Contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method are generally measured based
on the ratio of labor costs incurred to total estimated labor costs to be incurred. Changes in
estimates to complete and revisions in overall profit estimates on these contracts are charged
to earnings in the period in which they are determined. We accrue for contract losses if and
when the current estimate of total contract costs exceeds total contract revenue.   
Maintenance fees We recognize maintenance fee revenues ratably
over the term of the related contractual support period, generally
12months.   
Professional fees Other revenues consists primarily of
consulting and training services. We recognize consulting
revenues as services are performed and training revenues are
recognized upon delivery of the related services. Our customers are billed in accordance with contract terms. Maintenance is generally billed on an
annual basis. We record any unrecognizable portion of billed fees as deferred revenue until such
time as revenue recognition is appropriate. Credit losses, if any, are contemplated in the
establishment of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Advertising Costs We expense advertising
costs as incurred in accordance with SOP93-7,
Reporting on Advertising Costs SOP 93-7. Advertising expense for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and
2004 were $5,971,000, $6,064,000 and $3,632,000, respectively. Advertising expenses are included
in sales and marketing costs in our consolidated statements of operations. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes SFAS 109, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and
reporting for income taxes. In accordance with SFAS 109, deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on
enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to
affect taxable income. Income tax expense benefitis the tax payable or refundable for the
period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Business Segments We report information
about our business segments in accordance with SFAS 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information SFAS131. The Statement defines how
operating segments are determined and requires disclosure of certain financial and descriptive
information about a companys operating segments. See Note 20 for our segment information. Related Parties We consider certain entities to be related parties as defined by SFAS 57,
Related Party Disclosures SFAS57,
based on the ability to designate for election a director to our board of directors as
well as the level of share ownership. First Data Corporation FDC was considered a related
party until the beginning of our quarter ended September30, 2004. Bank of America was considered a
related party from October2000 to January2003. Microsoft Corporation
Microsoft was considered
a related party in each of the three years in the period ending June30, 2006. On August29, 2006,
we entered into an agreement with Microsoft terminating its stockholder agreement, dated
September1, 2000, that gave Microsoft the right to designate for election a director to our board.
As a result of the termination, Microsoft is no longer considered a related party for financial
statement purposes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In July2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued FASB Interpretation FIN No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48,
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This Interpretation requires that
we recognize in our financial statements, the impact of a tax position, if that position is more
likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. The
provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative
effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained
earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting FIN 48 on our consolidated financial
statements. 76 Table of Contents In March2006, the FASB issued SFAS No156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets
SFAS 156. SFAS 156 provides relief for entities that use derivatives to economically hedge
fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are
computed in certain transfers or securitizations. SFAS 156 is effective as of the beginning of the
first fiscal year that begins after September15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 156
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In February2006, the FASB issued SFAS No155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments SFAS 155. SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to
be accounted for as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host, if the
holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. This Statement is
effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first
fiscal year that begins after September15, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have
a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In November2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments FSP 115-1, which
provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are
considered impaired, whether that impairment is other-than-temporary, and on measuring such
impairment loss. FSP 115-1 also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of
an other-than-temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that
have not been recognized as other-than-temporary impairments. FSP 115-1 is required to be applied
to reporting periods beginning after December15, 2005 and was adopted by us during the third
quarter of fiscal 2006. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. In March2005, the FASB issued FIN No47 Accounting for Conditional Assets Retirement
ObligationsAn Interpretation of FASB Statement No143 FIN 47. FIN 47 requires an entity to
recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred
if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 is effective no later than the
end of fiscal years ending after December15, 2005, and, therefore, is applicable for the year
ended June30, 2006. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. EITF Issue No06-3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities
Should Be Presented in the Income Statement That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation EITF
06-3, requires that entities should present these taxes in the income statement on either a gross
or net basis, based on their accounting policy. If such taxes are significant, and are presented
on a gross basis, the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed. The consensus is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2006. We are currently
evaluating the impact of adopting EITF 06-3 on our consolidated financial statements. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the prior years financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to the fiscal year 2006 presentation. NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES PhoneCharge, Inc. In January2006, we completed the acquisition of PhoneCharge, Inc. PhoneCharge, a provider of

risk management solutions for banks, brokerages and corporations. 78 Table of Contents Accurate, a United Kingdom-based provider of reconciliation, exception management, workflow and
business intelligence solutions, is part of our Software Division. We treated this acquisition as a
purchase for accounting purposes, and, accordingly, we recorded assets and liabilities based on
their fair market values at the date of the acquisition. Based on the purchase price allocation, we
recorded goodwill of approximately $40,064,000, not deductible for tax purposes. As a direct
result of our acquisition of Accurate, we recorded a charge in the amount of $1,039,000 to write
down the value of previously capitalized software due to technology redundancy. This charge is
included in depreciation and amortization within our consolidated statement of operations for the

was part of our Investment Services Division, for $18,593,000 in cash, subject to post-closing
adjustments. The sale was the result of an unsolicited offer and resulted in a gain on disposal of
$12,821,000. As a result of this disposition, the operating results of the M-Solutions business
for the current and prior periods through the disposition date have been reclassified as
discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes. M-Solutions

The fair value of available-for-sale securities is based on quoted market values or estimates from
independent pricing services. 80 Table of Contents We have determined that the unrealized losses in our available-for-sale investments, comprised of
140 and 135 securities, are deemed to be temporary impairments as of June30, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. We believe that the unrealized losses generally are caused by increases in market
interest rates rather than adverse changes in cash flows or a fundamental weakness in the credit
quality of the issuer or underlying assets. We believe that the investments full principal will be
returned to us at maturity. The following table summarizes the aggregate amount of cost or
amortized cost, gross unrealized losses, and estimated fair values of these investments classified
as available-for-sale as of June30, 2006 and 2005 in thousands

Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because debt issuers may have the right
to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. We classify, in our
consolidated balance sheet, our investments based on their expected maturities rather than
contractual maturities. During the quarter ended March31, 2005, we began classifying
our auction rate preferred and debt instruments as available-for-sale rather than as cash and cash
equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet. As of June30, 2006 and 2005, we had approximately
$78,000,000 and $79,150,000 in auction rate securities, respectively. In 2006, we sold available-for-sale investments of approximately $466,011,000. We recognized no
gross gains or gross losses on those sales. In 2005, we sold available-for-sale investments of
approximately $262,704,000. We recognized gross gains of $4,000 and gross losses of $40,000 on
those sales. In 2004, we sold available-for-sale securities of approximately $255,972,000. We
recognized gross gains of $247,000 and gross losses of $484,000 on those sales. The amount of the net unrealized holding gains or losseson available-for-sale securities
included in accumulated other comprehensive income lossas of June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was
$1,427,000, $412,000 and $238,000, respectively. The amount of losses reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income lossinto earnings for the fiscal years ended June30,
2006, 2005 and 2004 was $0, $24,000 and $210,000, respectively. We use the specific identification
method to determine the basis on which the cost of a security is sold or the amount that we
reclassify out of the accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders
equity of our consolidated balance sheet, into earnings. 82 Table of Contents In the quarter ended March31, 2005, we recorded a $592,000 gain on the sale of stock. While
we do not typically invest in equity securities, we received shares of stock from an insurance
vendor that demutualized. We sold the shares shortly after we received them, and recorded the
proceeds as a gain on investments. In April2004, we transferred all of our held-to-maturity investments to the available-for-sale
category. We determined that we no longer had the positive intent to hold our investment in
securities classified as held-to-maturity for an indefinite period of time due to our desire to
have more flexibility in managing our investment portfolio. The securities transferred had a total
amortized cost of $43,769,000, fair value of $43,842,000 and unrealized gross gains of $514,000 and
unrealized gross losses of $441,000 at the time of the transfer. The net unrealized gain of $73,000
was recorded within the accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of our
stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet, at the time of transfer. Other investments We account for other investments under the cost method. Our other investments
include common stock, warrants and venture capital initiatives. The common stocks and warrants
consist of preferred stock warrants in a non-publicly traded electronic billing related company.
The fair value of our investments was approximately $110,000 as of June30, 2006 and 2005. Our venture capital investments are in early to mid-stage financial solutions and technology
companies. We have made a commitment to invest $1,000,000 and $4,000,000 in two separate venture
capital initiatives. Actual contributions are made at the point in time a specific company in
which venture capital will be invested is identified. The fair value of our venture capital
initiative with a $1,000,000 commitment was approximately $649,000 and $721,000 as of June30, 2006
and 2005. The cost and fair value of our venture capital initiative with a $4,000,000 commitment
was approximately $569,000 and $87,000 as of June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pledged investments We have pledged certain available-for-sale investments as collateral for
payments due under our operating leases and have three standby letters of credit related to our
operating leases. In conjunction with our operating leases, the total amount of our collateralized
available-for-sale investments and standby letters of credit at June30, 2006 and 2005 was
approximately $2,383,000 and $2,953,000, respectively. The standby letters of credit associated
with our operating leases expire at various dates through April2007 but automatically renew yearly
through the underlying lease expiration dates. Our operating leases expire at various dates through
December2015. NOTE 4. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The components of our accounts receivable consist of the following in thousands

Trade accounts receivable represents amounts billed to our customers. We recognize revenues and
bill customers under service agreements as we perform services. Unbilled trade accounts receivable
result primarily from extended payment terms not in excess of one year on software license
agreements. For software contracts, we recognize revenues under the provisions of SOP 97-2 as
described in Note 1, and unbilled amounts under those software contracts are billed on specific
dates according to contractual terms. Other receivables are comprised primarily of interest
receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of uncollectible accounts
receivable. 83 Table of Contents NOTE 5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The components of our property and equipment are as follows in thousands

purchase price allocation, we recorded goodwill of approximately $67,813,000. In October2005, we completed our acquisition of Aphelion, Inc. and, based on the preliminary
purchase price allocation, we recorded goodwill of approximately $10,653,000. In September2005, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Integrated
Decision Systems, Inc. and, based on the preliminary purchase price allocation, we recorded
goodwill of approximately $8,019,000. In April2005, we completed our acquisition of Accurate and, based on the preliminary purchase
price allocation, we recorded goodwill of approximately $40,882,000. In December2005, we made a
final purchase price adjustment of $818,000 to record deferred taxes related to net operating
losses which became available to us. As of June30, 2006 and 2005, our
only non-amortizing intangible asset is goodwill. The impact of

85 Table of Contents NOTE 8. FINANCING AGREEMENTS In August2003, our wholly
owned subsidiaries, CheckFree Services and Bastogne, Inc., a
bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity Bastogne, entered into a Master
Agreement with
SunTrust Banks, Atlanta, Georgia SunTrust with respect to activities in our
Electronic Commerce
Division. Under this Master Agreement, SunTrust provides us with Automated Clearing House ACH
and other electronics funds transfer services, on behalf of Bastogne in connection with the
receipt, investment, custody and transmission of subscriber funds. In addition, SunTrust and
its affiliates provide us with various deposit accounts and investment accounts and services to
Bastogne. CheckFree Services provides processing and administrative services to Bastogne to
facilitate transactions under the Master Agreement. SunTrust has agreed to provide a facility to Bastogne to cover overdrafts occurring from time to
time due to timing differences between transmission of subscriber funds and movement of funds from
Bastognes investment accounts to the zero balance demand deposit account maintained by Bastogne
with SunTrust. In addition, SunTrust provides ACH services, and maintains and permits Bastogne to
use SunTrusts MasterCard ICA transit number and VISA bank identification numbers to facilitate
transactions in the MasterCard and VISA systems. The obligations of Bastogne under the Master
Agreement to SunTrust are guaranteed by CheckFree Services. Line of Credit On April13, 2006, we entered into a revolving credit facility with SunTrust that provides for up
to $300,000,000 in revolving credit loans, swingline loans and the issuance of letters of credit.
The credit facility terminates on April13, 2011, unless terminated earlier. Any borrowings will
bear interest at certain rates based upon our then current ratio of total debt to consolidated
EBITDA. The credit facility also requires the payment of a commitment fee, expressed as a
percentage per annum on any unused commitment. The credit facility contains certain financial covenants requiring us to meet certain financial
ratios and contains certain operating covenants which, among other things, impose certain
limitations with respect to additional indebtedness, investments, dividends and prepayments of
subordinated indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, mergers and consolidations,
liens and other matters customarily addressed in such agreements. The credit facility also contains
customary events of default, including payment defaults, material inaccuracies in representations
and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain other agreements, certain events of
bankruptcy and insolvency, certain ERISA events, judgment defaults in excess of specified amounts,
failure of any guaranty supporting the credit facility to be in full force and effect, and a change
in control. Simultaneously with entering into the revolving credit facility, we terminated our
existing $185,000,000 credit facility, originally entered into on August20, 2004. This terminated
facility was scheduled to expire on August20, 2007. All collateral securing our terminated
facility was released upon its ending. Data Center Facility On April13, 2006, we entered into a series of financing and leasing arrangements the
Agreements with a consortium of banks for the purpose of funding the construction of up to two
data centers. We will record the construction of the data centers as construction in progress
during the construction period and will begin to record depreciation once we have assumed
occupancy. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, SunTrust is required to purchase a fee simple
interest in certain parcels of real property the Properties specified by CheckFree Services,
and CheckFree Services, as construction agent for SunTrust, is required to construct data center
facilities the Facilities on the Properties. The funding for the acquisition of the Properties
and the construction of the Facilities will be provided by SunTrust and certain financial
institutions. The aggregate limit on the funding to be provided by SunTrust and the financial
institutions is $100,000,000. As of June30, 2006, we have borrowed $3,331,000 against this
facility at an average interest rate of 5859%. During construction and after completion of the Facilities, SunTrust will lease the Properties and
the Facilities to CheckFree Services pursuant to the terms of the Agreements. CheckFree Services
will make minimum lease payments, representing the interest charge on the outstanding balance,
beginning upon completion of construction that will vary based on the London Interbank Offered Rate
LIBOR plus a spread. The lease agreements will expire on April12, 2013, unless terminated
earlier pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements. 86 Table of Contents Upon expiration of the Agreements, CheckFree Services must elect to: ipurchase the Facilities
and Properties from SunTrust for a defined amount; iirequest a five year renewal of the lease
agreements maximum of two such five year renewals provided for, subject to the approval and
consent of SunTrust and the Lenders; or iiisell the Facilities and Properties as agent for
SunTrust, provided that certain conditions are satisfied the Remarketing Option. If CheckFree Services chooses the Remarketing Option, various outcomes may occur under the
Agreements, but if the net cash proceeds of any sale are less than an amount equal to the aggregate
sum of the outstanding amounts funded by SunTrust and all other lenders, all accrued and unpaid
interest on the loans, all unpaid fees owing to SunTrust and any other lender under the operative
documents, and all other amounts owing to SunTrust and all other lenders under the lease agreements
the Outstanding Amounts, CheckFree Services will be required to pay SunTrust the difference
between the sale proceeds and the Outstanding Amounts, but in no event more than approximately
eighty-three percent 83% of the Outstanding Amounts. If the net proceeds received from a third
party for the Properties and Facilities, or a given Property and Facility, are in excess of the
Outstanding Amounts or the Outstanding Amounts related to the specific Property and Facility, the
excess shall be paid to CheckFree Services. SunTrust or the Agent may reject a third party purchase
offer for the Properties and Facilities or a given Property and Facility under certain conditions. The Agreements contain certain financial covenants requiring us to meet certain financial ratios
and contains certain operating covenants which, among other things, impose certain limitations with
respect to additional indebtedness, investments, dividends and prepayments of subordinated
indebtedness, transactions with affiliates, asset sales, mergers and consolidations, liens and
other matters customarily addressed in such agreements. We are in compliance with our covenants as
of June30, 2006. NOTE 9. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES On November29, 1999, we issued $172,500,000 of 65% convertible subordinated notes that were due
on December1, 2006. In December2003, we redeemed the notes. The $172,500,000 principal
amount, along with a call premium of $4,813,000, was paid in cash. In addition, we incurred a
non-cash charge of $2,407,000 due to the write off of the remaining unamortized bond issuance
costs. These amounts are included in interest expense for the year ended June30, 2004. NOTE 10. CAPITAL LEASE AND OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS We lease certain equipment under capital leases and purchase certain software licenses under
long-term agreements. We are required to pay certain taxes, insurance and other expenses related

On April2, 2004, we received a $25,000,000 deposit from a customer in connection with a contract
modification relating to the timing of transaction settlements. The agreement has an initial term
of four years and automatically renews thereafter unless terminated with 180days notice. During
the term of the agreement, we are required to pay the customer a variable rate of interest on a
monthly basis equal to the then current overnight repurchase agreement rate. The deposit is
reflected as a long-term liability in our consolidated balance sheets. There are no restrictions
on the deposit, and the funds are available to us for general use. The deposit will be refunded to
our customer upon termination of the agreement. NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating
Leases We lease office space and equipment under operating leases. Certain leases
contain renewal options and generally provide that we are required to pay for insurance, taxes and
maintenance. In addition, certain leases include rent escalations throughout the terms of the
lease. Total expense under all operating lease agreements for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005
and 2004 was $20,918,000, $19,895,000 and $23,500,000, respectively. Future minimum rental payments as of June30, 2006 under these leases are as follows in

We have pledged certain available-for-sale investments as collateral for payments due under our
operating leases and have three standby letters of credit related to our operating leases. In
conjunction with our operating leases, the total amount of our collateralized available-for-sale
investments and standby letters of credit at June30, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $2,383,000
and $2,953,000, respectively. The standby letters of credit associated with our operating leases
expire at various dates through April2007 but automatically renew yearly through the underlying
lease expiration dates. Our operating leases expire at various dates through December2015. Guarantees  In connection with our MSFDC, L.L.C. TransPoint acquisition, we entered
into commercial agreements with Microsoft and FDC to provide payment processing services. These
agreements included minimum guaranteed revenue commitments totaling $180,000,000 over five years.
The monthly minimum commitments from Microsoft and FDC increased over the five year term of the
agreements and expired during the fiscal year 2006. FASB Interpretation 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others FIN 45, requires that a guarantor
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The following is a summary of agreements that we have
determined to be within the scope of FIN 45   
1
We warrant that our software products will perform in all material respects
in accordance with our standard published specifications in effect at the time of
delivery of the licensed products to the customer for 90days. Additionally, we
warrant that our services will be performed consistent with generally 88 Table of Contents   
accepted industry standards or specific service levels through completion of the agreed
upon services. If necessary, we would provide for the estimated cost of product and
service warranties based on specific warranty claims and claim history, however, we have
not incurred significant recurring expense under our product or service warranties. As a
result, we believe the estimated liabilities related to these agreements are not
material.   
2
CheckFree Services guarantees the obligations of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. See
Note 8. We have entered into the following guarantees related to our walk-in payment operations. The
transmittal of consumer funds for three customers is guaranteed. We have issued bonds and letters
of credit totaling $20,635,000 on behalf of consumers in the event that consumer funds are not
remitted to billers. Historically, payments made related to us settling claims under these
arrangements have not been significant. As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of any
unsettled claims is nominal. Accordingly, we have no liabilities recorded for these arrangements as
of June30, 2006. Litigation We are party to a number of claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business.
In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not
have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity or results of operations. NOTE 12. CAPITAL STOCK On November1, 2000, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares from
165,000,000 to 550,000,000, consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $01 par value,
48,500,000 shares of preferred stock, $01 par value, and 1,500,000 shares of SeriesA Junior
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, $01 par value. The preferred stock may be issued in one
or more series and may be established with such relative voting, dividend, redemption, liquidation,
conversion and other powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions as
our board of directors may determine without further stockholder approval. No preferred shares
have been issued through June30, 2006. On December16, 1997, our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of Preferred Share
Purchase Rights Rights to protect our stockholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to
acquire us. On December19, 1997, the Rights were issued to our stockholders of record, with an
expiration date of December16, 2007. Until a person or group acquires 15% or more of
our common stock, the Rights will automatically trade with our shares of common stock. Only when a
person or group has acquired 15% or more of our common stock, will the Rights become exercisable
and separate certificates issued. Prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial
ownership of 15% or more of our common stock, the Rights are redeemable for $001 per Right at the
option of our board of directors. NOTE 13. TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING EQUITY INSTRUMENTS Employee Plans During 1995, we adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan the 1995 Plan. The options granted under the
1995 Plan may be either incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options. The terms of the
options granted under the 1995 Plan are at the sole discretion of a committee of members of our
board of directors, not to exceed ten years. Generally, options vest at either 33% or 20% per year
from the date of grant. The 1995 Plan originally provided us with the ability of granting options
for not more than 5,000,000 shares of common stock to certain of our key employees, officers and
directors. In November1998 and again in November2000, the 1995 Plan was amended by a vote of our
shareholders to extend the maximum option grants to not more than 8,000,000 shares and not more
than 12,000,000 shares, respectively. Options granted under the 1995 Plan are exercisable
according to the terms of each option, however, in the event of a change in control or merger as
defined, the options shall become immediately exercisable. In November2002, our stockholders approved the 2002 Stock Incentive Plan the 2002 Plan. Under
the provisions of the 2002 Plan, we have the ability to grant incentive or non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights SARs, restricted stock, performance units or performance
shares for not more than 6,000,000 shares of common stock such shares to be supplied from the
12,000,000 shares approved for the 1995 Plan to certain of our key employees, officers and
non-employee directors. The terms of the options, SARs, restricted stock, performance units 89 Table of Contents or performance shares granted under the 2002 Plan are determined by a committee of our Board
of Directors, however, in the event of a change in control as defined in the 2002 Plan, they shall
become immediately exercisable. The 2002 Plan replaced the 1995 Plan, except that the 1995 Plan
continues to exist to the extent that options granted prior to the effective date of the 2002 Plan
continue to remain outstanding. At June30, 2006, there were 3,160,107 additional shares available
for grant under the 2002 Plan. In the event that shares purchased through the exercise of incentive stock options are sold within
one year of exercise, we are entitled to a tax deduction. The tax benefit of the deduction is not
reflected in our consolidated statements of operations but is reflected as an increase in
additional paid-in capital. As of June30, 2006, we have four types of share-based payment arrangements with our associates;
stock options, restricted stock, associate stock purchase plan, and our 401k match see Note 15. Stock Options The following tables summarize the activity of stock options under our 1995 and 2002 Plans from

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in the years
ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively: dividend yield of 0% in all periods; expected
volatility of 50%, 55% and 61% risk-free interest rates of 467%, 315% and 295% and expected
lives of three to six years. We have used the simplified method as provided by Staff Accounting
Bulletin 107, Share Based Payment, to estimate the expected life of stock options granted during
the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. This method allows us to estimate the
expected life using the average of the vesting period and the contractual life of the stock options
granted. As of June30, 2006, we had approximately $5,400,000 of unearned compensation related to nonvested
stock options, which we will record in our statement of operations over a weighted average
recognition period of less than two years. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2005, we adopted a Long-Term Incentive Compensation LTIC program to
replace our traditional equity based compensation program. Under the LTIC program, we grant a
smaller number of options and shares of restricted stock under the
2002 Plan. We do not treat shares of restricted stock as issued and outstanding
on our balance sheet until the restrictions lapse. Our disclosure of
vested shares includes shares which are never issued because they are withheld to fund employees
payroll taxes. We withheld 1,103shares under the LTIC program during
the year ended June30, 2006 to fund employees payroll
taxes. Our annual LTIC
grants occur in the first quarter of each fiscal year. The shares of restricted stock granted
under the LTIC program have a five-year vesting period with an accelerated vesting provision of
three years based on achievement of specific goals and objectives. We recorded an expense of
approximately $2,774,000 and $2,553,000 for the years ended June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
related to the vesting of restricted stock under the LTIC. In June2003, we made an offer the Tender Offer to certain of our employees to exchange options
with exercise prices greater than or equal to $4400 per share outstanding under our 1983 Incentive
Stock Option Plan, 1983 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan, 1993 Stock Option Plan, Third Amended and
Restated 1995 Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc. 1997 Stock Option Plan, BlueGill Technologies, Inc.
1998 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan, and 2002 Plan, for restricted stock units of
our common stock, and in certain cases, cash payments. Restricted stock units issued under the
Tender Offer vest ratably over a three-year period. The offer period closed on July17, 2003, and
employees holding 1,165,035 options participated in the Tender Offer. We made cash payments
totaling $586,000 in July2003 representing the cash consideration portion of the Tender Offer, and
we will issue approximately 153,000 shares of restricted stock under the 2002 Plan on or about July
17, 2006. We recorded an expense of $1,612,000, $2,112,000 and $2,994,000 for the years ended June
30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for cash payments made and the vesting of restricted stock
units. There was no financial impact to us for the year ended June30, 2003. On July19, 2004, we
issued 51,143 shares relating to the portion of the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2004. In
total, 80,588 shares actually vested, of which 29,445 shares were retained by us to fund the
employees payroll taxes associated with the vesting. On July19, 2005, we issued 42,756 shares
relating to the portion of the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2005. In total, 67,174 shares
actually vested, of which 24,418 shares were retained by us to fund the employees payroll taxes
associated with the vesting. On July17, 2006, we issued 38,998 shares relating to the portion of
the Tender Offer that vested on July17, 2006. In total, 62,239 shares actually vested, of which
23,241 shares were retained by us to fund the employees payroll taxes associated with the vesting. 91 Table of Contents Restricted Stock The following tables summarize the activity of restricted stock under our 2002 Plan, from July1,

As of June30, 2006, we had approximately $8,800,000 of nonvested restricted stock which we
will record in our statement of operations over a weighted average recognition period of about two
years. Associate Stock Purchase Plan Under our Associate Stock Purchase Plan, we are authorized to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of our
common stock to our full-time employees, nearly all of whom are eligible to participate. In
November2002, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of shares reserved and available
for sale under our Associate Stock Purchase Plan from 1,000,000 shares to 2,000,000 shares. Under
the terms of the Associate Stock Purchase Plan, our employees can choose, every six months, to have
up to 15% of their salary withheld to purchase our common stock. The purchase price of the stock
is 85% of the end-of-period market price. On June13, 2005, we amended our Associate Stock
Purchase Plan to remove a look-back feature which established the purchase price as 85% of the
lower of the beginning-of-period and end-of-period market price. Participation in the plan by
eligible employees has ranged from 25% to 50% in any given six-month period. Under the Associate
Stock Purchase Plan, we issued 53,066 shares in July2006, 54,390 in January2006, 67,204 shares in
July2005, 92,805 in January2005, 72,293 in July2004 and 74,952 in January2004 from our
employees salary withholdings from the respective previous six-month period. As of June30, 2006,
there are 670,389 shares available for future issuance to our employees under our Associate Stock
Purchase Plan. For the year ended June30, 2006, we recorded an expense of approximately $708,000
under the provisions of SFAS 123R for our Associate Stock Purchase Plan. 92 Table of Contents The following is a summary of the weighted average fair market value of the look-back feature in

In January1997, our board of directors approved an amendment to our 401k plan, which
authorized up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock to be used by us to match our employee
contributions to our 401k plan. Our board of directors authorized an additional 1,000,000 shares
of our common stock for the matching contribution in November2002. We issued 108,785 shares in
August2006, 82,242 shares in August2005 and 108,484 shares in August2004 to fund our 401k
match that had accrued during the years ended June30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. As of June30, 2006, there were 883,227 shares available for future contributions to our 401k plan. Stock Related Transactions With Third Parties - In October2000, we completed an agreement to
acquire various electronic billing and payment assets from Bank of America in exchange for
10,000,000 shares of our common stock, $35,000,000 in cash and warrants to acquire an additional
10,000,000 shares of our common stock. In connection with a December2003 modification of the terms
of our processing services agreement with Bank of America, the amount of shares available under the
warrants was reduced to 5,000,000. Bank of America has the ability to earn warrants for up to
5,000,000 shares, 3,000,000 of which vest upon achievement of specific levels of active subscriber
adoption of electronic billing and payment services and 2,000,000 of which vest upon achievement of
specific levels of electronic bills delivered, as defined. The warrants have a strike price of
$3250 and expire on September30, 2010. At the time that vesting of a portion of these warrants
becomes probable, we will record a charge for the fair value of the portion of the warrants earned
to date based on Bank of Americas progress towards achieving the milestones set forth in the
agreement. We will continue to record a charge each period for any additional portion of the
warrants earned, plus any change in fair value of the cumulative amount of warrants earned to date,
up to the point in time that the milestones are achieved and actual vesting occurs. Any charge
associated with these warrants will be recorded as a reduction of revenue up to the aggregate
amount of revenue received from Bank of America. No such charges have occurred through June30,
2006. In January1998, we entered into a ten-year processing agreement with a strategic partner. Under
the terms of the agreement, the partner acquired ten-year warrants exercisable at $20 15/16 for
10,000,000 shares of our common stock. 3,000,000 warrants vested upon the execution of a related
processing outsourcing agreement on March9, 1998. Warrants to acquire 1,500,000 shares of our
common stock remain outstanding at June30, 2006. NOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE The following table reconciles the differences in earnings per share and shares outstanding between

and 2004, also exclude the effect of approximately 239,000, 2,603,000 and 3,222,000 of
out-of-the-money options and warrants, respectively. 93 Table of Contents NOTE 15. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS Retirement Plan We have a defined contribution 401k retirement plan covering substantially all
of our U.S.-based employees. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute a portion of their
salary until retirement and we, at our discretion, may match a portion of our employees
contribution. In January2002, we added a similar plan covering substantially all our non
U.S.-based employees. Total expense under both of our plans amounted to $4,053,000, $3,040,000 and
$3,009,000 for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Pension Plan We have a defined contribution pension plan for our eligible United Kingdom
employees. Total contributions amounted to $797,000, $361,000 and $130,000 for the years ended June
30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan In January1999, we established a deferred compensation plan; the
DCP, covering our highly compensated employees as defined by the DCP. Under the plan, eligible
employees may contribute a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis. The DCP is a non-qualified
plan; therefore, the associated liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets as of
June30, 2006 and 2005. In addition, we have established a rabbi trust to finance our obligations
under the DCP with corporate-owned life insurance policies on participants. The cash surrender
value of such policies is also included in our consolidated balance sheets as of June30, 2006 and
2005. Total expense under the DCP for the years ended June30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted to
$74,000, $229,000 and $161,000, respectively. Group Medical Plans Effective January1, 2000, we converted all of our U.S.-based employees to a
group medical self-insurance plan. We have employed an administrator to manage this plan. Under
terms of this plan, both we and eligible employees are required to make contributions. The
administrator reviews all claims filed and authorizes the payment of benefits. We have stop-loss
insurance coverage on all individual claims exceeding $300,000. Prior to January1, 2000, we had a
group medical self-insurance plan covering certain of our employees, and medical insurance coverage
under managed care health plans covering the remaining employees. We provide supplemental medical
insurance coverage to our non U.S.-based employees. Total expenses for medical insurance coverage
including premiums amounted to $17,224,000, $16,113,000 and $13,014,000 for the years ended June
30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Under the self-insurance plan, we expense amounts as claims
are incurred and liabilities are recorded for incurred but not reported claims. At June30, 2006
and 2005, we accrued $2,930,000 and $3,155,000, respectively, as a liability for costs incurred but
not paid under this plan. In December1998, we created CheckFree Management Corporation to administer our employee medical
benefits program. We owned a controlling interest in the subsidiary until June30, 2004 and,
therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our subsidiarys results of
operations until that date. On June30, 2004, we legally merged CheckFree Management Corporation
into CheckFree Services Corporation. NOTE 16. REORGANIZATION CHARGES Reorganization of fiscal year 2005 On June16, 2005, we terminated the employment of
approximately 200 associates, re-scoping many positions with the intent to re-hire as quickly as
possible, and the elimination of some others. As part of the action, we moved our Electronic
Billing and Payment operations at our Waterloo, Ontario, Canada facility to our headquarters in
Norcross, Georgia. A summary of our reorganization charge recorded by us during our fiscal year ended June30, 2005 by
reportable segment is as follows in thousands

NOTE 17. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the variability associated with
the interest rate sensitive portion of our processing and servicing revenue, specifically, to
effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our interest rate sensitive revenue. At
inception, we formally designate and document our swaps as cash flow hedges of the variability in
interest rate sensitive revenue and state the risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking the hedge transaction. We formally assess, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the swap is highly effective
in offsetting changes in the cash flows of our underlying interest rate sensitive revenue. The
critical terms of the interest rate swap and the hedged interest rate sensitive revenue are the
same. Accordingly, there is no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate swaps. Pursuant to
SFAS 133, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps are
recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component
of stockholders equity of our consolidated balance sheet. Any ineffectiveness of the cash flow
hedge would be reclassified to processing and servicing revenue as earnings are affected by the
cash flow variability of the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue. On April23, 2004, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements. We also entered into two
separate interest swap agreements on July23 and November5, 2004. Each swap agreement has a
notional amount of $25,000,000. As of June30, 2006 we had $75,000,000 of notional amounts
outstanding. All of our swap agreements expired on July31, 2006. Changes in fair value of the net liability of approximately $167,000 and $1,500,000 as of June30,
2006 and 2005, respectively, related to our cash flow hedges included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss as of June30, 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows after-tax, in

We expect that approximately $107,000 of the ending balance of deferred net losses associated with
cash flow hedges will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income lossto
processing and servicing revenues during the next three months. We expect that the amount
reclassified will generally offset the anticipated change in earnings 95 Table of Contents relating to the variability
of the cash flows of the underlying interest rate sensitive revenue. The maximum length of time
over which we are hedging, at the inception of each notional swap agreement, is four years,
although the average
life of all outstanding interest swap agreements is one month as of June30, 2006. NOTE 18. INCOME TAXES Our income lossfrom continuing operations before income taxes consists of the following in

At June30, 2006, we had approximately $38,400,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards and
$1,200,000 of federal net operating loss carryforwards available, expiring in 2006 to 2024 and 2022
to 2024, respectively. We have $2,200,000 of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available as
of June30, 2006. These losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Additionally, at June30,
2006, we had approximately $900,000 of state and $2,000,000 of foreign tax credit carryforwards
available, expiring in 2014 to 2016 and 2012 to 2014, respectively. The Internal Revenue Service
IRS has commenced an examination of our June30, 2004 and 2005 tax returns. The tax attributes of certain positions we have taken on our statutory tax filings are complex and
may be challenged by the taxing authorities. We entered into a strategic transaction in fiscal
year 1999 whereby we recorded a one time tax deduction of approximately $30,000,000 and additional
tax deductions of approximately $38,000,000 over the next five years. We believe that this
transaction was executed appropriately and in accordance with the prevailing tax law. Accordingly
such deductions will not be finalized until an examination of our tax returns has been completed.
The IRS examination currently in process may result in assessments of additional taxes that are
resolved either with the IRS or potentially through the courts. Therefore, we have provided a
reserve of approximately $9,600,000 and $9,200,000 for future resolution of our uncertain tax
matters, as of June30, 2006 and 2005, respectively. While we believe the tax reserve is adequate,
the ultimate resolution of these tax matters may exceed or be below the reserve. 97 Table of Contents The realization of our deferred tax assets, which relate primarily to our net operating loss
carryforwards and temporary differences, is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable
income in future periods. We intend to reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign
subsidiaries indefinitely, and hence no provision has been made relative to those undistributed
earnings. At each year end, we evaluate the recoverability of our tax assets. Based on our
evaluation of our expected future profitability and changes in certain states tax laws, we
determined that it is more likely than not that certain of our foreign research tax credits and
state net operating loss carryforwards would not be realized. Accordingly, we increased our foreign
research credit valuation allowance by $320,000 to $1,937,000, increased our valuation allowance
relating to our state net operating loss by $28,000 to $1,149,000, for the portion of our
carryforwards that may not be utilized by us prior to expiration as of June30, 2006, and
established a valuation allowance for foreign loss carryforwards of $262,000. NOTE 19. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION

A further description of each of our business segments along with the Corporate services area
follows   
Electronic Commerce Electronic Commerce provides services that
allow consumers to receive electronic bills through the Internet,
pay bills electronically including payments received by agents at
walk-in locations and payments made telephonically or in paper form to anyone and
perform ordinary banking transactions including balance inquiries,
transfers between accounts and on-line statement reconciliation.
These services are primarily directed to financial institutions,
internet financial sites, personal financial management software
providers and the customers of these businesses.   
Software Software includes software products and related
services for electronic billing, ACH processing and account
reconciliation. These products and services are primarily
directed to large corporations and financial institutions.   
Investment Services Investment Services includes investment
portfolio management services and investment trading and reporting
services. These products and services are primarily directed to
fee-based money managers and financial planners who manage
investments of institutions and high net worth individuals.   
Corporate Corporate services include human resources, legal,
finance and accounting and various other of our unallocated
overhead charges. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies. We evaluate performance based on revenues and operating income
lossof our respective segments. Segment operating income lossexcludes acquisition-related
intangible asset amortization, the impact of discontinued operations, the SFAS 123R equity-based
compensation expense related to stock options granted before the implementation of our current
incentive compensation philosophy beginning July1, 2004, which significantly 98 Table of Contents reduces overall
participation and focuses on restricted stock awards with limited stock option grants,
reorganization
charges, the write-off of capitalized software, and in-process research and development costs.
Inter-segment sales are insignificant and are eliminated in consolidation. The following sets forth certain financial information attributable to our business segments for

Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management, with the participation of
our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule13a-15 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. Based upon this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial
officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were 1designed to ensure that
material information relating to our company is accumulated and made known to our management,
including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, in a timely manner, particularly
during the period in which this report was being prepared and 2effective, in that they provide
reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or
submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Management believes, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and
operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control and instances of fraud,
if any, within a company have been detected. Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. With the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The scope of managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting includes all of our businesses except for PhoneCharge, Inc, a business acquired
on January1, 2006. PhoneCharge constituted 64% of total assets as of June30, 2006 and 25% of
