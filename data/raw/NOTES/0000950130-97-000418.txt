INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors of AK Steel Holding Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AK Steel
Holding Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31,
1995 and 1996, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation--AK Steel Holding Corporation AK Holding and its
wholly-owned subsidiary AK Steel Corporation AK Steel, collectively the
Company were formed effective March 29, 1994 as a result of the
recapitalization of Armco Steel Company, L.P. the Partnership. The
recapitalization occurred on April 7, 1994, effective as of March 29, 1994, in
a series of transactions collectively, the Recapitalization, pursuant to
which i Armco Inc. Armco and a subsidiary of Kawasaki Steel Corporation
Kawasaki, the limited partners of the Partnership and the owners of all of
the outstanding shares of AK Steel the general partner of the Partnership,
transferred to AK Holding solely in exchange for Common Stock of AK Holding
the Common Stock, all of the shares of AK Steel and their limited
partnership interests in the Partnership, ii AK Holding transferred to AK
Steel the limited partnership interests in the partnership that it acquired
from Armco and the Kawasaki subsidiary and, thereupon, AK Steel as owner of
the entire equity interest in the Partnership, succeeded by operation of law
to the assets and business of the Partnership, iii AK Holding consummated a
public offering of $4584 of its Common Stock and AK Steel consummated a
public offering of $3250 principal amount of its 10 3/4% Senior Notes Due
2004 the Senior Notes, iv proceeds from the public offerings of the
Common Stock and Senior Notes were applied to repay $6195 of indebtedness of
the Company, to fund a $1000 contribution to the Company pension trust with
the remaining $639 used for expenses, fees, and general corporate purposes,
and v AK Holding issued to an affiliate of Kawasaki additional shares of
Common Stock in exchange for a $1000 subordinated note of the Company
previously held by that affiliate.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires the use of management estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The results of operations and financial position of AK Steel approximates
the results of operations and financial position of AK Holding.
For comparison purposes certain 1994 and 1995 items have been reclassified
to conform with 1996 classifications.
The Company consists of the operations and accounts of the Middletown Works,
Ashland Works, Headquarters, AKSR Investments Inc. AKR and AKS
Investments, Inc. and its group of wholly-owned subsidiaries, the AKSII
Group. Effective December 31, 1996, AKR, formerly a Delaware Corporation,
was reorganized as an Ohio limited liability company. The Company is an
integrated steel producer of carbon flat rolled steel for the automotive,
appliance, manufacturing and other markets. The Company has one major customer
that accounted for 22%, 20% and 17% of its net sales in 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively.
Employees--As of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately 5,800
active employees, of whom approximately 57% were represented by the Armco
Employees Independent Federation, Inc. the AEIF, 19% by the United
Steelworkers of America the USWA and 6% by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers Union the OCAW. The AEIF represents all hourly employees and
certain nonexempt salaried employees at the Middletown Works. The USWA
represents hourly steelmaking employees and certain nonexempt salaried
employees at the Ashland Works. The OCAW represents hourly employees at the
Ashland Works coke manufacturing facility. In 1994, the USWA sought to become
the collective bargaining representative of the hourly employees at the
Middletown Works, but a majority of those employees voted to retain the AEIF
as their representative. No assurance can be given that the USWA will not seek
to represent the Middletown Works' employees at some future date.
The Company agreement with the AEIF is effective through February 29,
2000. The agreement with OCAW expires October 1, 1997. The expiration date of
its agreement with the USWA is presently the subject of
19

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
dispute, with the Company asserting that the agreement is effective until
March 30, 2000 and the USWA asserting that the agreement will expire March 28,
1997. No prediction can be made as to whether or when this dispute will be
resolved or as to the possible consequences thereof.
Cash Equivalents--Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are of
an original maturity of three months or less.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--The carrying value of the Company
financial instruments does not differ materially from their estimated fair
value quoted market prices in 1995 and 1996 with the exception of the 10
3/4% Senior Notes, whose fair value approximates $3632 and $3542 at December
31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Accounts receivable--The allowance for doubtful accounts was $25 and $15
at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.
Inventories--Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost
of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in, first out LIFO
method. Other inventories are measured principally at average cost.

3330    3535
Other     77     74
Total   $3407    $3609
There was no liquidation of LIFO inventory layers in 1994, 1995 or 1996.
Investments--The Company has investments in associated companies joint
ventures and an entity that the Company does not control. These investments
are accounted for under the equity method. Because these companies are
directly integrated in the basic steelmaking facilities, the Company includes
its proportionate share of the income loss of these associated companies in
cost of products sold.
Through November, Virginia Horn Taconite Company Virginia Horn, a member
of the AKSII Group, owned a 56% equity interest in Eveleth Expansion Company
Eveleth, a partnership that produces iron ore pellets, which equates to a
35% interest in Eveleth Mines. The Company records its proportionate share of
the gains/losses of Eveleth in the Company cost of goods sold which were
$102, $02 and $54 in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively. In addition,
the Company had fully impaired its investment in Eveleth to recognize the
Company estimate of the net realizable value of the fixed assets of Eveleth.
In December 1996, under a restructuring of Eveleth Mines, Virginia Horn
increased its ownership interest in Eveleth Mines LLC Evtac, a newly
formed Minnesota limited liability company, to 40%. In connection with such
investment, Virginia Horn has certain commitments to Evtac. Because, under
Eveleth member control agreement, Virginia Horn does not control Evtac, the
investment is accounted for under the equity method.
Property, Plant and Equipment--Plant and equipment are depreciated under the
straight line method over their estimated lives ranging from 3 to 31 years.
Maintenance and repair expenses for 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $3256, $3229
and $3348 respectively.

2. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred Stock--In October 1994, the Company completed the public offering
of 7,479,674 shares of its Convertible Preferred Stock, Shared Appreciation
Income Linked Securities the SAILS which constitute a series of the
Company Preferred Stock and rank prior to the Common Stock as to payment of
dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation.
The SAILS earn dividends at a rate of 7% per annum of the stated value of
$3075 per share. The dividends are cumulative from the date of original
issuance on October 15, 1994, and are payable quarterly in arrears.
The shares of SAILS are convertible into shares of Common Stock at the
option of the holder at any time prior to the mandatory conversion date of
October 15, 1998, and, unless previously redeemed, are convertible into 8621
of a share of Common Stock, equivalent to a conversion price of $3567 per
share of Common Stock, subject to adjustment upon certain events.
On the mandatory conversion date, unless previously redeemed or converted,
each of the shares of SAILS will convert into one share of Common Stock and,
at the option of the Company, the right to receive cash or Common Stock based
on current market price equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends.
At any time on or after October 16, 1997 until immediately prior to the
mandatory conversion date, the Company may redeem any or all of the
outstanding SAILS.
The holders of the SAILS will not have voting rights except as required by
law and except as follows: i in the event that dividends on the SAILS or any
other series of Preferred Stock with like voting rights are in arrears and
unpaid for six quarterly dividend periods, and in certain other circumstances,
the holders of SAILS voting separately as a class with holders of all other
series of outstanding Preferred Stock with like voting rights will be
entitled to vote, on the basis of one vote for each of the SAILS, for the
election of two directors of the Company, such directors to be in addition to
the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors immediately prior
to the accrual of such right, and ii the holders of the SAILS will have
voting rights with respect to certain alterations of the Company Certificate
of Incorporation and certain other matters, voting on the same basis or
separately as a series.
Common Stock--In April 1994, the Company consummated a public offering of
its $01 par value Common Stock. The holders of Common Stock will be entitled
to receive dividends when and as dividends are declared by the Board of
Directors out of funds legally available. The holders of Common Stock are
entitled to one vote per share and are not entitled to preemptive or
subscription rights.
Dividends--The Company has paid quarterly dividends on its Common Stock
since November 15, 1995. Dividends at the rate of $015 per share were paid on
February 15, May 15, and August 15, 1996 and a dividend of $020 per share was
paid on November 15, 1996. The Company has paid and intends to continue to pay
dividends on the SAILS in accordance with the terms thereof. The declaration
and payment of cash dividends is subject to restrictions imposed by the
instruments governing its senior debt. At December 31, 1996, the Company had
adequate amounts available for the payment of cash dividends.
Stock Repurchase Plans--On October 9, 1995, the Board of Directors approved
a plan to repurchase from time to time up to $1000 of its outstanding equity
securities. As of December 31, 1995, the Company had repurchased 637,435
shares of Common Stock for $215, an average of $3362 per share to be held as
treasury stock at cost. In addition, the Company purchased and retired
1,563,700 shares of the SAILS for $523 at an average of $3343 per share in
1995 and 707,600 shares of the SAILS for $263 at an average of $3716 per
share in 1996, which completed the program.
21

On May 15, 1996, the Board of Directors approved a plan to repurchase from
time to time up to $1000 of its outstanding equity securities. As of December
31, 1996, the Company had repurchased and retired 362,600 shares of the SAILS
for $128, an average of $3536 per share under that plan.
Shareholder Rights Plan--On January 23, 1996, the Board of Directors adopted
a Shareholder Rights Plan pursuant to which the Board declared a dividend of
one Preferred Share Purchase Right collectively, the Rights for each share
of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on February 5, 1996. The
Rights are generally not exercisable until 10 days after any person or group
of affiliated or associated persons acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the Company voting stock or announces a tender offer that could
result in the acquisition of 30% or more of such voting stock. Each Right,
should it become exercisable, will entitle the holder to buy 1/100th of a
share of a new series of the Company Preferred Stock, designated as Series A
Junior Preferred Stock the Preferred Stock, at an exercise price of $130.
Unless the Rights are sooner redeemed, if any person or group of affiliated
or associated persons, with certain exceptions, becomes the beneficial owner
of 20% or more of the Company voting stock other than pursuant to a tender
offer or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock that is approved by the Board of Directors with the approval of the
Continuing Directors as defined in the Rights Plan after taking into account
the long term value of the Company and all other factors they consider
relevant, each Right not owned by the acquirer would become exercisable for a
fraction of a share of the Company Preferred Stock having a market value
equal to two times the exercise price of the Right.
In addition, unless the Rights are sooner redeemed or the transaction is
approved by the Board of Directors and the Continuing Directors, if the
Company were to be acquired in a merger or other business combination in
which any share of the Company Common Stock are changed into or exchanged
for other securities or assets, or if more than 50% of the Company assets
or earning power were to be sold in one or a series of related transactions,
the holders of the Rights would be entitled, after the Rights become
exercisable, to buy, for each Right, such number of shares of Common Stock of
the acquiring company as have a market value equal to two times the exercise
price of the Right.
The Rights are redeemable, in whole but not in part, at the option of the
Board of Directors with the approval of a majority of the Continuing
Directors, at any time prior to the earlier of i the close of business on
the tenth day after a public announcement of an acquisition of beneficial
ownership of 20% or more of the Company voting stock by any person or group
of affiliated or associated persons or at such later date as may be
authorized by the Board of Directors and a majority of the Continuing
Directors or ii at any time prior to January 23, 2006, their final
expiration date.
Common Stock Options--On January 13, 1994, the stockholders of the Company
approved the AK Steel Holding Corporation 1994 Stock Incentive Plan the
SIP. The SIP, which is administered by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors, permits the granting of Nonqualified Stock Options and
Restricted Stock to directors and to executive and key management employees of
the Company. This plan was amended by the Board of Directors on January 18,
1996 with approval by the stockholders on May 15, 1996. Under the original
SIP, 2,300,000 shares were reserved for issuance of which 1,916,667 shares
were reserved for stock options and 383,333 were reserved for restricted stock
awards. Under this plan as amended, the maximum number of shares reserved was
increased to 3,900,000 and the imposition of separate maximum limitations on
the number of shares available for grant of stock options and restricted stock
was eliminated. The exercise price of each option equals the market price of
the Company Common Stock on the date of the grant. Both the restricted stock
awards and the stock options have a maximum term of 10 years and may not be
exercised earlier than six months following the date of grant or such other
term as may be specified in the award agreement. Generally, twenty-five
percent of the shares of restricted stock awarded shall vest two years after
the grant date

DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS
and an additional twenty-five percent shall vest on the third, fourth and
fifth anniversaries of the grant date. The nonqualified stock options vest
thirty three percent per year over three years.
The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for
this plan. The compensation cost that has been charged against income for the
restricted stock awards issued under the plan was $09 for 1995 and $32 for
1996. The Company has adopted the pro forma disclosure requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, in the fourth quarter of 1996. Had compensation
cost for the Company SIP been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates for awards under the plan consistent with the method of SFAS No.
123, the Company net income and earnings per share for 1995 and 1996 would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:
1995  1996
Net income  As reported $2686 $1459
Pro forma  $2682 $1441
Primary earnings per share. As reported $ 956 $ 507
Pro forma  $ 954 $ 501
Fully diluted earnings per share. As reported $ 814 $ 470
Pro forma  $ 814 $ 464
The fair value of the options is estimated on the grant date using a Black-
Scholes option pricing model considering the $80 per share annual dividend
beginning the fourth quarter of 1996 and the prior annual dividend of $60 per
share along with the following weighted average assumptions:

Earnings Per Common Share--The computation of earnings per common share and
common equivalent shares is based upon the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding plus in periods in which they have a dilutive effect
common share equivalents from stock options using the treasury stock method.
Net income was reduced for preferred dividends. The fully diluted per share
computation assumes conversion of the SAILS into Common Stock using the if-
converted method and that the stock is outstanding the full year. The weighted
average number of common shares and common equivalent shares used to compute
earnings per share is:

Temporary differences represent the cumulative taxable or deductible amounts
recorded in the consolidated financial statements in different years than
recognized in the tax returns. The postretirement benefit difference includes
amounts expensed in the consolidated financial statements for health care,
life insurance and other postretirement benefits which become deductible in
the tax return upon payment or funding in qualified trusts. Other temporary
differences represent principally various expenses accrued for financial
reporting purposes which are not deductible for tax reporting purposes until
paid. The depreciable assets temporary difference represents generally tax
depreciation in excess of financial statement depreciation. The inventory
difference relates primarily to differences in the LIFO reserve, reduced by
tax overhead capitalized in excess of book amounts. At December 31, 1995, the
Company had a regular tax net operating loss NOL carryforward of $964 and
an alternative minimum tax AMT loss carryforward of $282 generated in
1994. At December 31, 1996, the regular tax NOL carryover remaining was $772
and the AMT carryover was zero. This loss will expire in 2009 if not used by
then.
Significant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:

On December 1, 1994, the Company entered into a Receivables Purchase
Agreement with AKR. On the same date, AKR entered into a Receivables Purchase
and Servicing Agreement the Purchase Agreement with a group of six banks.
Under the Purchase Agreement, the total commitment of the banks is $1250,
including up to $400 in letters of credit. The Company sold substantially all
of its accounts receivable to AKR and will sell additional receivables to AKR
as they are generated. AKR will fund its purchase of receivables from cash
collections on the purchased receivables and proceeds from selling interests
in the receivables to the participating banks. The banks' commitments expire
on December 1, 2000. The Company acts as servicer of the receivables sold and
will make billings and collections in the ordinary course of business.
As of December 31, 1996, no funded interest was sold to the participating
banks, although $56 in letters of credit had been issued. At December 31,
1996, AKR had a sufficient pool of eligible receivables that could be sold to
utilize the available capacity of the participating banks' commitments.
At December 31, 1995 and 1996, the Company long-term debt, less current

6. EMPLOYEE AND RETIREE BENEFIT PLANS
Pension Plans--The Company provides noncontributory pension benefits to all
employees. Benefits are based on the highest of several calculations including
years of service and earnings in the highest 60 consecutive months in the last
120 months prior to retirement, a minimum amount per year of service, or a
combination of both. The qualified plans are funded in accordance with the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended, with additional amounts contributed at the Company
discretion. The Company pension contributions for 1995 and 1996 were $930
and $250, respectively.

Retiree Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits--In addition to providing
pension benefits, the Company provides certain health and life insurance
benefits for retirees. Most employees become eligible for these benefits at
retirement. For 1994, 1995 and 1996, claims paid for retiree health and life
insurance benefits amounted to $348, $362 and $374, respectively.
The Company records health care costs per SFAS No. 106, Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, which requires
accrual of retiree medical and life insurance benefits as these benefits are
earned rather than recognition of these costs as claims are paid. In 1994,
1995 and 1996 the excess of total postretirement benefit expense recorded
under SFAS No. 106 over the Company former method of accounting for these
benefits was $162, $212 and $21, respectively.
Effective June 30, 1995, the Company established a Welfare Benefit Master
Plan and Trust the Trust for the purpose of paying medical and life
insurance benefits to employees of the Company, retired former employees and
their eligible dependents. Effective January 1, 1996, the Company began paying
benefits from the Trust; however, the Company has continued to reimburse the
Trust for these payments. The Company may continue to reimburse the Trust for
these payments at its discretion, although no funding obligation exists.
The Company has announced changes in the retiree medical coverage for the
non-represented salary group effective December 31, 1996. The Company
portion of the health insurance premium for post 1983 salaried retirees will
be capped at 1996 levels. This change will apply to all current and future
retirees. In addition, for post 1996 retirees in this group only, the Company
provided health benefit will be reduced by six percent for each year of
retirement prior to age 62. These changes reduced the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation for the Company at January 1, 1996 by
approximately $450 and the related annual expense for 1996 by approximately
$70.
The following sets forth the plans' funded status, reconciled with amounts
recognized in the Company Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1995
and 1996.

For measurement purposes, health care costs are assumed to increase 750% in
1997 grading down by 100% yearly to a constant level of 500% annual increase
for pre-65 benefits and 500% in 1997 with a constant rate of 500% for post-
65 benefits. In concluding that health care trend rates will decrease at a
rate of 100% per year, the Company has considered future rates of inflation,
recent movements toward managed health care programs in negotiated contracts
and the trend among larger companies toward the formation of coalitions in an
effort to reduce health care costs. The Company has finalized negotiations
with health care providers in the Cincinnati-Dayton corridor and has
implemented a managed care program for the Ashland location. The Company is
also evaluating Medicare risk contracts for its retired employees. A one 1
percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each
year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
January 1, 1997 by $613 and the aggregate of the service cost and interest
cost components of net period benefit cost for the year then ended by $55.
The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 725% and 800% for 1995 and 1996,
respectively.
7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On May 4, 1995, Armco Inc. Armco announced it had completed the sale of
1,023,987 shares of the Company Common Stock. With the completion of the
sale, Armco no longer owns any of the Company stock. Sales to Armco and its
affiliates amounted to $531 and $322 during 1994 and 1995, respectively. In
addition, the Company charged Armco approximately $149 and $188 during 1994
and 1995 for its rolling services. The Company purchased stainless material in
the amount of $301 and $512 in 1994 and 1995, respectively.
The Company sold its interest in Southwestern Ohio Steel L.P. SOS on
December 30, 1994. In 1994, the Company sales to SOS were $1102 and the
Company purchased processing services and other material of $37.
In the ordinary course of business, National Material Limited Partnership,
of which Cyrus Tang, a director of the Company, is President and Chief
Executive Officer, sells scrap to, and purchases steel from, the Company.
During 1994, 1995 and 1996 sales amounted to $54, $203 and $218 and
purchases amounted to $03, $04 and $06 respectively.
8. COMMITMENTS
The principal raw materials and commodities required in the Company
manufacturing operations are coal, iron ore, electricity, natural gas, oxygen,
scrap metal, limestone and other commodity materials, all of which are
purchased at competitive or prevailing market prices. Adequate sources of
supply exist for all of the Company raw material requirements.
At December 31, 1996, commitments for future capital investments, excluding
Rockport Works but including those made to assure environmental compliance,
totalled approximately $410, all of which will be funded in 1997. In
addition, at December 31, 1996, the Company had outstanding commitments for
the constructing and equipping of Rockport Works under contracts aggregating
$4209; however, the Company maximum aggregate liability in the event of
cancellation of these contracts is limited to $339.
9. SPECIAL CHARGES AND UNUSUAL ITEMS
On December 30, 1994, the Company sold its 50% equity interest in SOS and
4915% equity interest in Nova Steel Processing to its former joint venture
partner in the two companies, Itochu Corporation, for $430. The sale resulted
in a gain of $159 which is included in Special charges and unusual items in
the Consolidated Statements of Income for the period ended December 31, 1994.

10. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM
In connection with the Recapitalization, during the second quarter of 1994
the Company repaid a total of $6195 of long-term debt. This early repayment
resulted in an extraordinary loss of $149.
11. LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND CONTINGENCIES
Domestic steel producers, including the Company, are subject to stringent
federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of
human health and the environment.
The Company has expended the following for environmental related capital
investments and environmental compliance:
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1994   1995   1996
IN MILLIONS
Environmental related capital investments. $  267 $  191 $  61
Environmental compliance costs.   464   517   536
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 the Amendments imposed new
standards designed to reduce air emissions. The Amendments have directly
affected many of the Company operations, particularly its coke oven
batteries. As of December 31, 1996, the Company has incurred $673 in capital
investments to bring its coke operations into compliance with the Amendments'
requirements. The Company does not expect capital investments for compliance
with these requirements to be material in the near future.
In addition to the items discussed below, the Company is also involved in
routine litigation, environmental proceedings, and claims pending with respect
to matters arising out of the normal conduct of the business. In management
opinion, the ultimate liability resulting from all claims, individually or in
the aggregate, will not materially affect the Company consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
As a result of a 1991 inspection of the Ashland Works' cokemaking operations
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA and the Kentucky
Department of Environmental Protection alleging mishandling of certain
regulated materials, the Company has entered into non-binding mediation with
the Kentucky Cabinet for Natural Resources.
Federal regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act impose
categorical pretreatment limits on the concentrations of various constituents
in coke plant wastewaters prior to discharge into publicly owned treatment
works POTW. Due to concentrations of ammonia and phenol in excess of these
limits at the Middletown Works, the Company, through the Middletown POTW,
petitioned the EPA for removal credits, a type of compliance exemption,
based on the Middletown POTW satisfactory treatment of the Company
wastewater for ammonia and phenol. The EPA declined to review the Company
application on the grounds that it had not yet promulgated new sludge
management rules. The Company thereupon sought and obtained from the Federal
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio an injunction prohibiting the
EPA from instituting enforcement action against the Company for noncompliance
with the pretreatment limitations, pending the EPA promulgation of the
applicable sludge management regulations. Although the Company is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter, if the EPA eventually refuses to grant the
Company request for removal credits, the Company could incur additional
costs to construct pretreatment facilities at the Middletown Works.
In January 1996, an action was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler
County, Ohio on behalf of four named plaintiffs who purport to represent a
class of plaintiffs consisting of all hourly employees at the
30
AK STEEL HOLDING CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--CONTINUED

Company Middletown Works and all hourly employees of independent contractors
working at the facility since June 1992. The complaint has twice been amended
to add three additional plaintiffs. The plaintiffs allege negligence and
intentional tort and seek compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified
amount for alleged dangerous working conditions at the Company Middletown
Works. In April 1996, plaintiffs moved to certify a class action. The Company
