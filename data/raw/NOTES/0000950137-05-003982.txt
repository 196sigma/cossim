Controls and Procedures Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of the financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. This process includes
those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our
assets; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of our management and
directors; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal control over
financial reporting to future periods are subject to risk that
the internal control may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or
procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004. In making this assessment, it used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSOin Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we have
concluded that, as of December31, 2004, our internal
control over financial reporting was effective based on those
criteria. 32 Table of Contents PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm has audited our assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, as stated in their report which appears
herein. Disclosure controls and procedures We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report, pursuant to
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of
the period covered by this report, were effective in timely
alerting them to material information relating to us required to
be included in our periodic SEC filings. Changes in internal control over financial reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
