35 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT The Board of Directors Carrier Access Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Carrier Access Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity and
comprehensive income loss and cash flows for each of the years
in the three year period ended December31, 2003. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of
Carrier Access Corporations management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Carrier Access Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. As discussed in Note5 to the consolidated
financial statements, Carrier Access Corporation adopted the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
effective January1, 2002. KPMG LLP Boulder, Colorado March12, 2004 36 Table of Contents CARRIER ACCESS CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS

STATEMENTS December31, 2001, 2002, and
2003 1.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies a.Business and Basis of
Presentation. Carrier Access Corporation the
Company is a provider of broadband digital access
equipment to communications service providers, including
incumbent local exchange carriers, wireless service providers,
competitive local exchange carriers,InterExchange Carriers
IXCs,IOCs,ISPs and wireless service
providers, which is used for the provisioning of enhanced voice
and high-speed Internet services by service providers to
end-users such as small and medium-sized businesses and
government and educational institutions. The Company sells its
products through distributors and directly to end-user
customers. The Company operates in one business segment and
substantially all of its sales and operations are domestic. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting standards generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. b.Cash and Cash Equivalents and
Marketable Securities Available for Sale. Cash and cash
equivalents include investments in highly liquid debt securities
with maturities or interest reset dates of three months or less
at the time of purchase. Marketable securities
available-for-sale represent U.S.Government
agency and corporate bonds with maturities of greater than three
months and are recorded at fair value. Marketable securities
available for sale all of which mature within one
year, consisted of the following as of December31 in
thousands, except percentages

Increases and temporary decreases in the fair
value of investments classified as available-for-sale are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, net
of the related tax effect, if any. Other than temporary declines
are recognized currently in the statement of operations.
Subsequent recoveries in the fair value, if any, are not
recognized in the statement of operations, but as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss, as indicated
above. c.Accounts receivable In general the
Company extends credit to customers, after completing an
evaluation of the customers credit worthiness. The Company
records a provision for uncollectible accounts receivables based
on managements review of the aging of the receivable
balances, and evaluation of the customers current ability
to pay, and current market conditions. d.Other receivables. Other
receivables consist of amounts owed from third party
manufacturers for components delivered from the Company for
their manufacture into finished products. 41 Table of Contents e.Fair Value of Financial
Instruments. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities are recorded at
cost which approximates fair value because of the short-term
maturity of these instruments. f.Inventory. Inventory is recorded
at the lower of cost or net realizable value using standard
costs that approximate average costs. Costs include certain
warehousing costs and other allocable overhead. The carrying
amount of inventory is marked down when 1the cost of the
inventory exceeds the estimated net realizable value determined
by analyzing assumptions about future demand and market
conditions or 2the technology associated with a product
is considered obsolete and the inventory cannot be used in the
manufacture of other products. g.Property and Equipment. Property,
equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and
are depreciated and amortized using the straight-line method
over useful lives ranging from three to thirty years or the
lease term. Depreciation and amortization expense for the years
ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 totaled
$48million, $21million, and $38million,
respectively. h.Goodwill and Other Intangibles.
Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFASNo142,
Goodwill and Other Intangibles. Intangible assets that
are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but
not those acquired in a business combination are initially
recorded and measured at their fair value. Costs of internal
developing, maintaining, or restoring intangible assets that are
not specifically identifiable, that have indeterminate lives, or
that are inherent in a continuing business and related to an
entity as a whole, are expensed as incurred. Intangible assets
with definite useful lives are amortized over such useful lives,
which range from three to five years, and are subject to tests
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that impairment may exist. Acquired goodwill and
certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, if any,
are not amortized. Instead goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets are subject to periodic at least annual
tests for impairment. For the periods presented the Company does
not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than
goodwill. Impairment testing is performed in two steps:
iThe Company assesses goodwill for a potential
impairment loss by comparing the fair value of its reporting
unit with its carrying value, and iiif an impairment is
indicated because the reporting units fair value is less
than its carrying amount, the Company measures the amount of
impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill
with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The Company has
determined that it has one reporting unit and therefore, the
Companys annual impairment tests for goodwill are
performed at the consolidated level. As a result of its
assessment in 2002, the company recorded impairments of goodwill
and other intangibles of $90million in 2002. The Company
also recorded a $42million impairment of its goodwill in
2001 in accordance with, the then applicable accounting
standards. i.Long-Lived Assets. The Company
monitors assets to be held and used for indications of
impairment. If indicated, the Company evaluates the carrying
value of the asset and records an impairment if and when the
carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from
future estimated cash flows and exceeds its fair value. An asset
that is classified as held-for-sale is recorded at the lower of
its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In connection with the restructuring in the
fourth quarter of 2002, the Company recorded an $800,000
impairment for certain capitalized assets that were either
abandoned or are no longer in use and held for sale. No
impairments of long-lived assets were recorded in 2003 or 2001. j.Revenue Recognition. Revenue from
sales of products is recognized upon shipment based upon the
Companys shipping terms, provided the Company has evidence
of an arrangement, the fee is fixed and collectibility is
probable. The Company provides limited price protection to
its distributors, whereby increases in prices are subject to a
60-day notice period before becoming effective. In addition, the
distributor is entitled to receive a credit for subsequent price
decreases to the extent of unsold distributor inventory at the
time of the price decrease. The Company also provides its
distributors with limited stock rotation rights, whereby
products may be returned for an equal dollar amount of new or
different equipment. Customers are limited to three exchanges
per year and an amount equal to 15% of purchases in the
preceding four-month period. Neither of these rights affect the
total sales price or payment obligations of the customer. In
addition, the customers obligation to the Company is not 42 Table of Contents contingent upon the ultimate resale of the
products. The Company provides for the estimated impact of
returns, price protection and stock rotation rights in its
allowance for estimated returns based on historical experience
and managements forecasts of price protection credits and
returns. k.Research and Development Costs.
Research and development costs are charged to operations as
incurred, and consist primarily of internal personnel and
facility costs. l.Income Taxes. Current income tax
expense benefit represents actual or estimated amounts payable
or receivable on tax return filings each year. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax
effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance
sheets, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The
change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period
measures the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period.
Effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets
and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to the tax
provision or benefit in the period of enactment. A valuation
allowance is required to reduce deferred tax assets if
management cannot conclude that realization of such assets is
more likely than not, as defined by SFASNo109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. In determining the need for
a valuation allowance, the Company considers its historical
taxable income, the expected reversal of temporary differences
and projections of future taxable income. m.Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings
per share EPS is computed by dividing income or
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted EPS reflects basic EPS adjusted for
the potential dilution, computed using the treasury stock
method, that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted and resulted in
the issuance of common stock. A reconciliation of net income loss and
weighted average shares used in computing basic and diluted
earnings loss per share amounts is presented below.

As a result of the Companys net losses for
the years ended December31, 2001 and 2002, all potential
dilutive securities were anti-dilutive and therefore have been
excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. The
number of shares excluded from computation of diluted net loss
per share because their effect is anti-dilutive totaled
2,996,580 for 2001, 3,589,395 for 2002, and 1,459,107 for 2003. n.Stock-Based Compensation. In
December 2002, the FASB issued SFASNo148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
Transition and Disclosure an amendment of
FASB Statement No123. This Statement provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, this Statement amends the disclosure
requirements of Statement 43 Table of Contents 123 to require prominent disclosures in both
annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect
of the method used on reported results. The following table summarizes relevant
information as to reported results under our intrinsic value
method of accounting for stock awards, with supplemental
information as if the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation
had been applied to each of the years in the three-year

The weighted average fair values of options
granted during 2001, 2002 and 2003 were $576, $194 and
$413per share, respectively, using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: no expected
dividends, 106% volatility in 2001, 316% volatility in 2002 and
111% volatility in 2003, expected life of the options of five
years in 2001, 2002 and 2003 and a risk-free interest rate of
38% for 2001, 30% for 2002 and 31% for 2003. o.Warranty Costs. The Company
provides warranties of various lengths to customers depending on
the specific product and the terms of the customer purchase
agreements. The Company has accrued for its warranty obligations
based on historical experience and managements estimate of
future warranty costs to be incurred. Charges and accruals to
the warrant liability are summarized as follows

adjusted for the change in net unrealized holding gains or
losses on available for sale securities. q.Reclassifications. Certain
reclassifications have been made in the 2001 and 2002 financial
statements to conform to the 2003 presentation. r.Exit and Disposal Activities. In
June 2002, FASB issued SFASNo. 146, Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.
SFASNo. 146 supercedes EITF94-3. Under
EITF94-3, a liability for an exit cost, as defined, was
recognized at the date of an entitys commitment to an exit
plan. SFASNo146 eliminates the definition and
requirements for recognition of exit costs in EITF94-3,
and concludes that an entitys commitment to a plan, by
itself, does not create a present obligation to others that
meets the definition of a liability. SFASNo146
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or
disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred.
SFASNo146 also establishes that fair value is the
objective for initial 44 Table of Contents measurement of the liability. The Company is
required to apply the provisions of SFASNo146 to
exit or disposal activities that are initiated after
December31, 2002. In December 2002, the Company completed a
restructuring plan in accordance with EITF94-3 designed to
reduce its expenses to be more in line with anticipated revenue.
Included in this plan were reductions in salary-related
expenses, facility closures or downsizing, and disposal of
excess or unused assets. As a result of these expense
reductions, the Company took a charge in the fourth quarter of
2002 of $20million. The charge will result in an
aggregate $20million cash outlay. The Company paid
approximately $400,000 of this charge in the fourth quarter of
2002 and approximately $418,000 in the first quarter of 2003,
including $264,000 for severance expenses related to the
elimination of 35 positions during the first quarter of 2003.
During the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2003, the
Company paid out an additional $217,000, $219,000, and $196,000
respectively in connection with the restructuring plan. The
majority of the remaining cash disbursements related to the
restructuring plan will be paid by December31, 2004. The
Company made no changes to its restructuring plan assumptions
during 2003. Restructuring reserve activity resulting from the
2002 fourth quarter restructuring plan for 2003 is detailed

2.Acquisitions On November25, 2003 Carrier Access
Corporation completed its acquisition of Paragon Networks
International,Inc Paragon. Management believes
the addition of Paragons products complements the
Companys own product portfolio by increasing the breadth
of its product offerings, as well as adding new customers. The
Company believes the acquisition will strengthen its position in
the wireless market and provide for synergies in revenue and
operating expenses. In exchange for all outstanding shares of
Paragon capital stock, Carrier issued 1,334,521shares of
Carrier Access common stock and $411,000 in cash to Paragon
stockholders. All outstanding Paragon options and warrants were
cancelled as part of the transaction. Carrier Access accounted
for the transaction using the purchase method of accounting. The
results of Paragons operations have been included in the
consolidated financial statements since November25, 2003. The aggregate purchase price was approximately
$206million, consisting of cash and Carrier Access common
stock issued, valued using the average closing price as of
November25, 2003 and the two days before and after, and
other costs directly related to the acquisition as follows in

In connection with the acquisition, the Company
acquired approximately $63million of net deferred tax
assets, comprised of deferred tax assets related primarily to
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax
liabilities related to the intangible assets acquired. In addition, the Company paid approximately
$10million to the employees of Paragon. Of this
approximately $670,000 was capitalized as part of the
acquisition cost as it required no future performance, while
approximately $330,000 related to retention bonuses which were
expensed in 2003 as the service obligations were completed. The
Company also incurred approximately $350,000 of direct
acquisition costs. The amount allocated to developed product
technology, backlog and customer relationships were determined
by an independent appraisal using established valuation
techniques in the high-technology communications industry. The goodwill acquired in connection with the
acquisition is not subject to amortization. Instead, it will be
subject to periodic at least annual tests for impairment see
note1h. The acquired intangible assets with definite
lives are subject to tests for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist, and
are being amortized over their useful lives as follows

Other Intangibles Effective January1, 2002, the Company
adopted SFASNo142. During the third quarter of
2002, the Companys analysis of implied goodwill versus
expected revenue and market value showed that the carrying value
of goodwill exceeded its fair value due to reduced revenue and
cash flow forecasts. As a result, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $9million against its goodwill. Had the Company applied the provisions of
SFASNo142 to all periods presented, net income
loss and earnings loss per share would have been as follows

The Company acquired $63million of net
deferred tax assets in connection with the acquisition of
Paragon including $91million related to net operating
loss carryforwards and $30million of deferred tax
liabilities associated with acquired intangible assets. Due to
the uncertainty regarding the realization of these net deferred
tax assets at the acquisition date, the Company recorded a
valuation allowance against the entire amount. The Company incurred a $355million net
operating loss for the period ending December31, 2002. A
portion of this operating loss was carried back to obtain a
refund of prior tax paid. Accordingly, the Company received an
income tax refund of approximately $70million in 2003.
The Company has approximately $383million of remaining
net operating losses from the current and prior years for
Federal tax purposes. Of this, $241million is from the
Paragon acquisition, and $142million is related to
Carrier Access operations. With respect to the net operating
loss carryforwards from Paragon, $37million may be used
to offset consolidated taxable income in 2004. The remaining
$204million is restricted to $14million per year
by section382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The
$142million of net operating loss carryforwards related
to Carrier Access operations has no limitations as to its annual
usage. 49 Table of Contents Net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$589million for state tax purposes may be carried forward
to offset future taxable income depending on state legislative
restrictions. At December31, 2003 the Company has a
research and experimentation credit carry forward of
approximately $43million that will begin to expire in the
year 2021, if not utilized. In 2002, the Company analyzed the sources and the
expected reversal periods of its deferred tax assets, and
determined that they did not meet the realization criteria under
generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the
Company has established a valuation allowance of
$171million and $235million as of
December31, 2002 and 2003 respectively. In the future,
should management conclude that these deferred tax assets are,
at least in part, realizable, the valuation allowance will be
reversed to the extent of such realization. In general the
reversal of the valuation allowance, if any, would be recognized
as a deferred income tax benefit in the statement of operations.
However, the valuation allowance at December31, 2003
includes a reserve established at the time of the Paragon
acquisition related to net deferred tax assets acquired of
approximately $63million. Should the Company reverse the
valuation allowance with respect to the acquired net deferred
tax assets, it will be reflected as a decrease in the carrying
amount of acquired goodwill. The Company may realize tax deductions resulting
from certain exercises of employee stock options. The excess of
tax benefits realized from such exercises over the amount of
stock compensation expense recorded in the Companys
financial statements is generally reflected as an increase to
additional paid-in capital. The Company recorded $127,000 of
such tax benefit in 2001. In addition, a portion of the
Companys net operating loss carryforward relates to such
tax deductions in 2002 and 2003. Should the Company reverse the
$11million valuation allowance related to these
stock-based compensation benefits, it will be reflected as an
increase to additional paid-in capital. 7.Stock
Options Pursuant to the Companys 1998 stock option
plan the Plan, a committee appointed by the
Companys Board of Directors may grant incentive and
nonqualified options to employees, consultants and directors.
The Plan currently authorizes the grant of options to purchase
up to 8,092,514shares of authorized common stock.
Incentive stock options have a ten-year term and non-qualified
stock options have a five-year term. A majority of the stock
options vest 25% on the first anniversary date of the grant and
625% each quarter thereafter, with the remaining stock options
vesting 100% four years from the grant date. As of
December31, 2003, the Company had outstanding options to
purchase 3,799,623shares of common stock, and had options
to purchase 1,884,820shares of common stock available to
grant. 50 Table of Contents The following summarizes stock option activity

As discussed in Note1, the Company applies
APB25 and related interpretations in accounting for stock
options issued to employees and directors. As a result, for
options issued with exercise prices below the fair value on the
date of grant, the Company recorded deferred compensation
expense totaling approximately $1,227,000 for options granted
during the year ended December31, 1997, and $1,921,000 for
options granted during the year ended December31, 1998.
Such deferred compensation expense was amortized to operations
over the forty-eight month option vesting period. Amortization
expense totaled approximately $449,000, $199,000 and $53,000 for
the years ended December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003
respectively. The Company reversed $510,000, $202,000 and $0 in
2001, 2002, and 2003 respectively, against additional paid-in
capital for forfeitures of deferred stock compensation related
to stock options issued at less than fair value. Beginning August20, 2001, the Company
offered eligible employees who held stock options with a price
greater than or equal to $1000per share under the Plan
the opportunity to exchange certain outstanding options 51 Table of Contents to purchase shares of Carrier Access common stock
for new options granted on March20, 2002. The options
issued on March20, 2002 had strike prices equal to the
fair value of the underlying stock on that date. Eligible
employees who participated in the option exchange received a
number of shares subject to new options for every share subject
to the options tendered which varied according to the most
recent performance rating received by the employee under the
Companys performance rating system. Options to purchase a
total of 1,781,619shares with an aggregate exercise price
of $46million as of September18, 2001 were
exchanged pursuant to the offer. In addition to options issued to employees and
directors, the Company issued options to purchase
62,500shares of common stock to consultants for services
during the year ended December31, 2001. These options have
exercise prices from $280 to $650per share, are
exercisable at the date of grant and expire at various dates
from January2, 2006 to October16, 2006. The fair
value of these options was determined to be $127,000 and was
recognized in general and administrative expense. The fair value
was calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 381 contractual life of five years; no dividend yield; and 102%
volatility. As of December31, 2003 none of these options
have been exercised. There were no options issued to consultants
for services in 2002. In 2003, the Company issued options to purchase
25,000shares of common stock to consultants for services
during the year. These options had an exercise price of
$077per share and were immediately exercisable. The fair
market value of these options was determined to be $24,000 and
was recognized in general and administrative expense. The fair
value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of
30% contractual lives of five years; no dividend yield; and
111% volatility. These options were exercised on April11,
2003. 8.Significant
Customers, Suppliers and Concentration of Credit Risk Customers are primarily distributors and original
equipment manufacturers, who resell the Companys products

Although the Company generally uses standard
parts and components for its products, many key components are
purchased from sole or single source vendors for which
alternative sources may not currently be available. The
identification and utilization of new suppliers for such items
could adversely effect the Companys future operating
results. The Company is exposed to potential
concentrations of credit risk from its accounts receivable with
its various customers and receivables are concentrated in
customers in the telecommunications industry. To reduce this
risk, the Company has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness
of its customers and monitors the aging of its accounts
receivable for potential uncollectible accounts. An allowance is
recorded for estimate losses from writeoffs of uncollectible
accounts. Bad debt expense went from a $56million expense
in 2002 to a $31million recovery in 2003. In 2002, a
number of our customers filed for bankruptcy and one of our
distributors was experiencing financial difficulties which
caused a significant amount of accounts receivables to become
delinquent. In 2003, we were able to recover some of the
delinquent receivables and part of the accounts receivable
related to the bankruptcy 52 Table of Contents 9.Employee
Benefit Plan The Company has a defined contribution employee
benefit plan the 401k Plan under
Section401k of the Internal Revenue Code which is
available to all employees who meet the 401k Plans
eligibility requirements. Employees may contribute up to the
maximum limits allowed by the Internal Revenue Code. At the
beginning of 2001, the Company began matching 50% of the
employees pre-tax contributions, up to 6% of each
participating employees annual salary. Effective
January1, 2003, this matching contribution was suspended.
Contributions to the 401k Plan by the Company totaled
$860,000, $650,000 and $0, respectively, for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003. 10.Commitments
and Contingencies The Company leases office space under various
noncancelable-operating leases that expire through 2009. The
Company also leases copiers under various capital leases which
expire in 2006. Future obligations under these leases are as

The Company records rent expense under
noncancelable operating leases using the straight-line method
after consideration of increases in rental payments over the
lease term, and records the difference between actual payments
and rent expense as deferred rent concessions. The Company has placed non-cancellable certain
purchase orders for $127million of inventory from certain
of its vendors for delivery in 2004. These orders are generally
placed up to 4months in advance based on the lead time of
the inventory. Rent expense for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002, and 2003 totaled
$15million, and $19million, and $16million
respectively. On December28, 2001, SCI,Inc., a
contract manufacturer, filed a breach of contract claim for
$45million against the Company in Alabama Circuit Court
based on an inventory-purchasing dispute. On September18,
2002, this claim was settled and the Company entered into a
manufacturing arrangement for the Broadmore product. On August16, 2002, SMTC Manufacturing
Corporation of Colorado filed a breach of contract claim, and
other related claims, for a total of $134million against
the Company in District Court, County of Adams, Colorado, based
on an inventory-purchasing dispute. On October17, 2002,
the Company filed a breach of contract counterclaim, and other
related counterclaims, in District Court, County of Adams,
Colorado for $10million. On December5, 2002, the
Company amended its counterclaim to $270million. The
Company currently has insufficient information to make an
estimate of the outcome of this litigation. As such, no
provision for any potential liability or asset that may result
has been made in the consolidated financial statements. The
Company intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit. 11.Subsequent
Events In February of 2004, the Company completed an
underwritten public offering of its common stock. The Company
sold a total of 69million shares for $1225per
share. The Company received proceeds of $785million, net
of underwriters commissions and other offering costs. 53 Table of Contents 12.Quarterly

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures. Our management evaluated,
with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on this evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose
in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and forms. Changes in internal control over financial
reporting. There was no change in our
internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 55 Table of Contents PARTIII
