REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Billing Concepts Corp.    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Billing
Concepts Corp. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30,
2000 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Billing Concepts Corp. and
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States.                            /s/ ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP

BILLING CONCEPTS CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, 1999 AND 1998
NOTE 1. BUSINESS ACTIVITY
Billing Concepts Corp. BCC, formerly known as Billing Information
Concepts Corp., was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1996. BCC was
previously a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Long Distance Corp. USLD that,
upon its spin-off from USLD, became an independent, publicly held company. BCC
and its subsidiaries collectively, the Company provide Internet-based
automated loan approval products to the financial services industries, through
its wholly owned subsidiary, FIData, Inc. FIData. Through its Transaction
Processing division, the Company provided billing clearinghouse and information
management services Transaction Processing services in the United States to
the telecommunications industry. Through its subsidiary, Aptis, Inc., the
Company Software division Software developed, licensed and supported
convergent billing systems for telecommunications and Internet service providers
and provided direct billing outsourcing services.
On October 23, 2000, the Company completed the sale of the Transaction
Processing and Software divisions to Platinum Equity Holdings Platinum of
Los Angeles, California the Transaction. Total consideration consisted of
$525 million in cash and a royalty, assuming achievement of certain revenue
targets associated with the divested divisions, of up to $20 million. In
addition, the Company will receive payments totaling $75 million for consulting
services provided to Platinum over the twenty-four month period subsequent to
the Transaction. All financial information presented has been restated to
reflect the Transaction Processing and Software divisions as discontinued
operations as of September 30, 2000, in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations. Pursuant to
the Transaction agreement, the Company will change its name and Nasdaq National
Market symbol prior to May 31, 2001.
The unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Balance Sheet includes adjustments
that give effect to the Transaction, as if the disposition had occurred on
September 30, 2000. The pro forma adjustments reflect the elimination of the
divested operations, the consideration received at the closing of the
Transaction $525 million and estimated transaction costs.
NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
BCC and its wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. The Company 425%
investment in the capital stock of Princeton eCom Corporation Princeton and
22% investment in the stock of COREINTELLECT, Inc. CORE see Note 7 are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.
ESTIMATES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES
The Company recognizes revenue from its Internet division when loan
approvals are processed by the Company. The Company recorded bad debt expense of
$38,000, $0 and $0 and recorded bad debt write-offs of $25,000, $0 and $0 to its
allowance for doubtful accounts for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, for
continuing operations.
29
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
Accounts receivable consists of receivables from FIData operations, as
well as a $48 million income tax receivable from the Internal Revenue Service.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
related assets, which range from three to seven years. Upon disposition, the
cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the
accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income expense
for that period. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred and major improvements are capitalized.
OTHER ASSETS
Other assets include goodwill and other intangibles related to the
acquisition of FIData, which is being amortized over a five-year period see
Note 7. In addition, long-term deposits and security investments have been
included in other assets.
COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND
On January 9, 1998, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a one-for-one common stock dividend. The dividend was distributed on
January 30, 1998 to stockholders of record on January 20, 1998. No additional
proceeds were received on the dividend date and all costs associated with the
share dividend were capitalized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.
All share and per share information in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements has been adjusted to give retroactive effect to the stock dividend.
TREASURY STOCK
In the first quarter of 2000, the Company Board of Directors approved
the adoption of a common stock repurchase program. Under the terms of the
program, the Company may purchase up to a total of $10 million of Company common
stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. At September
30, 2000, the Company had repurchased $19 million, or 504,800 shares, of
treasury stock under this program see Note 19.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair values of the Company cash and cash equivalents and
all other financial instruments have been determined using appropriate valuation
methodologies and approximate their related carrying values.
INCOME TAXES
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on enacted income
tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the period in which the deferred
tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. A change in the
tax laws or rates results in adjustments to the deferred tax assets and
liabilities. The effects of such adjustments are required to be included in
income in the period in which the tax laws or rates are changed.
NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 128, Earnings
Per Share, established standards for computing and presenting earnings per
share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or potential common
stock. SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the
face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures.
Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or
other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings
of the Company. As the Company had a net loss from continuing operations for the
years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, diluted EPS equals basic EPS, as
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are antidilutive in loss periods.
If the Company would have had net income from
30
continuing operations for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, the
denominator weighted average number of common shares and common share
equivalents outstanding in the diluted EPS calculation would have been
increased, through application of the treasury stock method, for each class of
options for which the average market price per share of the Company common
stock exceeded the common stock equivalent exercise price.
For the year ended September 30, 2000, certain options to purchase
7,852,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $394 to $2900 per
share would not have been included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares. There were additional options to purchase 317,000 shares of common stock
at prices ranging from $198 to $363 per share which were excluded as they were
antidilutive for the net loss from continuing operations incurred for the year
ended September 30, 2000.
For the year ended September 30, 1999, certain options to purchase
5,535,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $571 to $2900 per
share would not have been included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares. There were additional options to purchase 569,000 shares of common stock
at prices ranging from $198 to $450 per share which were excluded as they were
antidilutive for the net loss from continuing operations incurred for the year
ended September 30, 1999.
For the year ended September 30, 1998, certain options to purchase
2,592,000 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $1300 to $2900 per
share would not have been included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares. There were additional options and warrants to purchase 1,644,000 shares
of common stock at prices ranging from $315 to $1238 per share which were
excluded as they were antidilutive for the net loss from continuing operations
incurred for the year ended September 30, 1998.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements, which provides the SEC views in applying generally accepted

NOTE 5. DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS
In December 1996, the Company secured a $500 million revolving line of
credit facility with certain lenders primarily to draw upon to advance funds to
its billing customers prior to collection of the funds from the local exchange
carriers. This credit facility terminated on March 20, 2000. The Company
currently does not have a need for a line of credit due to its significant cash
resources resulting from the Transaction described in Note 1.
NOTE 6. LEASES
The Company leases certain equipment and office space under operating
leases. Rental expense was $3,000 for fiscal year 2000 and $0 for fiscal years
1999 and 1998. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating
leases as of September 30, 2000 are $3,000 for fiscal year 2001 and $0 for all
years thereafter. During November 2000, the Company entered into a lease
agreement for office space, commencing in January 2001. Under this agreement,
the Company will have future minimum lease payments of $103,000 for fiscal year
2001, $155,000 for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and $52,000 for fiscal year 2004.

NOTE 7. ACQUISITIONS
In September 1998, the Company acquired 22% of the capital stock of
Princeton for $10 million. Princeton is a privately held company located in
Princeton, New Jersey specializing in electronic bill publishing utilizing the
Internet and telephone. During 1999, the Company acquired additional shares of
Princeton stock, increasing the Company ownership position to approximately
24% at September 30, 1999. The Company accounts for this investment under the
equity method of accounting. The excess of the Company investment in equity
affiliates greater than its underlying share of net assets is being amortized
over ten years.
In connection with the acquisition of the 22% ownership position in
Princeton, the Company acquired certain intangible assets, including developed
technology, customer relationships and goodwill. In connection with this
allocation, $20 million was expensed as a charge for the purchase of in-process
research and development. In performing this allocation, the Company considered,
among other factors, Princeton research and development projects in-process at
the date of acquisition. With regard to the in-process research and development
projects, the Company considered factors such as the stage of development of the
technology at the time of acquisition, the importance of each project to the
overall development plan, alternative future use of the technology and the
projected incremental cash flows from the projects when completed and any
associated risks.
The purchased in-process research and development focused on next
generation Internet-based bill publishing and payment systems and solutions. The
fair value assigned to these projects was approximately $20 million. Due to its
specialized nature, the in-process research and development projects had no
alternative future use, either for re-deployment elsewhere in the business or in
liquidation, in the event the project failed.
The Income Approach was the primary technique utilized in valuing the
purchased research and development. The valuation technique employed in the
appraisal was designed to properly reflect all intellectual property rights in
the intangible assets, including core technology. The value of the developed
technology was derived from direct sales of existing products, including their
contribution to in-process research and development. In this way, value was
properly attributed to the engineering know-how embedded in the existing product
that will be used in developmental products. The appraisal also considered the
fact that the existing know-how diminishes in value over time as new
technologies are developed and changes in market conditions render current
products and methodologies obsolete. The assumptions underlying the cash flow
projections used were derived primarily from investment banking reports,
historical results, company records and discussions with management.
Revenue estimates for each in-process project were developed by management
and based on an assessment of the industry. Cost of goods sold for each project
are expected to be in line with historical results. The Capital Asset Pricing
Model was used to determine the cost of capital discount rate for Princeton
in-process projects. Due to the technological and economic risks associated with
the developmental projects, a discount rate of 20% was used to discount cash
flows from the in-process projects. The Company believes that the foregoing
assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the
acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the underlying assumptions
used to estimate sales, development costs or profitability, or the events
associated with such projects, will transpire as estimated. For these reasons,
actual results may vary from projected results. The most significant and
uncertain assumptions relating to the in-process projects relate to the
projected timing of completion and revenues attributable to each project.
In November 1999, the Company completed the acquisition of FIData, a
company located in Austin, Texas that provides Internet-based automated loan
approval products to the financial services industries. Total consideration for
the acquisition was approximately $42 million in cash and debt assumption and
1,100,000 shares of the Company common stock. This acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the results of operations for FIData
have been included in the Company consolidated financial statements, and the
shares related to the acquisition have been included in the weighted average
shares outstanding for purposes of calculating net income loss per common
share since the date of acquisition. Approximately $74 million was recorded as
goodwill and other intangibles and is included in Other assets. During the first
quarter of 2000, the Company expensed $17 million of in-process R acquired in
connection with this acquisition.
In March 2000, the Company increased its ownership percentage in Princeton
with an additional $335 million equity investment, which consisted of $270
million of convertible preferred stock and $65 million of common stock. In
33
connection with this investment, the Company expensed $25 million of in-process
R costs during 2000. In June 2000, under the terms of a Convertible Promissory
Note, the Company advanced $50 million to Princeton. During the fourth quarter
of 2000, the Convertible Promissory Note was converted into shares of Princeton
preferred stock, which is convertible into 1,111,111 shares of Princeton common
stock. The Company ownership percentage in Princeton at September 30, 2000,
was approximately 425% see Note 17.
In March 2000, the Company completed the purchase of a voting preferred
stock investment of $60 million in CORE, a Dallas, Texas-based company that
develops and markets Internet-based business-to-business products for the
acquisition, classification, retention and dissemination of business-critical
knowledge and information. During 2000, the Company expensed $25 million of
in-process R costs acquired in connection with this equity investment.
In connection with the acquisition of FIData and the investments in
Princeton and CORE, the Company acquired certain intangible assets, including
goodwill and in-process research and development. In connection with these
allocations, the Company expensed approximately $17 million of the purchase
price for FIData and $25 million of each of its equity investments in Princeton
and CORE as in-process research and development. In performing these
allocations, the Company considered the respective company research and
development projects in process at the date of acquisition, among other factors
such as the stage of development of the technology at the time of investment,
the importance of each project to the overall development plan, alternative
future use of the technology and the projected incremental cash flows from the
projects when completed and any associated risks.
The in-process research and development purchased from FIData focused on
next generation Internet-based automated loan approval products and banking
systems and solutions. The in-process research and development purchased from
Princeton focused on next generation Internet-based bill publishing and payment
systems and solutions. The in-process research and development purchased from
CORE focused on next generation Internet-based acquisition, classification,
retention and dissemination of business-critical knowledge and information. Due
to their specialized nature, the in-process research and development projects
had no alternative future use, either for re-deployment elsewhere in the
business or in liquidation, in the event the projects failed.
The Income Approach was the primary technique utilized in valuing the
purchased research and development. The valuation technique employed in the
appraisals was designed to properly reflect all intellectual property rights in
the intangible assets, including core technology. The value of the developed
technology was derived from direct sales of existing products, including their
contribution to in-process research and development. In this way, value was
properly attributed to the engineering know-how embedded in the existing product
that will be used in developmental products. The appraisals also considered the
fact that the existing know-how diminishes in value over time as new
technologies are developed and changes in market conditions render current
products and methodologies obsolete. The assumptions underlying the cash flow
projections used were derived primarily from investment banking reports,
historical results, company records and discussions with management.
Revenue estimates for each in-process project were developed by management
and based on an assessment of the industry. Cost of goods sold for each project
is expected to be in line with historical industry accepted pricing. Due to the
technological and economic risks associated with the developmental projects,
discount rates of 35%, 25% and 40% were used to discount cash flows from the
in-process projects for FIData, Princeton and CORE, respectively. The Company
believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at
the time of the acquisition. No assurance can be given, however, that the
underlying assumptions used to estimate sales, development costs or
profitability, or the events associated with such projects, will transpire as
estimated. For these reasons, actual results may vary from projected results.
The most significant and uncertain assumptions relating to the in-process
projects relate to the projected timing of completion and revenues attributable
to each project.
NOTE 8. SPECIAL CHARGES
During 2000, the Company recognized special charges in the amount of $22
million. Special charges related primarily to the $17 million of in-process
research and development costs acquired in connection with the acquisition of
FIData see Note 7.
34
NOTE 9. SHARE CAPITAL
On July 10, 1996, the Company, upon authorization by its Board of
Directors, adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan Rights Plan and declared a
dividend of one preferred share purchase right on each share of its outstanding
common stock. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires
15% or more of the Company common stock or announces a tender offer, the
consummation of which would result in ownership by a person or group of 15% or
more of the Company common stock. These rights, which expire on July 10, 2006,
entitle stockholders to buy one ten-thousandth of a share of a new series of
participating preferred shares at a purchase price of $130 per one
ten-thousandth of a preferred share. The Rights Plan was designed to ensure that
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed
takeover of the Company.
No cash dividends were paid on the Company common stock during fiscal
2000, 1999 or 1998.
NOTE 10. STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS
The Company has adopted the BCC 1996 Employee Comprehensive Stock Plan
Comprehensive Plan and the BCC 1996 Non-Employee Director Plan Director
Plan under which officers and employees, and non-employee directors,
respectively, of the Company and its affiliates are eligible to receive stock
option grants. Employees of the Company also are eligible to receive restricted
stock grants under the Comprehensive Plan. The Company has reserved 14,500,000
and 1,300,000 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant to the
Comprehensive Plan and Director Plan, respectively. Under each plan, options
vest and expire pursuant to individual award agreements; however, the expiration
date of unexercised options may not exceed ten years from the date of grant
under the Comprehensive Plan and five and seven years for automatic and
discretionary grants, respectively, under the Director Plan.
For those employees who became Platinum employees in connection with the
Transaction, the Company offered two elections to amend their options. Under the
first election, as long as the employee did not voluntarily terminate employment
with Platinum within six months of the date of the Transaction, all vested
options at the time of the Transaction remain exercisable for eighteen months
subsequent to the Transaction. All unvested options at the time of the
Transaction shall vest six months subsequent to the Transaction and shall remain
exercisable for one year from such vesting date. Under the second election, as
long as the employee remained a Platinum employee, their vesting options
continued to vest according to their vesting schedule and remain exercisable
through the expiration date as defined in the respective agreement. The
compensation expense related to the amendment of the vesting periods was
minimal.
Option activity for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 is

The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, but has elected to apply APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock option plans as allowed under SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, the Company has
not recognized compensation expense for stock options granted where the exercise
price is equal to the market price of the underlying stock at the date of the
grant. During fiscal year 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company recognized $240,000 255,000 and $726,000, respectively, of compensation expense for options granted
below the market price of the underlying stock on such measurement date. In
addition, in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, the Company
has not recognized compensation expense for employee stock purchases under the
Billing Concepts Corp. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
Had compensation expense for the Company stock options granted and ESPP
purchases in 2000, 1999 and 1998 been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates consistent with the methodology of SFAS No. 123, pro forma net
income loss and net income loss per common share would have been as follows
in thousands, except per share amounts                               YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

the year ended September 30, 2000, $356 and $618 for the year ended September
30, 1999, and $229 and $1065 for the year ended September 30, 1998. For
purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of options is
amortized to pro forma compensation expense over the options' vesting periods.
Warrants to purchase 201,252 shares of common stock were exercised in
fiscal 1998. There were no warrants outstanding at September 30, 1999 and 2000.

The Billing Concepts Corp. 401k Retirement Plan the Retirement Plan
was assumed by Platinum in connection with the Transaction. During 2000,
employees who will continue to be employees of the Company subsequent to the
Transaction were eligible to participate in the Retirement Plan see Note 18.
In November 2000, the Company established the Billing Concepts Corp. 401k Plan
the Plan for eligible employees of the Company. Generally, all employees of
the Company who are at least 21 years of age and who have completed one-half
year of service are eligible to participate in the Plan. The Plan is a defined
contribution plan which provides that participants generally may make voluntary
salary deferral contributions, on a pretax basis, between 1% and 15% of their
compensation in the form of voluntary payroll deductions, up to a maximum amount
as indexed for cost-of-living adjustments. The Company will match a
participant salary deferral, up to 5% of a participant compensation. The
Company may make additional discretionary contributions.
The Billing Concepts Corp. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which
was established under the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, is offered to eligible employees of the Company. The
37
Company has reserved 2,000,000 shares of its common stock for issuance pursuant
to the ESPP. The ESPP enables employees who have completed at least six months
of continuous service with the Company to purchase shares of BCC common stock
at a 15% discount through voluntary payroll deductions. The purchase price is
the lesser of 85% of the closing price of the common stock on the opening date
of each participation period or 85% of the closing price of the common stock on
the ending date of each participation period. The Company issued 46,000, 45,232
and 6,863 shares of its common stock in January, July and September 2000
pursuant to the ESPP at purchase prices of $499, $372 and $271, respectively.
The Company issued 41,326 and 56,360 shares of its common stock in January and
July 1999 pursuant to the ESPP at purchase prices of $855 and $606,
respectively. The Company issued 14,659 and 27,561 shares of its common stock in
January and July 1998 pursuant to the ESPP at purchase prices of $1599 and
$1132, respectively.
NOTE 13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
A lawsuit was filed on December 31, 1998, in the United States District
Court in San Antonio, Texas by an alleged stockholder of the Company against the
Company and various of its officers and directors, alleging unspecified damages
as a result of alleged false statements in various press releases prior to
November 19, 1998. In September 1999, the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Texas entered an order and judgment dismissing the plaintiff
lawsuit. The plaintiff noticed an appeal of that decision on September 29, 1999.
In November 2000, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
dismissed the appeal pursuant to a stipulation of the parties and settlement.
As previously disclosed, the Company has been engaged in discussions with
the staff of the Federal Trade Commission FTC Bureau of Consumer
Protection regarding a proposed complaint by the FTC alleging potential
liability arising primarily from the alleged cramming of charges for
non-regulated telecommunication services by certain of its customers. Cramming
is the addition of charges to a telephone bill for programs, products or
services the consumer did not knowingly authorize. These allegations relate to
businesses conducted by the subsidiaries sold by the Company on October 23,
2000. Management cannot assess either the likelihood that this matter will have
an adverse financial impact on the Company or the extent of any such impact.
The Company is involved in various other claims, legal actions and
regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company
believes it is unlikely that the final outcome of any of the claims, litigation
or proceedings to which the Company is a party will have a material adverse
effect on the Company financial position or results of operations; however,
due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that
the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company results of operations for the fiscal period in
which such resolution occurs.
NOTE 14. RELATED PARTIES
From time to time, the Company has made advances to or was owed amounts
from certain officers of the Company. The highest aggregate amount outstanding
of advances to officers during the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 was
$252,000. The Company had a $50,000 note receivable bearing interest at 100%
from an officer of the Company at September 30, 2000. The Company had a $69,000
note receivable bearing interest at 70% from an officer of the Company at
September 30, 1999. On January 4, 2000, the Company forgave a certain note

On April 5, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a
restricted stock grant to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The
restricted stock consists of 400,000 shares of Princeton common stock, which
vests on April 30, 2003. The Company expenses the fair market value of the
restricted stock grant over the three-year period ending April 30, 2003. The
Company recognized $03 million during fiscal 2000 as compensation expense
related to the stock grant. The Company estimates it will recognize $05 million
as compensation expense related to the stock grant in 2001.
The Company chartered a jet airplane from a company associated with an
officer/director of the Company. Under the terms of the charter agreement, the
Company was obligated to pay annual minimum fees of $500,000 over the five years
ending March 31, 2003 for such charter services. During the fourth quarter of
2000, the Company terminated this contract
38
with no future obligations. During the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999,
the Company paid approximately $615,000 and $727,000, respectively, in fees
related to this agreement.
During 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to guarantee the terms
of a lease of Princeton see Note 5 for office space in Princeton, New Jersey.
The terms of the lease require aggregate payments of approximately $107 million
through December 2009. This guarantee terminates should Princeton raise $25
million of capital through a public offering. The Company does not believe it is
probable that the lease guarantee will be exercised.

REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES
The Company recognized revenue from its Transaction Processing services
when records that were to be billed and collected by the Company were processed.
Revenue from the sale of convergent billing systems, including the licensing of
software rights, was recognized at the time the product was delivered to the
customer, provided that the Company had no significant related obligations or
collection uncertainties remaining. If there were significant obligations
related to the installation or development of the system delivered, revenue was
recognized in the period that the Company fulfilled the obligation. Services
revenues related to the Software division were recognized in the period that the
services were provided. The Company recorded bad debt expense of $6,801,000 1,774,000 and $292,000 and recorded bad debt expense write-offs of $3,836,000 486,000 and $56,000 to its allowance for doubtful accounts for 2000, 1999 and

leases for discontinued operations. Rental expense was $4,727,000, $3,918,000
and $2,948,000 for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Under the
terms of the Transaction, all leases associated with Transaction Processing and
Software divisions were assumed by Platinum. The Company guaranteed two of the
operating leases of the divested divisions. Management does not believe that the

ACQUISITIONS
In October 1998, the Company acquired Expansion Systems Corporation
ESC, a privately held company headquartered in Glendale, California that
develops and markets billing and registration systems to Internet Service
Providers under its flagship products TOTALBILL and INSTANTREG. An aggregate of
170,000 shares of the Company common stock was issued in connection with this
transaction, which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests. The
consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the combination have not
been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of ESC due to
the transaction not having a significant impact on the Company prior period
financial position or results of operations as none of ESC assets,
liabilities, revenues, expenses or income loss exceeded 2% of the Company
consolidated respective amounts as of or for any of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 1998.
In December 1998, the Company completed the merger of Communications
Software Consultants, Inc. CommSoft in consideration of 2,492,759 shares of
the Company common stock. CommSoft was a privately held, international
software development and consulting firm specializing in the telecommunications
industry. The business combination has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests. The consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the
combination have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations
of CommSoft. The revenues and net income for CommSoft from October 1, 1998 to
the date of the merger were approximately $38 million and $04 million,
respectively.
In April 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of Operator Service
Company OSC, a Lubbock, Texas-based provider of inbound directory
assistance, interactive voice response and customer relationship management
services to the telecommunications and consumer products industries. The Company
acquired OSC through the issuance of 38 million shares of common stock, of
which 07 million shares were held in escrow until achievement of a certain
level of earnings. This acquisition is accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of OSC have been included
in the Company consolidated financial statements, and the shares related to
the acquisition have been included in the weighted average shares outstanding
for purposes of calculating net loss per common share since the date of
acquisition. A portion of the total purchase price of $192 million has been
allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair
market value at the date of acquisition. The additional balance of $171 million
was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over twenty years on a
straight-line basis. In connection with the Transaction, the 07 million shares
held in escrow were released.
SPECIAL CHARGES
During the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company recognized special
charges in the amount of $12 million related to severance related costs. During
the third quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a $35 million charge related to
the Software division. The charge was a result of the narrowing of various
software product offerings, the refocusing of software development efforts and a
reserve associated with a significant customer account.
42
Benefit Plans
Participation in the Retirement Plan was offered to eligible employees of
the Company. Generally, all employees of the Company who were 21 years of age or
older and who had completed six months of service during which they worked at
least 500 hours were eligible for participation in the Retirement Plan. The
Retirement Plan was a defined contribution plan which provided that participants
generally make voluntary salary deferral contributions, on a pretax basis, of
between 1% and 15% of their compensation in the form of voluntary payroll
deductions up to a maximum amount as indexed for cost-of-living adjustments. The
Company made matching contributions as a percentage determined annually of the
first 5% of a participant compensation contributed as salary deferral. The
Company could have made additional discretionary contributions. No discretionary
contributions were made in fiscal 2000, 1999 or 1998. During 2000, 1999 and
1998, the Company matching contributions to this plan totaled approximately
$894,000, $635,000 and $392,000, respectively.
