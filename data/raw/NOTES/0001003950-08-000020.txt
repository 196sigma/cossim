70  39 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Performance Technologies, Incorporated In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Performance Technologies, Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for unrecognized tax benefits on January 1, 2007. As discussed in Note A to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for share-based payments on January 1, 2006.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 40 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

PERFORMANCE TECHNOLOGIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note A - Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The Company: Performance Technologies, Incorporated the Company was formed in 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware and maintains its corporate offices in Rochester, New York. The Company is a supplier of integrated IP-based platforms and solutions for advanced communications networks and innovative computer system architectures which are used in a broad range of applications and end markets. Segment Data, Geographic Information and Significant Customers: The Company is not organized by market and is managed and operated as one business. A single management team that reports to the chief operating decision maker comprehensively manages the entire business. The Company does not operate any material separate lines of business or separate business entities. Accordingly, the Company does not accumulate discrete financial information, other than product revenue, with respect to separate product lines and does not have separately reportable segments as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Shipments to customers outside of the United States represented 48%, 49% and 43% of sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, export shipments to the United Kingdom represented 13%, 14% and 14% of sales, respectively. The Company does not maintain significant amounts of long-lived assets outside of the United States. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, four customers accounted for approximately 34%, 38% and 46% of sales respectively. In 2007, two customers, Data Connection Limited and Alcatel-Lucent constituted 11% and 10% of sales, respectively. In 2006, Alcatel-Lucent and Data Connection accounted for 18% and 12% of sales, respectively. In 2005, Alcatel-Lucent and Data Connection comprised 25% and 12% of sales, respectively. During each of these years, Alcatel-Lucent purchased switching products and Data Connection purchased computing products. The percentages presented for 2006 and 2005 have been revised to give effect to the 2006 merger of Lucent Technologies, Inc. and Alcatel. Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. Foreign Currency Translation: The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured at year-end exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are re-measured at historical rates. Revenues, expenses, gains and losses are re-measured using the rates on which those elements were recognized during the period. Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Concentration of Credit Risk: Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of bank deposits, investments, and accounts receivable. Investments consist of high quality, interest bearing financial instruments. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains an allowance for
uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2007, one customer, Raytheon, represented 12% of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2006, Alcatel-Lucent and Data Connection represented 11% and 10% of net accounts receivable, respectively.  46 Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying amounts of the Company accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values at December 31, 2007 and 2006, as the maturity of these instruments are generally short term. The fair value of investments is discussed in Note B Investments. Cash Equivalents: The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Investments: The Company classifies its investments as available-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. These investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders equity. The Company records losses that are other-than-temporary, if any, in net income.  Investments consist of auction rate municipal debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Auction rate municipal securities are variable rate debt instruments which bear interest rates that reset approximately every 35days, but which have contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years. The auction rate municipal securities owned by the Company were rated AAA by a major credit rating agency and are generally commercially insured.  Inventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out method. The Company records provisions for excess, obsolete or slow moving inventory based on changes in customer demand, technology developments or other economic factors. Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition. Product sales represent the majority of the Companys revenue and include hardware products and hardware products with embedded software. The Company recognizes revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been provided, the sale price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, the Company sells its products on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location, typically shipping point. Accordingly, revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met, including transfer of title and
risk of loss, which typically occurs upon shipment by the Company. If these conditions are not met, the Company will defer revenue recognition until such time as these conditions have been satisfied. Revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. For the sale of multiple-element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements, such as software and maintenance, the Company allocates to, and recognizes revenue from, the various elements based on their fair value. Revenue from software requiring significant production, modification, or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting. Anticipated losses on contracts, if any, are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined. If all conditions of revenue recognition are not met, the Company defers revenue recognition and will recognize revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the arrangement. Revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over
the contractual period. 47 Revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered.  The Company also sells certain products through distributors who are granted limited rights of return. Potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale.  Property, Equipment and Improvements: Property, equipment and improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation of equipment and improvements is provided for using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives   
Engineering equipment and software 
3 - 5 years 
Manufacturing equipment 
3 - 5 years 
Furniture and equipment 
3 - 5 years 
Leasehold improvements 
the lesser of 10 years or the lease term  Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Asset betterments are capitalized. Long-Lived Assets: The Company regularly assesses all of its long-lived assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Research and Development: Research and development costs, excluding amounts capitalized as software development costs, are expensed as incurred and include employee related costs, office expenses and new product prototyping costs. Shipping and Handling Costs: Amounts charged to customers and costs incurred by the Company related to shipping and handling are included in net sales and cost of goods sold, respectively, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-10, Accounting for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs. Advertising: Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in Selling and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising expense amounted to $180,000, $129,000 and $82,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Software Development Costs: On a product-by-product basis, software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility and prior to general release of the product are capitalized and amortized commencing after general release over its estimated remaining economic life, generally three years, or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such software, whichever provides greater amortization. Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, the Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur. Effective January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation FIN No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No109. FIN 48 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions tax contingencies accounted for in accordance with SFAS No109. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. In making this assessment, the Company must assume that the taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is
to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may or may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. 48 The Company reports interest and penalties accrued relating to uncertain income tax positions as a component of income tax provision. The liability for uncertain income tax positions is presented in the accompanying December 31, 2007 balance sheet as a non-current liability Income Taxes Payable as it cannot be known if, or when, this liability will be satisfied. Upon adoption of FIN 48, a charge to retained earnings of $3,000 was recorded. As of January 1, 2007, the income tax payable relating to uncertain tax positions was $1,056,000 See Note N. Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share calculations reflect the assumed exercise and conversion of dilutive employee stock options and unvested restricted stock, applying the treasury stock method. Diluted earnings per share calculations exclude the effect of approximately 1,500,000, 1,317,000 and 1,098,000 options in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, since such options have an exercise price in excess of the average market price of the Companys common stock. Stock Options and Stock-Based Employee Compensation: In May 2001, the stockholders approved the 2001 Stock Option Plan pursuant to which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for grant. In June 2003, the stockholders approved the 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to which 1,500,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future grants. Awards under the 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock performance awards as determined by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2007, 835,000 options were available for future grant under these two stock option plans. Stock options may be granted to any officer or employee at not less than the fair market value at the date of grant not less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock. Options granted under the plans generally expire between five and ten years from the date of grant and vest in periods ranging from one to five years. Effective January 1, 2006, the provisions of SFAS No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, and related interpretations were adopted. SFAS No. 123R requires that compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements for share-based awards based on the grant-date fair value of those awards. The Company elected to employ the modified prospective transition method in adopting SFAS No. 123R. This method applies to stock options granted prior to December 31, 2005 which had unrecognized compensation expense at January 1, 2006, calculated under SFAS No. 123, as well as to any new share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123R. Stock-based compensation expense includes an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures and is recognized over the requisite service periods of the awards
on a straight-line or graded vesting basis, which is generally commensurate with the vesting term. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation expense associated with stock option grants of $678,000 and $511,000 was recorded in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Prior to January 1, 2006, stock-based compensation plans were accounted for in accordance with the provisions of APB No. 25 and related interpretations, which did not require the recognition of stock-based employee compensation in the financial statements, and SFAS No. 123, which required disclosures of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per common share to be provided for each period as if the fair
value method were applied to measure stock-based compensation expense. There was no change in the Companys accounting for restricted stock based upon the adoption of SFAS No. 123R. 49 The Company may either issue shares or utilize treasury stock shares upon employees stock option exercises. In 2007, the Company utilized its treasury stock shares for employee stock option exercises after the treasury stock program was initiated See Note K. Please refer to Note L, Stock-based Compensation Expense, for further information. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which establishes a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value in GAAP and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Specifically, this Statement sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. This Statement, as modified by FASB Staff Position FSP 157-2, is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 January 1, 2008 for the Company for financial assets and liabilities, and fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 January 1, 2009 for the
Company for non-financial assets and liabilities. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are generally required to be applied on a prospective basis, except to certain financial instruments accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, for which the provisions of SFAS No. 157 should be applied retrospectively. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of 2008, and does not expect that adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In February 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This statement permits companies to elect to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. In addition, SFAS No. 159 establishes financial statement presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities reported at fair value under the election. SFAS No159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this Statement on our financial position and results of operations. In June 2007, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No07-3, Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services to be used in Future Research and Development Activities. The EITF concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized. Such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. If an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense. The guidance in this EITF becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007. The Company does not expect this EITF to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, a revision to SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141R provides revised guidance for recognition and measurement of identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value. The Statement also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of a business combination. SFAS No. 141R is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 January 1, 2009 for the
Company. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS No. 141R on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51. This Statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent. Specifically, SFAS No. 160 requires the presentation of noncontrolling interests as equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and separate identification and presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Income of net income attributable to the entity and the noncontrolling interest. It also establishes accounting and reporting standards regarding deconsolidation and changes in a parents ownership interest. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008 January 1, 2009 for the Company. The provisions of SFAS No. 160
are generally required to be applied prospectively, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which must be applied retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 160 to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. Note B Investments At December 31, 2007 and 2006, investments consisted of high grade, auction rate municipal securities which the Company has classified as available-for-sale. At December 31, 2007, all owned securities mature in greater than ten years. As of December31, 2007, the carrying value of our investments was equal to the fair value based on successful auctions both preceding and subsequent to year end.  These investments are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates. These investments typically reset on approximately a monthly basis, and despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, the Company has historically had the ability to quickly liquidate these securities. All income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income and totaled $1,111,000, $786,000 and $403,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company continued to hold auction rate municipal securities in its investment portfolio, as described in NoteA to these financial statements. On March 14, 2008, the Company had $2,500,000 invested in one auction rate municipal security. This security, which was held at both December 31, 2007 and March 14, 2008, was involved in a successful auction in January 2008, but at the next auction in February, the auction failed. As such, the Company was not able to sell this security. The security, which was acquired in December 2007, has a face value and carrying value of $2,500,000, a maturity date of May, 2040, and carries MBIA bond credit insurance and a 10% guarantee of the Federal Family Educational Loan Program FFELP. This security carries a AAA rating. The Company continues to earn interest on this investment at a rate, which at the time the auction
failed, was increased to the contract maximum rate of 14% through May 31, 2008, at which time the contract rate will adjust to a rate equal to 175% of the J.J. Kenny Intermediate Index. It is unknown when the Company will be able to liquidate this investment or to what extent its value may now be impaired due to the auction failure and there is no assurance that auctions on this security will succeed in the future.  The Company will continue to monitor the value of its auction rate security each reporting period for a possible impairment if a decline in fair value occurs. Because the auction for this security failed subsequent to December 31, 2007, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying statement of income for 2007. The Company has the ability and intent to hold this investment until it can be sold in an orderly fashion so as to minimize any potential loss in value. Because of the uncertainty of timing as to when the Company may be able to do so, this investment has been classified as non-current in the accompanying December 31, 2007 balance sheet. 51 Note C - Accounts Receivable, net Accounts receivable consisted of the following

During 2007, the Company disposed of assets with a cost basis of $1,097,000 and accumulated depreciation of $1,081,000, and recorded a loss on disposal amounting to $16,000. During 2006, in connection with the Companys relocation of certain operations, the Company disposed of assets with a cost basis of $712,000 and accumulated depreciation of $604,000 at the time of disposals, resulting in a loss on disposal amounting to $108,000. 52 Note F Investment in Unconsolidated Company and Notes Receivable On February 18, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to invest up to $3,000,000 in InSciTek Microsystems, Inc. InSciTek, an unrelated company, in the form of an interest bearing convertible note. During 2004, the Company invested $3,000,000 in conjunction with this agreement including committed funding of $350,000 in January 2005. During the fourth quarter 2004, the Company recorded a valuation charge related to this note receivable in the amount of $3,000,000 as collection of this note was doubtful. Under the original terms of the note, the Company had the option to acquire ownership of InSciTek during a future specified period. The note bore interest at 10% annually and was convertible into shares of common stock of InSciTek. During the third quarter 2005, InSciTek received an investment from an outside party through the sale of preferred stock. In connection with that investment, the Company and InSciTek renegotiated the terms of the note. Under the amended terms, the Company forfeited the option to acquire ownership of InSciTek during a future specified period. In addition, all unpaid interest due to the Company at the date of the investment, amounting to $248,000, was paid in the form of Series A preferred stock of InSciTek. On December 30, 2006, the Company entered into a redemption agreement with InSciTek. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received $320,000 of consideration for the redemption of $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 note. In connection with the agreement, the Company reversed $181,000 of the previously recorded valuation reserve and recorded $139,000 as interest income. During the fourth quarter 2006, the Company recorded a valuation charge of $248,000 against the Companys Series A preferred stock investment in InSciTek, reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero. As a part of the redemption agreement, InSciTek was also granted the option to redeem the remaining $2,000,000 of the note by June 1, 2007, in exchange for $500,000. Other than interest income, the net impact of these transactions is included in Note Receivable Recoveries and Valuation Charge in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.  During 2007, InSciTek changed its name to Allworx Corporation Allworx. In May 2007, Allworx paid $500,000 to the Company to exercise its option to redeem the remaining $2,000,000 outstanding under its note receivable. In connection with this transaction, the Company reversed $143,000 of the previously recorded valuation reserve and recorded $357,000 as interest income. In October 2007, Allworx was acquired by a third party. In connection with the acquisition, the Company received $305,000 as consideration for its Series A preferred stock investment. $46,000 of this amount was received in 2007 and the remaining $259,000 was recorded in Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets at December 31, 2007. This amount was received subsequent to December 31, 2007. As the value of this investment had been reduced to zero in 2006, the entire consideration was recorded as Gain on Sale of Investment in 2007. Note G Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. The Company utilizes a combination of quoted market prices and discounted cash flow analysis for its impairment tests. 53 Note H - Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses consisted of the following

Under the terms of the facility lease in Rochester, New York, which expires in March 2012, the Company pays an annual rental of $768,000 with pre-established inflationary adjustments each year. Under the terms of the facility lease in San Luis Obispo, California, which expires in August 2008, the Company pays a monthly rental of approximately $10,000. This lease provides the Company options to renew for up to two 2 year periods. The lease for office space in San Diego, California requires an annual payment of $84,000 and expires in November 2010. The Company also leases office space in Kanata, Ontario, Canada. This lease, which requires an annual rental amounting to $178,000, extends through October 2011. In addition, the Company leases office space near London, England. This lease requires an annual rental of $53,000, and expires in 2012. Effective December 31, 2007, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the lease for its former location in San Luis Obispo, which was to have expired in December 2008. The required
termination payment of $505,000 was paid subsequent to December 31, 2007. A restructuring charge of $153,000 was recorded in the fourth quarter 2007 to reflect the net effect of the lease termination. 54 For the lease agreements described above, the Company is required to pay the pro rata share of the real property taxes and assessments, expenses and other charges associated with these facilities.  Future minimum payments for all operating leases having a remaining term in excess of one year at December 31, 2007 are as follows

Note J Revolving Credit Agreement The Company is a party to a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. the Bank. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $5,000,000 from the Bank. The borrowings bear interest at various rates based upon the type of borrowing, as defined in the agreement. The Credit Agreement includes certain financial and administrative covenants. The Credit Agreement terminates on December 28, 2008 at which time any outstanding borrowings must be repaid. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 or 2006. The Company intends to renew its Credit Agreement upon its expiration in December 2008, assuming its ability to do so. Note K Stock Repurchase Program On July 11, 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount not to exceed $10,000,000. Under this program, shares of the Company common stock may be repurchased through open market or private transactions, including block purchases. In July 2007, this program was extended through July 2008. Repurchased shares can be used for the Company stock option plans, potential acquisition initiatives and general corporate purposes. Under this program, the Company repurchased 1,632,600 shares during 2007 for an aggregate purchase price of $8,015,000. Of the shares repurchased, 12,820 shares with a cost of $64,000 were issued upon stock option exercises in 2007. Subsequent to December 31, 2007 and through March 9, 2008, the Company repurchased 7,756 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $37,000. 55 Note L Stock-based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes the impact of outstanding stock options and restricted stock on the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R:

$     02  The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model was used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards under SFAS No. 123R as well as for pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123. The Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model incorporates various and highly subjective assumptions, including expected term and expected volatility. For valuation purposes, stock option awards were categorized into two groups, stock option grants to employees and stock option grants to members of the Board of Directors. The expected term of options granted prior to January 1, 2006 equaled the vesting period. The expected term of options granted in 2007 and 2006 is estimated to be the average of the vesting term and the contractual life of the option. The expected volatility at the grant date is estimated using historical stock prices based upon the expected term of the options granted. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. Cash dividends have never been paid and are not anticipated to be paid in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the assumed expected dividend yield is zero. SFAS No. 123R requires pre-vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant to be estimated and periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on historical pre-vesting forfeiture data. The following table shows the detailed assumptions used to compute the fair value of stock options granted during 2007 and 2006

Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense was approximately $1,274,000 as of December 31, 2007, relating to a total of 721,000 unvested stock options under the Companys stock option plans. This stock-based compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 24 years. 56 The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2007

$941  The total intrinsic value of all outstanding options at December 31, 2007 whose exercise price was less than the Companys closing stock price on that date was $127,000. Substantially all of these options were exercisable at December 31, 2007. The total intrinsic value, determined as of the date of exercise, of options exercised in 2007 and 2006 was $62,000 and $648,000, respectively. Cash received from option exercises in 2007, 2006, and 2005, amounted to $155,000, $674,000 and $1,416,000, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during 2007 and 2006 was $488,000 and $220,000, respectively.  In 2007, of the 40,215 shares of common stock issued upon option exercise, 12,820 were issued from treasury stock and the remaining 27,395 were new shares issued. In 2006, 171,757 shares of common stock were issued from treasury and 17,163 new shares of common stock were issued for stock option exercises. 57 During 2007, stock options to purchase 127,500 shares of common stock were granted that will vest only upon the attainment of an earnings-per-share target of $40 in 2007, 2008 or 2009. Stock compensation expense has been recorded in relation to these options as management believes that the stated per-share earnings target is achievable. During 2006 and 2005, stock options to purchase 185,000 and 225,000 shares of common stock, respectively, were granted that are subject to accelerated vesting based upon the achievement of certain milestones, as defined in the option agreements. In October 2006, the option to purchase 225,000 shares of common stock terminated in connection with the resignation of the Companys former president and chief executive officer. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the Company granted stock options to purchase 429,000 shares of common stock. The assumption for vesting of the stock options granted was generally 33% per year. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for these 2005 grants: Dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility ranges of 65% to 70%, risk-free interest rate ranges of 33% to 46%, and expected life ranges of one to six years. On March 25, 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of 408,285 stock options whose exercise prices were greater than $1511 to be fully vested on that date. This acceleration resulted in $997,000 of pro forma compensation expense, determined under the fair value method, being recorded in 2005, that would have otherwise been recorded in 2006. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005 as if the provisions of SFAS No. 123 were applied using the fair value method to measure stock-based compensation

With respect to non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options that are exercised and held for less than one year, the Company recognizes a tax benefit upon exercise in an amount equal to the tax effect of the difference between the option price and the fair market value of the common stock on the exercise date. Tax benefits related to such stock option exercises are generally credited to additional paid-in capital.  58 Note M - Stockholder Rights Plan On October 27, 2000, the Companys Board of Directors adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. Under this plan, one preferred stock Purchase Right was distributed as a dividend for each share of common stock held by the stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 8, 2000. Until the occurrence of certain events, the Rights are traded as a unit with the common stock. Each Right will separate and entitle stockholders to buy stock upon the occurrence of certain events generally related to the change of control of the Company as defined in the Plan. The Rights become exercisable ten days after either   1 an Acquiring Person acquires or commences a tender offer to acquire 15% or more of the Companys common stock, or 2 an Adverse Person has acquired 10% or more of the Companys common stock and the Board determines this person is likely to cause
pressure on the Company to enter into a transaction that is not in the Companys best long-term interest.  All Rights not held by an Acquiring Person or an Adverse Person become rights to purchase from the Company one one-thousandth of one share of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of $110 per Right. Each Right entitles the holder of that Right to purchase the equivalent of $220 worth of the Companys common stock for $110. If after such an event the Company merges, consolidates or engages in a similar transaction in which it does not survive, each holder has a flip over right to buy discounted stock in the surviving entity. The Company may redeem the Rights for $001 each. The Rights Plan expires on November 1, 2010 or can be modified or terminated, at the option of the Board of Directors.

As a result of this change, the Company lowered its effective tax rate used in computing its net deferred tax assets from 38% to 36% and recorded an income tax charge amounting to $132,000. 59 A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective rates is as follows

The tax exempt interest relates to the Companys investment portfolio. The foreign sales exemption relates to the Companys extraterritorial income exclusion recorded for tax purposes. The tax uncertainties were released based upon the lapsing of the statute of limitations related to these uncertainties. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the following:

Deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and other attributes, are reviewed for expected realization and a valuation allowance is established when appropriate to reduce the assets to their estimated net realizable value. Expected realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction and period that is also of the appropriate character. The Company has evaluated the availability of such taxable income, the nature of its deferred tax assets and the relevant tax laws in determining the net realizable value of its deferred tax assets. The following table summarizes the activity in the valuation allowance account for 2007 and 2006

Expiration of state net operating losses

Balance, December 31, 2007 
$   157,000  The 2007 decrease to the valuation allowance is related to the expiration of the related state net operating loss carryforwards due to the Companys decision to terminate its Massachusetts subsidiary. The Company considered the future realization of those net operating losses to be doubtful. During 2006, the Companys valuation allowance was increased related to the uncertain future realization of Canadian research and development credits and the increase in the state net operating loss of $51,000. 61 In 2007 and 2006, the Company generated federal and state net operating losses for income tax purposes. These federal and state net operating losses, which total approximately $914,000, expire through 2027. As of December 31, 2007, retained earnings of the Company Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries amounted to $7,470,000. No deferred taxes have been provided on these undistributed earnings, as the Companys policy is to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on these undistributed earnings. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a one-time charge to the opening balance of retained earnings amounting to $3,000 and a $3,000 increase in the Companys liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2007, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $807,000, of which $706,000 would have a favorable impact on our tax provision benefit, if recognized. A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits liability for 2007 is as follows

Balance at December 31, 2007 
$    807,000  Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007 are accrued interest and penalties in the amount of $146,000 and $84,000, respectively. The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. For federal tax returns, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2004. For foreign and state returns, the Company is no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2003. It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with the Companys unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease within the next twelve months. Based upon the closing of the tax years in these various jurisdictions, the Company may adjust its liability for unrecognized tax benefits. These changes may be the result of new examinations by taxing authorities, ongoing examinations, or the expiration of statutes of limitations. Certain of the Companys unrecognized tax benefits are related to tax years that are expected to close in 2008. Statute of limitations expirations could increase earnings in an
amount ranging from $0 to $334,000. Note O - Research and Development The Company incurred research and development costs relating to the development of new products as follows

Amortization of software development costs for 2007 included a charge to write off software development costs amounting to $520,000, which was capitalized for new products which had not reached commercial general release and were discontinued. In addition, in January 2006, the Company announced its decision to close its engineering facility in Norwood, Massachusetts. In connection with that decision, in 2005, the Company wrote off software development costs incurred at its Norwood engineering center that were capitalized for new products that had not reached commercial general release and were discontinued. This write-off amounted to $1,360,000 see Note R. Note P - Employee Benefit Plans For the Companys operations in the United States, the Companys Retirement Savings Plan qualifies under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. Discretionary matching contributions by the Company to the plan were $94,000, $95,000 and $23,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In conjunction with its flexible benefits plans, the Company made additional discretionary qualified contributions to employee accounts which vest immediately amounting to $34,000, $31,000 and $36,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For its operations in Canada, contributions were made in 2007, 2006 and 2005 to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP that is administered by the Canadian government. Discretionary matching contributions to the Plan amounted to $20,000, $21,000 and $5,000 for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Note Q - Litigation The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position of the Company. The Company issues indemnifications in the ordinary course of business with certain customers, suppliers, service providers and business partners. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are, or were, serving at the Companys request in such capacities. The fair value of the indemnifications that the Company issued during 2007 was not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note R - Restructuring Charges and Intangible Asset Write-off Restructuring charges and intangible asset write-off amounted to $393,000, $1,775,000 and $1,730,000 in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  63 Restructuring charges in 2007 principally relate to charges for the change in estimated future cash flows from sub-leasing the former San Luis Obispo engineering center and an agreement at year-end to buy out the remaining lease term for this facility, for which the future lease payments were previously accrued in 2006. The consideration for the early termination of this lease amounted to $5 million, which was paid in January 2008. Restructuring charges in 2006 primarily related to the closing of the Companys Norwood, Massachusetts engineering center, relocation of the Companys San Luis Obispo engineering center to less expensive office space and severance costs related to reductions-in-force. The relocation of the San Luis Obispo facility resulted in a charge for estimated lease termination costs amounting to $653,000. All actions under these programs were completed as of December 31, 2006, with the exception of the San Luis Obispo lease obligation.

This write-off amounted to $1,360,000. Also during 2005, the Company completed centralizing certain of its multi-location operations, including sales, marketing, accounting and manufacturing operations. The Company incurred and paid restructuring charges amounting to $370,000 in 2005 in relation to this program.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company assets; ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, and that the Company receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007, according to the criteria.  The effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on pages 40-41 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
