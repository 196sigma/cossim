REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS To the shareholders of Control Devices, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Control Devices,
Inc. an Indiana corporation and subsidiaries as of January 2, 1999 and
December 27, 1997, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended January 2, 1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Control Devices, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of January 2, 1999 and December 27, 1997, and the results of
their operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 2, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                       ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Stamford, Connecticut,

Principles of consolidation-
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated.
Fiscal year-
The Company fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending the Saturday
nearest to December 31. Fiscal 1998 was the 53 week period ending on
January 2, 1999. Fiscal 1997 and 1996 were the 52 week periods ending on
December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, respectively.
Use of estimates-
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.
Foreign currency translation and transactions-
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign operations are translated
into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet
date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate
prevailing throughout the period. The effects of exchange rate fluctuations
on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars
are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of
shareholders' equity, while gains and losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions are included in net income.

2 SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED:
Cash and cash equivalents-
Cash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with original
maturities of three months or less.
Marketable securities-
The Company investments in marketable debt securities are diversified
among high-credit quality securities in accordance with the Company
investment policy. Such investments are carried at cost which approximates
market value. There were no material unrealized gains or losses as of
January 2, 1999 or December 27, 1997. The following is a summary of the
investments in marketable debt securities which are classified as available
for sale and are included in current assets in thousands

$    5,642     $    4,980   
Trade receivables-
RDI practice is to sell part of its trade receivables to finance its
business. At January 2, 1999 and December 27, 1997, such sales with
recourse amounted to $2,742,000 and $2,595,000, respectively, which have
been deducted from trade receivables. Based on historical collectibility of
trade receivables, RDI obligations under the recourse provisions are not
material.
Inventories-
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of
inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out FIFO method of
inventory valuation.
Property, plant and equipment-
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated using
the straight-line and various accelerated methods over the estimated useful
lives of the related plant and equipment. Ranges of the estimated useful
lives are as follows         Machinery and equipment            3 to 15 years
Building and building equipment          40 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective
leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is
less. Maintenance, repairs and renewals are charged to expense as incurred;
betterments are capitalized.

2 SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES--CONTINUED:
Goodwill-
As part of the acquisitions of RDI and AEI, goodwill was recorded which
represented the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of
the identifiable underlying net assets acquired and is carried as an asset,
less accumulated amortization which is calculated on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of 40 years. The Company periodically
evaluates the periods over which intangible assets are amortized to
determine whether events have occurred which would require modification to
the amortization period. The Company reviews anticipated future operating
results and cash flows on an undiscounted basis in determining whether
there has been an impairment in the value of the excess of purchase price
over net assets acquired. An impairment loss would be measured as the
amount by which the carrying amount of the impaired asset exceeds the fair
value of the asset. That fair value would then become the asset new cost
basis. Based upon its most recent analysis, the Company believes that no
material impairment exists at January 2, 1999. Amortization charged to
operations amounted to approximately $210,000, $192,000, and $145,000, for
the years ended January 2, 1999, December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996,
respectively.
Income taxes-
The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as
set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates and
regulations.
Research and development-
Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and new product development are
expensed as incurred.
Environmental expenditures-
Environmental expenditures that relate to current or future revenues are
expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an
existing condition caused by past operations and that do not contribute to
current or future revenues are expensed.
Revenue recognition-
Revenue is recognized when products are shipped.
Comprehensive income-
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
This statement establishes rules for the reporting of comprehensive income
and its components. Comprehensive income consists of net income and foreign
currency translation adjustments and is presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Shareholders' Equity. The adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact
on total shareholders' equity. Prior year consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the SFAS 130 requirements.   Earnings per share-
In 1997, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS No.
128, and the Company reported earnings per share for the year ended
December 28, 1996 was restated. The effect of this accounting change on
previously reported earnings per share data was to increase fiscal 1996
earnings per share by less than $001 from amounts previously reported.

$  470      $ 228     
Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of the
Company foreign subsidiaries because the earnings of $6,589,000 and
$625,000 for the years ended January 2, 1999 and December 27, 1997 were
considered permanently reinvested in such foreign operations. The
unrecognized tax liability on the undistributed foreign earnings was not
significant as of January 2, 1999 and December 27, 1997.
13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:
CDI maintains a 401k savings plan for substantially all domestic
employees. Under the plan, CDI matches employee contributions subject to
the discretion of the Board of Directors. The employer contribution expense
for the years ended January 2, 1999, December 27, 1997 and December 28,
1996, was $538,000, $446,000, and $390,000, respectively. RDI maintains a
government mandated retirement plan for substantially all of its employees.
These benefits do not vest until retirement. The amount of the benefits to
be paid depends upon, among other things, the seniority and salary of the
employees at retirement date. Also, RDI maintains a government mandated
employee profit plan for all employees. The amount of the benefits are
based upon a formula which includes, among other things, net taxable
income. The liability is generally not payable for a period of five years
and is internally funded. In addition, RDI maintains an incentive plan for
certain key employees. The amount of the benefits are based upon a formula
which includes, among other things, net income. The expense for the above
plans for RDI for the years ended January 2, 1999, December 27, 1997, and
December 28, 1996 was $81,300, $28,600, and $101,000 respectively.
14 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
Operating Leases-
The Company leases certain buildings, office space, automobiles and
equipment under noncancellable operating leases expiring at various dates
through December 2002. Rental expense under operating leases amounted to
$535,000, $520,000, and $531,000, for the years ended January 2, 1999,
December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, respectively.

Operating Leases-Continued
Future minimum rental payments under leases extending for one year or more
are as follows in thousands       1999                         $328  
2000                          279  
2001                          219  
2002                          146  
2003 and thereafter                   -     Termination Benefits Agreements-
In 1998, the Company entered into Executive Separation Agreements with
Messrs. Atkinson, Wood and Hauser-Kauffmann. The Separation Agreements
provide for separation pay should a Change in Control of the Corporation
occur. The Separation Agreements were unanimously approved by the non-
employee directors. Under the Separation Agreements, the executive
employment must be terminated involuntarily other than for serious
misconduct, or voluntarily by the executive officer for good reason, i.e.
if the executive officer is demoted, relocated, or has a reduction in
compensation, for separation pay to be available. Separation pay equals
290 times the executive officer average annual compensation for the most
recent five taxable years ending before a Change in Control, and certain
benefits are also extended for three years after termination. The executive
officer is also entitled to continue to participate in the Corporation
retirement plans for three years after termination, or if such plans
prohibit continued participation after termination, to receive benefits
equal to the incremental benefit the executive officer would have received
had his employment terminated three years after the actual date of
termination. The Corporation believes that by assuring the executive
officer of some financial security, the Separation Agreements protect the
shareholders by neutralizing any bias of the executive officers in
considering proposals to acquire the Corporation. The Corporation believes
these advantages outweigh the disadvantage of the cost of the benefits.
Legal Proceedings-
The Company has various claims and contingent liabilities arising in the
ordinary conduct of business. In the opinion of management, they are not
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the
Company.

15 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
CDI-
Hammond, Kennedy, Whitney & Company, Inc. HKW provides management
services to the Company. Certain directors of the Company are principals of
HKW and own Common Shares of the Company. The Company pays HKW monthly
management fees of $15,000 and board of directors fees. These fees amounted
to $247,800, $247,200, and $246,100, for the years ended January 2, 1999,
December 27, 1997, and December 28, 1996, respectively. In addition, fees
paid to one of the principals of HKW for professional services amounted to
$36,000, $36,000, and $94,000, for the years ended January 2, 1999,
December 27, 1997, and December 28, 1996, respectively. One member of the
Company board of directors is the vice-president of the investment firm
that manages a portion of the Company short term investments.
Indemnification from Seller-
Pursuant to the terms of an Environmental Agreement dated July 6, 1994, the
Seller has retained liability and agreed to indemnify CDI for any and all
liabilities arising under CERCLA and other environmental requirements
related to contamination and cleanup at acquired facilities, treatment,
storage and disposal of hazardous materials transported offsite and
remediation required by the State of Maine Department of Environmental
Protection or U.S. Environmental Protection Agency existing or occurring
prior to the acquisition date. The Seller has indemnified CDI against
claims pursuant to the aforementioned issues to the extent the amounts
exceed $50,000 in the aggregate. The Seller has liability for claims
relating to soil and groundwater contamination from the surface impoundment
and out-of-service leachfield at the Company Standish facility, known to
exist prior to the acquisition, to the extent the liability exceeds
$50,000. The indemnifications provided by the Seller began to expire three
years after the acquisition date, with certain indemnifications continuing
indefinitely. Although the Company believes the Seller indemnity is
enforceable, if the Company were unable to enforce such indemnification
obligations against the Seller, the Company could become liable for any
such retained liability. The inability to proceed against the Seller could
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition and
results of operations.
16 SEGMENT INFORMATION:
In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131 Disclosures About Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information, which changes the way the Company
reports information about its operating segments. The Company reportable
business segments provide distinctive products and services, which are
marketed through different geographic channels. Each unit is managed
separately because of their unique geographic, marketing and distribution
requirements. The Company has two reportable business segments: CDI and
RDI. CDI designs, manufactures and markets circuit breakers, electronic
sensors and electronic ceramic component parts used by OEMs in the
automotive, appliance and telecommunications markets. CDI includes both
U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing companies involved in manufacturing,
selling and administrative functions and operations. RDI distributes CDI
products as well as a number of electronic components in Europe such as
capacitors, connectors, circuit protection devices produced by other
manufacturers and various electronic fuses and aftermarket products. These
components are supplied to the automotive, appliance, and telecommunication
OEM markets and are sourced and stocked by RDI. The Company accounting
policies for segments are the same as those described in the summary of
accounting policies. Management evaluates segment performance based on
segment net income. Transfers between segments are accounted for at market
value.

$9,469,000 excluding intercompany sales of $6,359,000 to RDI ,
$8,218,000 excluding intercompany sales of $4,689,000 to RDI , and
$8,765,000 excluding intercompany sales of $2,764,000 to RDI ,
respectively. Sales to RDI are made on substantially the same terms
and conditions as those to unrelated customers.
17   CUSTOMER INFORMATION:
CDI sells products primarily to OEMs on a worldwide basis, primarily
in the automotive, appliance and telecommunications industries. RDI
distributes its products primarily to OEMs in the Northern European
market. Sales are concentrated in North America and Europe with the
top 15 customers accounting for approximately 55%, 50%, and 45% of
sales in 1998, 1997, and 1996 respectively. For the years ended
January 2, 1999, December 27, 1997, and December 28, 1996, one
customer accounted for approximately $12,911,500, $9,955,700, and
$7,075,000 of sales during these periods.
F-25
18   SUPPLIER INFORMATION:
The Company relies on a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers
for certain key components of its products. The Company does not have
a long-term supply agreement with any of these suppliers, and operates
under purchase orders. The Company reliance on sole or a limited
group of suppliers involves several risks, including a potential
inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and
reduced control over pricing and timely delivery of components.
Although the timeliness, yield and quality of deliveries to date from
the Company suppliers have been acceptable, any prolonged inability
to obtain adequate deliveries or any other circumstances that would
require the Company to seek alternative sources of supply could delay
the Company ability to ship its products, which could damage
relationships with current and prospective customers and could,
therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations. 19   CONSULTING AGREEMENTS:
In April 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with an
individual to provide design, marketing and consulting services to the
Company. In addition, the Company entered into a number of license
agreements with this individual. The terms of these agreements provide
for minimum cash royalty and license payments. In connection with
these agreements, the Company paid the individual a one time payment
of $200,000 in 1995 and granted a non-qualified stock option to
purchase up to 333,332 Common Shares at any time until March 31, 2002
at $540 per Common Share. In addition, royalty payments were
approximately $520,000, $334,000, and $247,000 for the years ended
January 2, 1999, December 27, 1997, and December 28, 1996,
respectively.
On December 27, 1998 the Company and the individual entered into an
additional license agreement which provides for minimum cash royalty
payments. On December 28, 1998 the individual and the Company
terminated the consulting services agreement signed in April of 1995
and amended the license agreements to reduce the minimum cash royalty
and license payments on certain products. In connection with the
termination of the consulting services agreement, the Company paid the
individual a one time payment of $635,553, which is included in
selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal 1998 in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. 20   INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION:
The Company has an international manufacturing subsidiary located in
San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. Included in the Company balance
sheet at January 2, 1999, and December 27, 1997, are the net assets of
the Company international manufacturing operations which totaled
approximately $1,785,000 and $2,017,000, respectively. This operation
manufactured products accounting for approximately 33% and 34% of the
Company gross revenues in fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997, respectively.
RDI distributes its products primarily to automotive OEMs in Northern
Europe. The Company results of operations are therefore subject to
European economic conditions. RDI generates revenues and incurs
expenses primarily in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a
result, there is increased financial risk to the Company based on
fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates,
therefore, may have a significant effect on the Company financial
condition and results of operations. At January 2, 1999 and December
27, 1997, the net assets of RDI, including goodwill, were
approximately $140 million and $97 million.
