REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of
Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income loss, cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in a2. These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries at December
31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Stoneridge, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework and our report dated March 13,

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated 1. Organization and Nature of Business Stoneridge, Inc. and its subsidiaries are global designers and manufacturers
of highly engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems for the automotive, commercial, motorcycle, off-highway
and agricultural vehicle markets. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Stoneridge, Inc. and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries collectively, the Company. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company analyzes its ownership interests in accordance with
Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 810 Consolidations to determine whether they are VIEs and,
if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Companys investment in Minda Stoneridge Instruments Ltd.
Minda at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was determined to be an unconsolidated entity and was accounted for under
the equity method of accounting based on our 49% noncontrolling interest. On December 31, 2011, the Company completed the acquisition of an
additional 24% controlling interest in PST Eletrnica Ltda. PST increasing its ownership to 74% of the outstanding
equity of PST. As a result, PST became a consolidated subsidiary and its results of operations were included in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income loss and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and
2012. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company entered into an asset
purchase agreement to divest its Wiring business including substantially all of its assets and liabilities. The sale was completed
on August 1, 2014. The Wiring business has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated
financial statements. Accordingly, the Wiring business is excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all
periods presented. All previously reported financial information has been revised to conform to the current presentation. The Wiring
business designed and manufactured wiring harness products and assembled instruments panels for sale principally to the commercial,
agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets. Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, including certain self-insured risks and liabilities, disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Because actual results could differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions
as new information becomes available. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Companys cash and cash equivalents are actively traded
money market funds with short-term investments in marketable securities, primarily U.S. government securities. Cash and cash equivalents
are stated at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the highly liquid nature and short-term duration of the underlying securities. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk Revenues are principally generated from the automotive, commercial,
motorcycle, off-highway and agricultural vehicle markets. The Companys largest customers were Ford Motor Company and Scania
Group, primarily related to the Control Devices and Electronics reportable segments, respectively, and accounted for the following
percentages of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice price, net of an
estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts and other reserves. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable
based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet
its financial obligations, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized
receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected. Additionally, the Company reviews historical trends
for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts. If economic circumstances change substantially,
estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the Company could be reduced by a material amount. The Company does not have
collateral requirements with its customers. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost using either the first-in,
first-out FIFO or average cost methods or market. The Company evaluates and adjusts as necessary its excess and
obsolescence reserve on a quarterly basis. Excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for
a reasonable period. The Company has guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months
of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage. Management uses its judgment to forecast sales or usage and to determine
what constitutes a reasonable period. Inventory cost includes material, labor and overhead. Inventories consist of the following   As of December 31

December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Inventory valued using the average cost method was $36,617 and $46,308 at December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. Pre-production Costs Related to Long-term Supply Arrangements Engineering, research and development and other design and development
costs for products sold on long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred unless the Company has a contractual guarantee
for reimbursement from the customer. Costs for molds, dies and other tools used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements
for which the Company either has title to the assets or has the noncancelable right to use the assets during the term of the supply
arrangement are capitalized in property, plant and equipment and amortized to cost of sales over the shorter of the term of the
arrangement or over the estimated useful lives of the assets, typically three to five years. Costs for molds, dies and other tools
used to make products sold on long-term supply arrangements for which the Company has a contractual guarantee to a lump sum reimbursement
from the customer are capitalized as a component of prepaid expenses and other current assets within the consolidated balance sheets.
The amounts recorded related to these pre-production costs as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $10,067 and $11,584 respectively. Discontinued Operations Wiring Business On May 26, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement
to sell substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the former Wiring segment to Motherson Sumi Systems Ltd., an India-based
manufacturer of diversified products for the global automotive industry and a limited company incorporated under the laws of the
Republic of India, and MSSL GB LIMITED, a limited company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom collectively, Motherson,
for $65,700 in cash and the assumption of certain related liabilities of the Wiring business. On August 1, 2014, the Company completed the sale of
substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its Wiring business to Motherson for $71,386 in cash that consisted of the
stated purchase price and estimated working capital on the closing date. The final purchase price is subject to post-closing
working capital and other adjustments, which impacts the loss on disposal recorded in discontinued operations. The disputed
items regarding the working capital and other adjustments that have not been amicably resolved between
the Company and Motherson are being determined by an independent accountant in accordance with the asset purchase
agreement.   44
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated The Company recorded a loss on disposal, net of tax of $8,576 for
the year ended December 31, 2014 which included the recognition of previously deferred foreign currency translation of $2,734,
income tax on the sale of Wirings Mexican businesses of $1,621 and transaction costs of $1,384. The loss on disposal increased
by $795 from the previously reported amount as of September 30, 2014 primarily due to adjustments related to working capital and
other adjustments as well as additional transaction costs. The Company also entered into short-term transition services agreements
with Motherson expected to conclude in the first quarter of 2015 associated with information systems, accounting, administrative,
occupancy and support services as well as contract manufacturing and production support in Estonia. The Companys Electronics segment had post-disposition sales
August 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014 to the Wiring business acquired by Motherson of $12,230 for the five months ended December
31, 2014. Post-disposition purchases by the Companys Electronics segment from the Wiring business acquired by Motherson
were $269 for the five months ended December 31, 2014. The following tables display summarized activity in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, related

and major renewals are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss on the disposition is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations
as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Impairment of Long-Lived or Finite-Lived Assets The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets
and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Factors the Company considers important that could trigger testing of the related asset groups for an impairment include current
period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses, significant adverse changes in the business climate within a particular business or current expectations that
a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. To test for
impairment, the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and disposal of the asset or asset group
is compared to its carrying value. An asset group is established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by the
group of assets that are largely independent of cash flows of other assets. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently
identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify
projected cash flows. If these undiscounted cash flows are less than their respective carrying values, an impairment charge would
be recognized to the extent that the carrying values exceed estimated fair values. The estimation of undiscounted cash flows and
fair value requires us to make assumptions regarding future operating results. The results of the impairment testing are dependent
on these estimates which require judgment. The occurrence of certain events, including changes in economic and competitive conditions,
could impact cash flows eventually realized and managements ability to accurately assess whether an asset is impaired.   47

in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated Due to the impairment of the PST goodwill in 2014, the Company performed
an evaluation of PSTs long-lived assets and concluded that there was no impairment resulting from the lower forecasted undiscounted
future cash flows. There we no material impairment charges recorded for long-lived
or finite-lived intangible assets in 2014, 2013 or 2012. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill The total purchase price associated with acquisitions is allocated
to the acquisition date fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the excess purchase price assigned
to goodwill. Goodwill is subject to an annual assessment for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by
applying a fair value-based test. The Company recorded goodwill related to the acquisition of controlling
interest in PST in 2011, all of which was deemed to be impaired in 2014. The remaining goodwill balance at December 31, 2014 relates
to the acquisition of two European aftermarket distributors, which is included within the Electronics segment. Goodwill and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment

$1,078 The Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test for its
majority owned subsidiary, PST Eletrnica Ltda. PST on October 1, 2013 without a need to expand the impairment
test to step two of ASC 350 as PSTs calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%
and no indicators of impairment were identified as disclosed in the Companys 2013 Form 10-K. During the second quarter of 2014, however, indicators of potential
impairment required the Company to conduct an interim impairment test. Those indicators included a decline in recent operating
results and lower growth expectations primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian economy and automotive market. In accordance
with ASC 350, the Company completed step one of the impairment analysis and concluded that, as of June 30, 2014,
the fair value of the PST reportable segment was below its carrying value, including goodwill. As a result, step two
of the impairment test was initiated in accordance with ASC 350. The Company recorded its best estimate of $29,300 as a non-cash
goodwill impairment charge of which $6,436 was attributable to noncontrolling interest as of June 30, 2014. Based on the Companys
completed step two analysis in the third quarter of 2014, the final goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2014 was $23,498
of which $5,162 was attributable to noncontrolling interest. As such, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce the goodwill
impairment by $5,802 of which $1,274 was attributable to noncontrolling interest as of September 30, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company conducted its annual
goodwill impairment test for PST and completed step one of the impairment test concluding that as of October 1, 2014
the fair value of the PST reportable segment was less than its carrying value, including goodwill. PSTs fair value decreased
further due to significantly lower sales and earnings growth expectations which were a result of lower forecasted growth in the
Brazilian economy and automotive market and a forecasted decline in currency exchange rates thereby increasing PSTs material
costs. Based on the completed step two analysis, a goodwill impairment charge of $27,960 of which $6,142 was attributable
to noncontrolling interest was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 which represented all of the remaining PST goodwill. The
aggregate goodwill impairment for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $51,458 of which $11,304 was attributable to noncontrolling
interest.   48
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated The fair value measurement of the reporting unit under the step
one analysis and the step two analysis a non-recurring fair value measure in their entirety are classified
as Level 3 inputs. The estimates and assumptions underlying the fair value calculations used in the Company impairment test are
uncertain by their nature and can vary significantly from actual results. Factors that management must estimate include, but are
not limited to, industry and market conditions, sales volume and pricing, raw material costs, capital expenditures, working capital
changes, cost of capital, debt-equity mix and tax rates. The estimates and assumptions that most significantly affect the fair
value calculation are sales volume and the associated cash flow assumptions, market growth and weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with those the Company uses in its internal planning. The step two of the PST goodwill impairment test utilized
the following methodologies in determining fair value. Buildings and machinery were valued at an estimated replacement cost for
an asset of comparable age and condition. PST finite lived identified intangible assets are customer relationships, tradenames
and technology. Customer relationships were valued using an excess earnings method, using various inputs such as the estimated
customer attrition rate, future earnings forecast, the amount of contributory asset charges, and a discount rate. Tradenames and
technology intangibles are valued using a relief from royalty method, which is based upon comparable market royalty rates for tradenames
of similar value. Other working capital items are generally recorded at carrying value, unless there were known conditions that
would impact the ultimate settlement amount of a particular item. The Companys accumulated goodwill impairment loss was $300,083
and $248,625 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to PSTs 2014 goodwill impairment, the accumulated
goodwill impairment loss includes the goodwill impairment recorded by the Companys Control Devices segment in 2008 and 2004. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets, net at December 31, 2014 and 2013 consisted

Deferred income taxes reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more
likely than not to occur. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period
that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that these assets
are more likely than not to be realized See Note 5. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive
and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax
planning strategies, and results of recent operations. Reversal of some or all of the U.S. valuation allowance would result in
the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the reversal is recorded. The Company policy is to provide for uncertain tax positions and
the related interest and penalties based upon management assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained
upon examination by tax authorities. At December 31, 2014, the Company believes it has appropriately accounted for any unrecognized
tax benefits see Note 5. To the extent the Company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit
is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability, the Company effective tax rate in a given financial
statement period may be affected. Currency Translation The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, where the local
currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the period end for assets
and liabilities and average exchange rates during each reporting period for the results of operations. Adjustments resulting from
translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Companys
consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency transactions are remeasured into the functional
currency using translation rates in effect at the time of the transaction with the resulting adjustments included on the consolidated
statements of operations within other expense, net. These foreign currency transaction losses, including the impact of hedging
activities, were $1,212, $2,109 and $3,979 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Sales Commitments The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products, net of
actual and estimated returns, at the point of passage of title, which is either at the time of shipment or upon customer receipt
based upon the terms of the sale. The Company collects certain taxes and fees on behalf of government agencies and remits such
collections on a periodic basis. The taxes are collected from customers but are not included in net sales. Estimated returns are
based on historical authorized returns. The Company often enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given
vehicles expected production life. Once such agreements are entered into, it is the Companys obligation to fulfill
the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle. These agreements are subject to potential
renegotiation from time to time, which may affect product pricing.   50

the consolidated statements of operations. Product Warranty and Recall Reserves Amounts accrued for product warranty and recall claims are established
based on the Companys best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of
the balance sheet dates. These accruals are based on several factors including past experience, production changes, industry developments
and various other considerations. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future
or that it will not incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims beyond the amounts accrued or beyond what the Company
may recover from its suppliers. The current portion of the product warranty and recall reserve is included as a component of accrued
expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Product warranty and recall includes $1,204 and $1,019
of a long-term liability at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which is included as a component of other long-term liabilities

years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, or 63%, 61% and 64% of net sales for these respective periods. Research and Development Activities The Company enters into research and development contracts with
certain customers, which generally provide for reimbursement of costs. The Company incurred and was reimbursed for contracted research
and development costs of $12,319, $16,982 and $16,369 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Share-Based Compensation At December 31, 2014, the Company had two types of share-based compensation
plans: 1 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, for employees and 2 the Amended Directors Restricted Shares Plan, for
non-employee directors. The Long-Term Incentive Plan is madeupofthe Long-Term Incentive Plan that was approved
bythe Companyshareholders on September 30, 1997, whichexpired on June 30, 2007, and the Amended and Restated
Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended, that was approved by shareholders on May 17, 2010,and expires on April 24, 2016. Total compensation expense recognized as a component of selling,
general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations for share-based compensation arrangements was $5,406 4,974 and $4,890 for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Of these amounts, $243, $155 and $47 for

indicated Financial Instruments and Derivative Financial Instruments Financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,
held by the Company include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt, an interest rate
swap, fixed price commodity contracts and foreign currency forward contracts. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable is considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these
instruments. See Note 9 for fair value disclosures of the Companys financial instruments. Common Shares Held in Treasury The Company accounts for Common Shares held in treasury under the
cost method and includes such shares as a reduction of total shareholders equity. Earnings Loss Per Share Basic earnings loss per share was computed by dividing net income
by the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding for each respective period.Diluted earnings loss per share
was calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to Stoneridge, Inc. by the weighted-average of all potentially dilutive
Common Shares that were outstanding during the periods presented. However, for all periods in which the Company recognized
a net loss from continuing operations, the Company did not recognize the effect of the potential dilutive securities as their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive. Actual weighted-average Common Shares outstanding used in calculating

not included in the computation of diluted net income per share to purchase 20,000 and 59,000 Common Shares at an average price
of $1573 and $1220 per share were outstanding at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These outstanding options were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their respective exercise prices were greater than the average
closing market price of Company Common Shares and the effect would be anti-dilutive. There were 466,650, 663,750 and 635,850 performance-based restricted
Common Shares outstanding at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. There were also 374,400 performance-based right to
receive Common Shares outstanding at December 31, 2014. These restricted and right to receive Common Shares were not included in
the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012 as the Company had a net loss from
continuing operations for 2014 and 2012, and as such they would be anti-dilutive. These performance-based shares were not included
in the computation of diluted net income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 because all performance-based vesting conditions
were not achieved. Certain of these shares may be dilutive based on the Companys ability to achieve future performance targets. Deferred Finance Costs Deferred finance costs are amortized over the life of the related
financial instrument using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The 25% discount to the
initial purchasers of the Companys senior secured notes was accreted using the effective interest rate of 100% through
October 18, 2014, the date the senior notes were redeemed. During 2014, the Company redeemed the senior secured notes resulting
in the acceleration of the remaining deferred financing costs of $597 which were included in loss on early extinguishment of debt
in the statement of operations in 2014. Deferred finance cost amortization and debt discount accretion for the years ended December
31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $850, $908 and $855, respectively, and is included as a component of interest expense, net on the consolidated
statements of operations. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, deferred financing costs, net were $1,767 and $1,168, respectively

$30,458 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted as of December
31, 2014 In January 2015, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued accounting standard update
ASU 2015 01 Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items Subtopic 225-20 that
eliminates the concept of extraordinary items and their segregation from the results of ordinary operations and expands presentation
and disclosure guidance to include items that are both unusual in nature and occur infrequently. The new accounting standard is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will adopt as of January 1, 2016. The new
accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or disclosures. In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014
12 Stock Compensation - Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance
Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period that requires performance targets that could be achieved after
the requisite service period be treated as performance conditions that affect the vesting of the award. The new accounting
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company will adopt as of January1,2016
which is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures. In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606, which is the new comprehensive
revenue recognition standard that will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard core principle
is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle,
an entity identifies the contract with a customer, identifies the separate performance obligations in the contract, determines
the transaction price, allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations and recognizes revenue when each
separate performance obligation is satisfied. This ASU is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is not permitted. As such, the Company will adopt this
standard in the first quarter of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on
its consolidated financial statements.   53

indicated Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation
of Financial Statements Topic 205 and Property, Plant, and Equipment Topic 360, which amends the definition of a discontinued
operation in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-20 and requires entities to provide additional disclosures
about discontinued operations as well as disposal transactions that do not meet the discontinued-operations criteria. The new standard
changes the definition of a discontinued operation and requires discontinued operations treatment for disposals of a component
or group of components that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on an entitys operations or
financial results. This ASU is effective prospectively for all disposals except disposals classified as held for sale before the
adoption date or components initially classified as held for sale in periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption
is permitted. The Company adopted this ASU in May 2014 and has applied it prospectively to new disposals and new classifications
of disposal groups as held for sale including the Wiring business. In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes
Topic 740, which requires entities to present in the financial statements an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of
an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or
a tax credit carryforward except to the extent such items are not available or not intended to be used at the reporting date to
settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. In such instances, the unrecognized
tax benefit is required to be presented in the financial statements as a liability and not be combined with deferred tax assets.
This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013. This ASU was adopted on January 1, 2014 which did not
have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 3. Investments Minda Stoneridge Instruments Ltd. The Company has a 49% interest in Minda, a company based in India

taxes for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in tax expense for the year ended December
31, 2014 compared to the same period for 2013 was predominantly due to the tax benefit of the loss incurred by PST, as adjusted
for the non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $51,458. The decrease in the tax expense was partially offset by discrete
tax items related to certain foreign operations recorded during the current period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for
2014 to 35% compared to the same period for 2013 of 120% was due to the recognition of a tax benefit on the PST operating
loss which was offset by the impact of the non-tax deductible PST goodwill impairment and the discrete tax items discussed above.   57
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because of managements intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest such earnings.
At December 31, 2014 the aggregate undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $31,043. The Company may be
subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if these earnings were distributed. It is not practicable to estimate
the amount of taxes, if any, that may be payable on these earnings as that estimate depends upon circumstances that would exist
at the time a remittance occurs. Significant components of the Companys deferred

$51,239 The Company has concluded based on objective evidence that
at December 31, 2014 and 2013 it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not be generated to utilize the remaining
U.S. federal, and certain state and foreign, deferred tax assets before they expire and as such a valuation allowance has been
recorded. The valuation allowance represents the amount of tax benefit related to U.S. federal, state and foreign net operating
losses, credits and other deferred tax assets that are not recognized at December 31, 2014. The Company has net operating loss carry forwards of $113,901 101,722 and $19,887 for U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions, respectively. The U.S. federal net operating losses,
if unused, begin to expire in December 31, 2025, the state net operating losses expire at various times and the foreign net operating
losses expire at various times or have indefinite expiration dates. The Company has general business and foreign tax credit carry
forwards of $13,060, $1,991 and $1,175 for U.S. federal, state and foreign jurisdictions respectively. The U.S. federal general
business credits, if unused, begin to expire in December 31, 2021, and the state and foreign tax credits expire at various times. The Company is required to provide a deferred tax liability
corresponding to the difference between the financial reporting basis which was remeasured to fair value upon the acquisition
of an additional 24% of PST in 2011 and the tax basis in the previously held 50% ownership interest in PST the outside
basis difference. This outside basis difference will generally remain fixed until 1 dividends from the subsidiary exceed the
parents share of earnings subsequent to the date it became a subsidiary or 2 there is a transaction that affects the
Companys ownership of PST.   58

$3,416 At December 31, 2014 the Company has classified $719 as a noncurrent
liability and $3,299 as a reduction to non-current deferred income tax assets. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not
expected to change significantly during the next 12 months. Management is currently unaware of issues under review that could
result in a significant change or a material deviation in this estimate. If the Companys tax positions are sustained by the taxing
authorities in favor of the Company, the amounts that would affect the Companys effective tax rate are approximately $3,851
and $3,547 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Consistent with historical financial reporting, the Company
has elected to classify interest expense and, if applicable, penalties which could be assessed related to unrecognized tax benefits
as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized expense benefit
of approximately $411, $82 and $64 of gross interest and penalties, respectively. The Company has accrued approximately $213
and $624 for the payment of interest and penalties at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business
the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The following table summarizes the open tax

of both outstanding and exercisable options was $0. Restricted Shares The fair value of the non-vested time-based restricted Common
Share awards was calculated using the market value of the Common Shares on the date of issuance. The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of time-based restricted Common Shares granted during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $1154 613 and $995, respectively. The fair value of the non-vested performance-based restricted
Common Share awards with a performance condition requiring the Company to obtain certain earnings per share targets was estimated
using the market value of the shares on the date of grant. The fair value of non-vested performance-based restricted Common Share
awards with a market condition requiring the Company to obtain a total shareholder return target relative to a group of peer companies
was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model taking into consideration the probability of achievement using multiple simulations.   61

2014, 2013 and 2012, the total fair value of time-based restricted Common Share and right to receive Common Share awards vested
was $3,509, $2,177 and $4,413, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, total unrecognized
compensation cost related to non-vested performance-based restricted Common Share and right to receive Common Share awards granted
was $1,713 for shares probable to vest. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 133 years dependent
upon the achievement of performance conditions. As noted above, the Company has issued and outstanding performance-based restricted
Common Share awards that use different performance targets. The awards that use earnings per share as the performance target will
not be expensed until it is probable that the Company will meet the underlying performance condition. There was no cash received from option exercises under any
share-based payment arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. There was no actual tax benefit realized
for the tax deductions from the vesting of restricted Common Shares and option exercises of the share-based payment arrangements
for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. 8. Employee Benefit Plans The Company has certain defined contribution
profit sharing and 401k plans covering substantially all of its employees in the United States and United Kingdom. The Company
provides matching contributions to the Companys 401k plan. Company contributions are generally discretionary. The Companys
policy is to fund all benefit costs accrued. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, expenses related to these plans
amounted to $1,280, $1,173 and $1,122, respectively. Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan In March 2009, the Company adopted the Stoneridge,
Inc. Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP and granted awards to certain officers and key employees. Awards under
the LTCIP provided recipients with the right to receive cash three years from the date of grant depending on the Companys
actual earnings per share performance for the defined performance period. If the participant voluntarily terminated employment
or was discharged for cause, as defined in the LTCIP, the award would be forfeited. In May 2009, the LTCIP was approved by the
Companys shareholders. The Company granted Phantom Share awards
in 2013 that vest in February 2016 depending on the Companys actual earnings per share performance for each fiscal year
of 2013, 2014 and 2015 within the performance period. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has recorded a liability of $245 for
the awards granted under the LTCIP which was included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of other long-term liabilities.
There were no awards granted under the LTCIP during the year ended December 31, 2014 or 2012.   62

Measurements Financial Instruments A financial instrument is cash or a contract that imposes an
obligation to deliver, or conveys a right to receive cash or another financial instrument. The carrying values of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity
of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Companys senior secured notes with a face value of $175,000 fixed
rate debt at December 31, 2013 was $190,100, and was determined using market quotes classified as Level 2 input within the fair
value hierarchy. The Company redeemed all of the senior secured notes during 2014. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities On December 31, 2014, the Company had open foreign currency
forward contracts and fixed price commodity contracts. These contracts are used solely for hedging and not for speculative purposes.
Management believes that its use of these instruments to reduce risk is in the Companys best interest. The counterparties
to these financial instruments are financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk The Company conducts business internationally and therefore
is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. The Company uses derivative financial instruments as cash flow and fair value
hedges to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on
foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions, inventory purchases and other foreign currency exposures. The foreign
currencies hedged by the Company during 2014 and 2013 include the euro and Mexican peso. In certain instances, the foreign currency forward contracts
do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market, with gains and losses recognized in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations as a component of other expense, net. These forward contracts were executed to hedge forecasted transactions
and were accounted for as cash flow hedges. As such, the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss was deferred and reported
in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The cash flow hedges
were highly effective. The effectiveness of the transactions has been and will be measured on an ongoing basis using regression
analysis and forecasted future purchases of the euro, Swedish krona and Mexican peso. The Companys foreign currency forward contracts are
designed to offset some of the gains and losses realized on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions as follows Euro-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company held a foreign currency
forward contract with an underlying notional amount of $3,523 and $13,335, respectively, to reduce the exposure related to the
Companys euro-denominated intercompany loans. This contract expires in March 2015. The euro-denominated foreign currency
forward contract was not designated as a hedging instrument. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recognized a gain
of $1,205 in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other expense, net related to the euro-denominated contract.
For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Company recognized a loss of $638 and $492, respectively, related to foreign
currency forward contracts. U.S. dollar-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
Cash Flow Hedge The Company entered into on behalf of one of its European Electronics
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro, U.S. dollar-denominated currency contracts with a notional amount at December
31, 2014 of $4,266 which expires ratably on a monthly basis from January 2015 through December 2015, compared to $0 at December
31, 2013.   63
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated The Company entered into on behalf of one of its European Electronics
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Swedish krona, U.S. dollar-denominated currency contracts with a notional amount
at December 31, 2014 of $11,718 which expires ratably on a monthly basis from January 2015 through December 2015, compared to
$0 at December 31, 2013. Mexican peso-denominated Foreign Currency Forward Contracts
Cash Flow Hedge The Company holds Mexican peso-denominated foreign currency
contracts with notional amounts at December 31, 2014 of $10,282 which expire ratably on a monthly basis from January 2015 through
December 2015, compared to $45,000 at December 31, 2013. As a result of the sale of the Wiring business, the Company
forecasted that it would purchase Mexican pesos to fulfill only two of the five hedge contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2014
for the period October 2014 through December 2014. As the purchase of Mexican pesos related to three of the five hedge contracts
was not probable, these three hedges attributed to the Wiring business were de-designated as of June 30, 2014 and the associated
unrecognized $320 gain at that date was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in discontinued operations
in the Companys consolidated statements of operations in the quarter and year of de-designation. On August 4, 2014, the
three de-designated hedges were terminated and settled resulting in a nominal gain. Commodity Price Risk - Cash Flow Hedge To mitigate the risk of future price volatility and, consequently,
fluctuations in gross margins, the Company entered into fixed price commodity contracts with a financial institution to fix the
cost of a portion of the Companys copper purchases as copper is a raw material used in the Companys products. The Company has fixed price commodity contracts at December
31, 2014 with an aggregate notional amount of 317 pounds, which expire on a monthly basis over the period from January through
March 2015, compared to an aggregate notional amount of 1,582 pounds at December 31, 2013. All of these contracts represented
a portion of the Companys forecasted copper purchases when they were entered into. These contracts were executed to hedge
a portion of forecasted transactions, except for the 317 pounds outstanding at December 31, 2014, and have been designated and
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The unrealized gain or loss for the effective portion of the
hedges is deferred and reported in the Companys condensed consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss while the ineffective portion, if any, is reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The effectiveness of the transactions is measured on an ongoing basis using regression analysis and forecasted future copper purchases.
Based upon the results of the regression analysis, the Company has concluded that these cash flow hedges are highly effective. The Company evaluated the effectiveness of the copper fixed
price commodity contracts at each reporting date in 2014. As a result of the sale of the Wiring business, the Company forecasted
that it would not purchase the quantities of copper to fulfill these hedge contracts for the period January 2015 through March
2015. As the purchase of copper quantities related to these hedge contracts was not probable, the contracts primarily associated
with the Wiring segment not expected to be fulfilled were de-designated at June 30, 2014 with the associated unrecognized $77
gain reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded in discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated
statements of operations in the quarter and year of de-designation. Interest Rate Risk - Fair Value Hedge The Company had a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreement
the Swap with a notional amount of $45,000 to hedge its exposure to fair value fluctuations on a portion of its
senior secured notes. The Swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under the Companys
$175,000 95% senior secured notes due October 15, 2017. The critical terms of the Swap were aligned with the terms of the senior
secured notes, including maturity of October 15, 2017, resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness. The unrealized gain or loss for
the effective portion of the hedge was deferred and reported in the Companys consolidated balance sheets as an asset or
liability, as applicable, with the offset to the carrying value of the senior secured notes. Under the Swap, the Company paid a variable interest rate equal
to the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus 72% and it received a fixed interest rate of 95%.
The Swap required semi-annual settlements on April 15 and October 15. The difference between amounts received and paid under the
Swap was recognized as a component of interest expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations.   64

to access at the measurement date. The Company did not have any fair value estimates using Level 1 inputs at December 31,
2014 or 2013.
B
Fair values estimated using Level 2 inputs, other
than quoted prices, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly and include among other
things, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in markets that are active or inactive as well as inputs other than
quoted prices that are observable. For forward currency, fixed price commodity and interest rate swap contracts, inputs include
foreign currency exchange rates, commodity indexes and the six-month forward LIBOR.
C
Fair values estimated using Level 3 inputs consist
of significant unobservable inputs. The Company did not have any recurring fair value estimates using Level 3 inputs at December
31, 2014 or 2013. The Company recorded a non-recurring fair value adjustment
of $51,458 related to the PST goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company utilized Level 3 inputs to estimate
the fair value adjustment for nonfinancial assets. For additional information, see the discussion of Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets in Note 2. No adjustments to fair value were required for nonfinancial assets for the years ended December 31, 2013 or
2012. 10. Commitments and Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject
to a broad range of claims and legal proceedings that relate to contractual allegations, tax audits, patent infringement, product
liability, employment-related matters and environmental matters.Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the
outcome of these matters, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.   66
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
in thousands, except share and per share data, unless otherwise
indicated As a result of environmental studies performed at the Companys
former facility located in Sarasota, Florida, the Company became aware of soil and groundwater contamination at the Company site.
The Company engaged an environmental engineering consultant to assess the level of contamination and to develop a remediation
and monitoring plan for the site. Soil remediation at the site was completed during the year ended December 31, 2010. Ground water
remediation will begin in the first quarter of 2015, as the remedial action plan has been approved by the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, environmental remediation costs incurred were
immaterial. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had accrued an undiscounted liability of $876 and $944, respectively, related
to future remediation. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, $813 and $683, respectively, were recorded as a component of accrued expenses
and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets while the remaining amounts were recorded as a component of other
long-term liabilities. A majority of the costs associated with the recorded liability will be incurred at the start of the groundwater
remediation, with the balance relating to monitoring costs to be incurred over multiple years. The recorded liability is based
on assumptions in the remedial action plan. Although the Company sold the Sarasota facility in December 2011, the liability to
remediate the site contamination remains the responsibility of the Company. Due to the ongoing site remediation, the closing terms
of the sale agreement included a requirement for the Company to maintain a $2,000 letter of credit for the benefit of the buyer. In September 2013, a legal proceeding was initiated by Actia
Automotive Actia in a French court the tribunal de grande instance de Paris alleging infringement of its patents
by the Companys Electronics segment. The euro and U.S. dollar equivalent $ that
Actia is seeking is 14,000 $16,937 for injunctive relief and monetary damages resulting from such alleged infringement.
The Company believes that its products did not infringe on any of the patents claimed by Actia, and the claim is without merit.
Therefore it is vigorously defending itself against these allegations. The Company believes the likelihood of loss is not probable.
As such, no liability has been recorded for this claim. There have been no significant changes to the facts and circumstances
related to this claim during the year ended December 31, 2014. On May 24, 2013, the State Revenue Services of So Paulo
issued a tax deficiency notice against PST claiming that the vehicle tracking and monitoring services it provides should be classified
as communication services, and therefore subject to the State Value Added Tax ICMS. The State Revenue Services assessment
imposed the 250% ICMS tax on all revenues of PST related to the vehicle tracking and monitoring services during the period from
January 2009 through December 2010. The Brazilian real R$ and U.S. dollar equivalent $ of the
aggregate tax assessment is approximately R$92,500 $34,800 which is comprised of Value Added Tax ICMS of R$13,200 $5,000,
interest of R$11,400 $4,300 and penalties of R$67,900 $25,500. The Company believes that the vehicle tracking and monitoring
services are non-communication services, as defined under Brazilian tax law, subject to the municipal ISS tax, not communication
services subject to state ICMS tax as claimed by the State Revenue Services of So Paulo. PST has, and will continue to
collect the municipal ISS tax on the vehicle tracking and monitoring services in compliance with Brazilian tax law and will defend
its tax position. PST has received a legal opinion that the merits of the case are favorable to PST, determining among other things
that the imposition on the subsidiary of the State ICMS by the State Revenue Services of So Paulo is not in accordance
with the Brazilian tax code. Management believes, based on the legal opinion of the Companys Brazilian legal counsel and
the results of the Brazil Administrative Court ruling in favor of another vehicle tracking and monitoring company related to
the tax deficiency notice it received, the likelihood of loss is not probable although it may take years to resolve. As
a result of the above, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, no accrual has been recorded with respect to this tax assessment.
An unfavorable judgment on this issue for the years assessed and for subsequent years could result in significant costs to PST
and adversely affect its results of operations. There have been no significant changes to the facts and circumstances related
to this notice for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, PST has civil, labor and other tax contingencies
for which the likelihood of loss is deemed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, by the Companys legal advisors
in Brazil. As a result, no provision has been recorded with respect to these contingencies, which amount to R$37,237 $14,019
and R$26,867 $11,469 at December, 2014 and 2013, respectively. An unfavorable outcome on these contingencies could result in
significant cost to PST and adversely affect its results of operations. 11. Restructuring On October 29, 2007, the Company announced a restructuring
initiative to improve manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at its Mitcheldean, United
Kingdom Electronics reportable segment location. During 2008 and 2009, in response to the depressed conditions in the European
commercial and automotive vehicle markets, the Company continued and expanded the restructuring initiatives in the Electronics
reportable segment. In 2010, the Company continued restructuring initiatives within the Electronics reportable segment and recorded
amounts related to its terminated property lease in Mitcheldean, United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2012, the Company
finalized a settlement agreement to modify the terms of and the obligation associated with the property consistent with previous
estimates.   67

the Company recorded lease related restructuring charges during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 of $494, $469
and $256, respectively, as part of selling, general and administrative expense. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the only remaining
restructuring related accrual relates to the terminated property lease in Mitcheldean, United Kingdom, for which the Company has
accrued $733 and $780, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets of which $402 and $427, respectively, is a component of

incurred and paid business realignment charges of $1,578 for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $847 was recorded in cost
of goods sold, $559 in selling, general and administrative expenses and the remainder in design and development costs. The charges
consist primarily of severance costs related to workforce reductions. There were no restructuring expenses related to the PST
segment during the year ended December 31, 2013. Business realignment charges were $1,646 for the year ended December 31, 2012,
of which $729 was recorded in cost of goods sold, $579 in selling, general and administrative expenses and the remainder in design
and development costs. 12. Segment Reporting Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise
that are evaluated regularly by the Company chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing
performance. The Company chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer. During the third quarter of 2014 the Company sold its Wiring
business segment, which designed and manufactured wiring harness products and assembled instrument panels for sale principally
to the commercial, agricultural and off-highway vehicle markets. As such, for all periods presented the Company reported this
business as discontinued operations in the Companys consolidated financial statements and therefore excluded it from the
segment disclosures herein. See Note 2 for additional details. The Company has three reportable segments, Control Devices,
Electronics and PST, which also represent its operating segments. The Control Devices reportable segment produces sensors, switches,
valves and actuators. The Electronics reportable segment produces electronic instrument clusters, electronic control units and
driver information systems. The PST reportable segment designs and manufactures electronic vehicle security alarms, convenience
accessories, vehicle tracking devices and monitoring services and in-vehicle audio and video devices. Also, during the first half of 2014 the Company changed its
segment operating performance metric in accordance with changes in the financial information reviewed and performance measured
by the Companys chief operating decision maker. As a result, the Company now uses operating income for financial reporting
purposes. Historically, the Company used income before income taxes. The Company has revised the consolidated segment information
for all periods presented to reflect this presentation. The accounting policies of the Companys reportable segments
are the same as those described in Note 2. The Companys management evaluates the performance of its reportable segments
based primarily on revenues from external customers, capital expenditures and operating income. Inter-segment sales are accounted
for on terms similar to those to third parties and are eliminated upon consolidation.   68
