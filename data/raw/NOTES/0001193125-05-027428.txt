Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of November
30, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  We have also
audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2004, based on the criteria established

LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which Lennar Corporation has a controlling interest and variable interest entities see
Note 15 in which Lennar Corporation is deemed the primary beneficiary the Company. The Companys investments in both unconsolidated entities in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and in variable
interest entities in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary are accounted for by the equity method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  Stock Split  In December 2003, the Companys Board of Directors approved a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock payable to stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20, 2004. All share and per share amounts
except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company grants stock options to certain employees for fixed numbers of
shares with, in each instance, an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the shares at the date of the grant. The Company accounts for the stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. No compensation expense is recognized if stock options granted have exercise prices greater than or equal to the fair market value of the Companys stock on the date of the grant.
Compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants if the options are performance-based and the Companys stock has appreciated from the grant date to the measurement date to a fair market value greater than the exercise price of the
options. Compensation expense for performance-based options is recognized using the straight-line method over the vesting period of the options based on the difference between the exercise price of the options and the fair market value of the
Companys stock on the measurement date. The Company also grants restricted stock, which is valued based on the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense arising from restricted stock grants is recognized using
the straight-line method over the period of the restrictions. Unearned compensation for performance-based options and restricted stock is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue Recognition
Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the
sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured.
Cash  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates their fair market values. Cash as of November 30, 2004 and 2003 included
$1273 million and $687 million, respectively, of cash primarily held in escrow for approximately three days and $120 million and $452 million, respectively, of restricted deposits.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory would be written
down to fair market value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. The Company evaluates long-lived
assets for impairment based on the 
40  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
undiscounted future cash flows of the assets. Write-downs of inventories deemed to be impaired would be recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of the
respective inventories. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 or 2002.  Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as incurred. Homes held-for-sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land
development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas.  Interest and Real Estate Taxes  Interest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventories while they are being actively developed. Interest related to
homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to the financial services operations is included in its costs and expenses.  During 2004, 2003 and 2002, interest incurred by the Companys
homebuilding operations was $1379 million, $1318 million and $1306 million, respectively; interest capitalized into inventories was $1376 million, $1295 million and $1268 million, respectively; and interest expense primarily included in cost
of homes sold and cost of land sold was $1342 million, $1413 million and $1456 million, respectively.  Operating Properties and Equipment  Operating properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated
over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited
or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is 30 years, for leasehold improvements is five years and for equipment is two to ten years.  Investment Securities  Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are
carried at fair market value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity.
Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair market value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported in a separate component of stockholders equity, net of tax, until realized.  At November 30, 2004 and 2003, investment securities classified as
held-to-maturity totaled $316 million and $280 million, respectively, and were included in the assets of the Financial Services Division. The held-to-maturity securities consist mainly of certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities. At
November 30, 2004 and 2003, investment securities classified as trading totaled $86 million and $69 million, respectively, and were included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division. The trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable
equity mutual funds designated to approximate the Companys liabilities under its deferred compensation plan. Additionally, at November 30, 2004, investment securities classified as available-for-sale totaled $86 million and were included in
other assets of the Homebuilding Division. The available-for-sale securities are comprised of municipal bonds with an original maturity of 20 years and a cost basis of $85 million. There were no available-for-sale investment securities at November
30, 2003.  Derivative Financial Instruments 
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that
all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair market value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair market value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized
in the statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
41  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The Companys policy is to designate at a derivatives inception the specific assets,
liabilities, or future commitments being hedged and monitor the derivative to determine if it remains an effective hedge. The effectiveness of a derivative as a hedge is based on high correlation between changes in its value and changes in the value
of the underlying hedged item. The Company recognizes gains or losses for amounts received or paid when the underlying transaction settles. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  The Company has various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively
convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $300 million of outstanding debt related to its homebuilding operations. The swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are reflected at their fair market
value in the consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities at November 30, 2004 and 2003. The related loss is deferred, net of tax, in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company accounts
for its interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, as described in SFAS No. 133. Amounts to be received or paid as a result of the swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest incurred on the related debt instruments. The Company
believes that there will be no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps and therefore no portion of the accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into future earnings. The net effect on the Companys operating results
is that interest on the variable-rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates.  The Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of fixed rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in market interest rates. These derivative
financial instruments are designated as fair market value hedges, and, accordingly, for all qualifying and highly effective fair market value hedges, the changes in the fair market value of the derivative and the loss or gain on the hedged asset
related to the risk being hedged are recorded currently in earnings.  Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of
the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, goodwill was $2394 million and $2127 million, respectively net of accumulated amortization of $180 million at November 30, 2004 and 2003.
During fiscal 2004 and 2003, the Companys goodwill increased $267 million and $303 million, respectively, due to current year acquisitions and payment of contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions. During fiscal 2003, the
increase in goodwill was partially offset by the reduction of the Companys net deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a
decrease to goodwill. Goodwill is included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division $1834 million and $1692 million at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively and the assets of the Financial Services Division $560 million and $435
million at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company reviews goodwill annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company performed its annual
impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2004 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 or 2002. As of November 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no material
identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill.  Income
Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are
measured by using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.  Other Liabilities  Other liabilities primarily include homebuyer deposits, accrued compensation, warranty reserves, income taxes payable and minority interest. 
42  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Product Warranty  Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for
materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. Warranty
reserves are included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The activity in the Companys warranty reserve was as follows:  November 30 2004 2003 In thousands Warranty reserve, beginning of year 116,571 93,606 Provision 142,398 120,167 Payments 142,143 97,202 Warranty reserve, end of year 116,826 116,571  Self-Insurance
Certain insurable risks such as general liability,
medical and workers compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Companys self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not
reported.  Minority Interest  The Company has consolidated certain joint ventures because the Company
either was determined to be the primary beneficiary pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No. 46R FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or has a controlling
interest in these joint ventures. Therefore, the entitys financial statements are consolidated in the Companys financial statements and the partners equity is recorded as minority interest. Also included in minority interest is the
estimated fair market value of all third-party interests in variable interest entities. Minority interest is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and minority interest income or expense is included in
management fees and other income, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, minority interest was $427 million and $118 million, respectively.  Advertising Costs  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $603 million, $549 million and $439 million for the years ended November 30,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share, which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.  Financial Services  Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and
loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real
estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. 
43  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Mortgage loans held-for-sale by the Financial Services Division that are designated as hedged assets
are carried at fair market value because the effect of changes in fair market value are reflected in the carrying amount of the loans and in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying
amount of the loans and are not amortized.  When the Division
sells loans in the secondary mortgage market, a gain or loss is recognized to the extent that the sales proceeds exceed, or are less than, the book value of the loans. Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and
recognized as a component of the gain or loss when loans are sold.  Mortgage loans for which the Division has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of mortgage loans carried at cost, net of unamortized discounts. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the
interest method. Interest income on mortgage loans held-for-sale is recognized as earned over the term of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates.  The Division also provides an allowance for loan losses when and if management determines that loans, or portions thereof,
are uncollectible. The provision recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by managements continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic
conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic factors, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be
reasonably determined. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond managements
control.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In March 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission released SEC Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. SAB No. 105 provides the SEC staff position regarding the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America to loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for resale. SAB No. 105 contains specific guidance on the inputs to a valuation-recognition model to measure loan commitments accounted for at fair market
value. Previous accounting guidance required the commitment to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair market value from its inception through its expiration or funding. SAB No. 105 requires that fair-value measurement include only differences
between the guaranteed interest rate in the loan commitment and a market interest rate, excluding any expected future cash flows related to the customer relationship or loan servicing. In addition, SAB No. 105 requires the disclosure of both the
accounting policy for loan commitments, including the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair market value of loan commitments, and any associated hedging strategies. SAB No. 105 is effective for all loan commitments accounted for as
derivatives and entered into subsequent to March 31, 2004. The implementation of SAB No. 105 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based
Payment. SFAS No. 123R establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. In particular, this Statement will require companies to record compensation expense for all
share-based payments, such as employee stock options, at fair market value. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005 the Companys fiscal period beginning
September 1, 2005. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of this Statement on its consolidated financial statements.  2.Acquisitions  During 2004, the Company expanded its presence through homebuilding acquisitions in all of its regions, expanded its mortgage operations in Oregon and
Washington and expanded its title and closing business into Minnesota. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company paid $1057 million, net of cash acquired. The results of
operations of the companies acquired by the Company are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition 
44  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not presented as the effect is not material. Total goodwill associated with
these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions was $267 million.  During 2003, the Company expanded its presence in California and South Carolina through its homebuilding acquisitions, and purchased a title company,
which expanded the Companys title and closing business into the Chicago market. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company paid $1594 million, net of cash acquired. The
results of operations of the companies acquired by the Company are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not
presented as the effect was not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to acquisitions prior to 2003 was $303 million.  During 2002, the Company expanded its operations into the Carolinas and the
Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding markets and strengthened its positions in several of its existing markets through the Companys homebuilding acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, total
consideration, including debt of acquired companies, totaled approximately $600 million. The results of operations of the homebuilders acquired by the Company are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective
acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not presented as the effect was not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these homebuilding acquisitions, as well as the Companys
acquisition of a title company and contingent consideration related to acquisitions prior to 2002 was $836 million.  3.Operating and Reporting Segments  The Company has two operating and reporting segments: Homebuilding and Financial Services. The Companys reportable operating segments are strategic
business units that offer different products and services. The accounting policies of the segments are described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Segment amounts include all elimination adjustments made in consolidation.
The Homebuilding Divisions operations primarily include
the sale and construction of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Companys unconsolidated entities. At November 30, 2004, the Company had
homebuilding divisions located in the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. 
45  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, title and closing
services and insurance agency services for both buyers of the Companys homes and others. Substantially all of the loans it originates are sold in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. The Financial Services
Division also provides high-speed Internet and cable television services to residents of the Companys communities and others. At November 30, 2004, the Financial Services Division operated in the following markets: Arizona, California,
Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.  Financial information related to the Companys reportable operating

42,651  At November 30, 2004,
the Companys equity investment in these unconsolidated entities did not exceed 50%. The Companys partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. The unconsolidated entities follow accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the
day-to-day manager of the unconsolidated entities and receives management fees for performing this function. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, 
47  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from the unconsolidated entities totaling $406 million, $390 million and $292 million,
respectively.  The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain
options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair market value when the options are entered
into. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, $5476 million, $4605 million and $4193 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to the Company. The Company does not include in its equity in earnings from
unconsolidated entities its pro rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the
unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of its share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer.  In some instances, the Company and/or its partners have provided guarantees
on debt of certain unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis. At November 30, 2004, the Company had repayment guarantees of $1613 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $3193 million of unconsolidated entity debt $2000 million of the
limited maintenance guarantees related to NWHL Investment, LLC NWHL. When the Company and/or its partners provide a guarantee, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be
available to it. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if an unconsolidated entity defaults on its loan arrangements and the value of the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance.
If the Company is required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the
unconsolidated entity and increase the Companys share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes. At November 30, 2004, there were no assets held as collateral that, upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under a
guarantee, the Company could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts to be paid under a guarantee.  In November 2003, the Company and LNR Property Corporation LNR each contributed its 50% interests in certain of its jointly-owned
unconsolidated entities that had significant assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities Development LLC LandSource in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July 2003, the Company and LNR
formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL, which in January 2004 purchased The Newhall Land and Farming Company Newhall for a total of approximately $1 billion. Newhalls primary business is developing two master-planned
communities in Los Angeles County, California.  LandSource was
formed as a vehicle to obtain financing based on the value of the combined assets of the joint venture entities that the Company and LNR contributed to LandSource. The Company and LNR used LandSources financing capacity, together with the
financing value of Newhalls assets, to obtain improved financing for part of the purchase price of Newhall and for working capital to be used by the LandSource subsidiaries and Newhall.  The Company and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL, and
LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was a term loan used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of
income-producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217 million at the closing of the transaction. The remainder of the bank financing was a $200 million revolving credit facility that is available to finance operations of Newhall and other
property ownership and development companies that are jointly owned by the Company and LNR. The Company agreed to purchase 687 homesites and obtained options to purchase an additional 623 homesites from Newhall. The Company is not obligated with
regard to the borrowings by LandSource and NWHL, except that the Company and LNR have made limited maintenance guarantees and have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event LandSource or NWHL defaults.  In November 2004, LandSource was merged into NWHL. NWHL was renamed
LandSource Communities Development LLC Merged LandSource upon completion of the merger. The Company and LNR may use 
48  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Merged LandSource for future joint ventures. The consolidated assets and liabilities of Merged LandSource were $13 billion and $7095 million, respectively,
at November 30, 2004 and $3807 million and $1223 million, respectively, at November 30, 2003. The Companys investment in Merged LandSource was $3187 million and $1288 million at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  6.Operating Properties and Equipment  November 30 2004 2003 In thousands Furniture, fixtures and equipment 32,190 38,354 Community recreational facilities 7,126 6,083 Leasehold improvements 18,170 13,032 57,486 57,469 Accumulated depreciation and amortization 36,175 36,631 21,311 20,838  Operating properties

Company amended and restated its senior unsecured credit facilities the Credit Facilities to provide the Company with up to $12 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities also include access to an additional $190 million via an
accordion feature, under which the Credit Facilities may be increased to $14 billion, subject to additional commitments. The Credit Facilities, including $115 million committed in October 2004 under the accordion feature, consist of a $9279
million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2009 and a $3976 million 364-day revolving credit facility maturing in 2005. Subsequent to November 30, 2004, the Company received additional commitments of $70 million under the accordion feature.
Prior to the amendment, in March 2004, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan B portion of the Credit Facilities. The Company may elect to convert borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility to a term loan,
which would mature in May 2009. The Credit Facilities are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries which include mortgage and title insurance
subsidiaries. Interest rates are LIBOR-based, and the margins are set by a pricing grid with thresholds that adjust based on changes in the Companys leverage ratio and the Credit Facilities credit ratings. At November 30, 2004, no
amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facilities.  At
November 30, 2004, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $7874 million. The majority of these letters of credit is posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the Companys performance of certain development and
construction activities or is posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of the 
49  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Companys total letters of credit outstanding, $2514 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities.
In September 2004, the Company entered into a structured
letter of credit facility the LC Facility with a financial institution. The purpose of the LC Facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to $200 million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis. In connection with the
transaction, the financial institution issued $200 million of their senior notes, which were linked to the Companys performance on the LC Facility. If there is an event of default under the LC Facility, including the Companys failure to
reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit, the financial institution would assign its claim against the Company, to the extent of the amount due and payable by the Company under the LC Facility, to its noteholders in lieu of paying
principal on their performance linked notes. At November 30, 2004, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $1964 million under the LC Facility.  In March and April 2004, the Company issued a total of $300 million of senior floating-rate notes due 2009 the
Initial Notes, which are callable at par beginning in March 2006. Proceeds from the offerings, after underwriting discount and expenses, were $2985 million. The Company used the proceeds to partially prepay the term loan B portion of
the Credit Facilities and added the remainder to the Companys working capital to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan B with cash from the Companys working capital.
Interest on the Initial Notes is three-month LIBOR plus 075% 316% as of November 30, 2004 and is payable quarterly, compared to the term loan B interest of three-month LIBOR plus 175%. The Initial Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated. At
November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the Initial Notes was $3000 million.  In June 2004, the Company filed a registration statement related to an offer to exchange fully guaranteed senior floating-rate notes due 2009, series B the New Notes for the Initial Notes. The New Notes
would be substantially identical with the Initial Notes, except that the New Notes would be guaranteed by all of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries, including subsidiaries formed or acquired by the Company after October 9, 2001, other than
finance company subsidiaries. In December 2004, the registration statement became effective. In January 2005, the Company exchanged all of the Initial Notes for the New Notes.  In August 2004, the Company sold $250 million of 550% senior notes due 2014 at a price of 98842% in a private placement.
Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $2455 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior notes is due semi-annually. The senior notes
are unsecured and unsubordinated. Substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior notes. At November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the senior notes was $2471 million.
In August 2004, the Company also sold $200 million of senior
floating-rate notes due 2007 in a private placement. The senior floating-rate notes are callable at par beginning in February 2006. Proceeds from the offering, after initial purchasers discount and expenses, were $1993 million. The Company
used the proceeds to repay borrowings under its Credit Facilities. Interest on the senior floating-rate notes is three-month LIBOR plus 050% 291% as of November 30, 2004 and is payable quarterly. The senior floating-rate notes are unsecured and
unsubordinated. Substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than finance company subsidiaries, guaranteed the senior floating-rate notes. At November 30, 2004, the carrying value of the senior floating-rate notes was $2000 million.
In February 2003, the Company issued $350 million of 595%
senior notes due 2013 at a price of 98287%. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were $3417 million. The Company used approximately $116 million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the
remainder to its general working capital. The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Companys subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities.
At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of the senior notes was $3447 million and $3443 million, respectively.  In June 2003, the Company called its 37/8% zero-coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 the Debentures for redemption. At the option of the holders, the Debentures could have been converted into Class 
50  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
A common stock at any time prior to the redemption date. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures was convertible into 274814 shares of Class
A common stock inclusive of the adjustment for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split, which equated to a redemption price of $2046 per share of Class A common stock. In 2003, substantially all of
the Debentures were converted into 136 million shares of Class A common stock adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split.  In the second quarter of 2001, the Company issued, for gross proceeds of approximately $230 million, zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due
2021 the Notes with a face amount at maturity of approximately $633 million. The Notes were issued at a price of $36346 per $1,000 face amount at maturity, which equates to a yield to maturity over the life of the Notes of 5125%.
Proceeds from the issuance, after underwriting discount, were $2243 million. The Company used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and added the balance of the net proceeds to working capital. The
indenture relating to the Notes provides that the Notes are convertible into the Companys Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Companys Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted conversion
price at the rate of 142 Class A common shares per $1,000 face amount of Notes at maturity, which would total 90 million shares adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split. For this
purpose, the market price is the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a fiscal quarter.  Other events that would cause the Notes to be convertible are: a a call of the Notes for redemption; b the initial credit
ratings assigned to the Notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are two rating levels below the initial rating; c a distribution to all holders of the Companys
Class A common stock of options expiring within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d a distribution to all holders of the Companys Class A common stock of common stock, assets, debt,
securities or rights to purchase securities with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for the distribution. The conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion
price of $2564 per share when the Companys stock price was $1942 per share adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split.  At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the Notes were convertible because the average closing price of the Companys Class A
common stock over the last twenty trading days of the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003 adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split exceeded 110% $3396 per share at November 30, 2004 of the
accreted conversion price. These shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended November 30, 2002 because the contingencies discussed above were not met.  Holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase the Notes on any
of the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to the purchase date. The Company has the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and/or shares of the
Companys Class A common stock. The Company will have the option to redeem the Notes, in cash, at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to redemption. The Company will pay contingent interest on the
Notes during specified six-month periods beginning on April 4, 2006 if the market price of the Notes exceeds specified levels. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the carrying value of outstanding Notes, net of unamortized original issue discount, was
$2746 million and $2610 million, respectively.  At November
30, 2004, the Company had mortgage notes on land and other debt bearing interest at rates up to 250% with an average interest rate of 62%. The notes are due through 2009 and are collateralized by land. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the carrying
value of the mortgage notes on land and other debt was $757 million and $730 million, respectively.

the Financial Services Division had warehouse lines of credit totaling $950 million, which included a $275 million temporary increase that expired in December 2004, to fund its mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $8728
million and $7144 million at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of $8947 million and $7422 million,
respectively. There are several interest rate-pricing options, which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2004 and 2003 was 29% and 17%, respectively. The warehouse lines of credit mature
during 2005 at which time the Division expects the facilities to be renewed. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the Division had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $52 million and $06 million,
respectively. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans and had an effective interest rate of 32% and 19% at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Division also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a
bank that matures in July 2005, at which time the Division expects the line of credit to be renewed. The line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit
were $189 million and $194 million at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and had an effective interest rate of 31% and 21% at November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Divisions notes and other debts payable totaling $8969
million are due in 2005. 
52  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
The limited-purpose finance subsidiaries of the Financial Services Division have placed mortgages and
other receivables as collateral for various long-term financings. These limited-purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral,
which includes a combination of mortgage notes, mortgage-backed securities and funds held by a trustee. At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the balances outstanding for the bonds and notes payable were $34 million and $58 million, respectively. The
borrowings mature in 2015 through 2018 and carry interest rates ranging from 88% to 117%. The annual principal repayments are dependent upon collections on the underlying mortgages, including prepayments, and therefore cannot be reasonably
determined.  9.Income Taxes

At November 30, 2004 and 2003, the Financial Services Division had a net deferred tax asset of $65
million and $111 million, respectively, which is included in the assets of the Financial Services Division.  SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Based on managements assessment, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. During fiscal 2003,
restrictions associated with the utilization of the capital loss carryforwards and acquisition adjustments lapsed, resulting in the reduction of the valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the
reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to goodwill.  A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective tax rate follows:  PercentageofPre-taxEarnings 2004 2003 2002 Statutory rate

outstanding and anti-dilutive at November 30, 2004. Anti-dilutive options outstanding at November 30, 2003 and 2002 were not material.  In 2001, the Company issued zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due 2021. The indenture relating to the notes provides that the notes are
convertible into the Companys Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Companys Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted 
54  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
conversion price at the rate of 142 Class A common shares per $1,000 face amount of notes at maturity, which would total 90 million shares adjusted for
the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split. For this purpose, the market price is the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a
fiscal quarter.  Other events that would cause the notes to be
convertible are: a a call of the notes for redemption; b the initial credit ratings assigned to the notes by any two of Moodys Investors Service, Inc., Standard Poors Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are two rating levels below
the initial rating; c a distribution to all holders of the Companys Class A common stock of options expiring within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d a distribution to all holders of
the Companys Class A common stock of common stock, assets, debt, securities or rights to purchase securities with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for
the distribution.  The calculation of diluted earnings per
share included 90 million shares adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split for the year ended November 30, 2004 because the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock
over the last twenty trading days of each of the Companys fiscal quarters through November 30, 2004 exceeded 110% $3396 per share as of November 30, 2004 of the accreted conversion price. The calculation of diluted earnings per share
included 45 million shares adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B distribution and January 2004 two-for-one distribution for the year ended November 30, 2003 because the average closing price of the Companys Class A common stock over the
last twenty trading days of both the third and fourth quarters of 2003 exceeded 110% of the accreted conversion price. These shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended November 30, 2002 because the
contingencies discussed above were not met.  11.Comprehensive Income  Comprehensive income represents changes in stockholders equity from non-owner sources. The components of comprehensive income were as follows:  Years Ended November 30 2004 2003

Stock  Preferred Stock  The Company is authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock with a
par value of $10 per share and 100 million shares of participating preferred stock with a par value of $010 per share. No shares of preferred stock or participating preferred stock have been issued as of November 30, 2004.  Common Stock  On April 8, 2003, at the Companys Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the
Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the Companys certificate of incorporation that eliminated the restrictions on the transfer of the Companys Class B common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the
common stock renamed Class A common stock and the Class B common stock. The only significant remaining 
55  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
difference between the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock is that the Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the
Class B common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share.  Because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the Class B common stock, the Company distributed to the holders of record of its stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten
shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock held at that time. The distribution occurred on April 21, 2003, and the Companys Class B common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange NYSE. The Companys
Class A common stock was already listed on the NYSE. Approximately 13 million shares of Class B common stock adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split were issued as a result of the stock distribution.  Additionally, the Companys stockholders approved an amendment to the
certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue to 300 million shares of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock. However, the Company has committed to
Institutional Shareholder Services that it will not issue, without a subsequent stockholder vote, shares that would increase the outstanding Class A common stock to more than 170 million shares or increase the outstanding Class B common stock to
more than 45 million shares.  In December 2003, the
Companys Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock payable to stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20,
2004. All share and per share amounts except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. There was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split.
In September 2004, the Companys Board of Directors voted
to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to the Companys Class A and Class B common stock to $055 per share per year payable quarterly from $050 per share per year payable quarterly. Dividend rates were adjusted for the
Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split. During 2004 and 2003, Class A and Class B common stockholders received annual dividends of $051 per share and $014 per share, respectively. During 2002, Class A common stockholders received an
annual dividend of $0025 per share and Class B common stockholders received an annual dividend of $00225 per share, both payable quarterly.  As of November 30, 2004, Mr. Stuart Miller, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer, directly owned, or controlled through family-owned
entities, approximately 22 million shares of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 47% voting power of the Companys stock.  In June 2001, the Companys Board of Directors increased the previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20
million shares adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split of the Companys outstanding Class A common stock. During 2003 and 2002, the Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding Class A common stock in the open market under
these authorizations. In December 2003, the Company granted approximately 24 million stock options adjusted for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split to employees under the Companys 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock
Plan, and in January 2004 the Company repurchased a similar number of shares of its outstanding Class A common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1096 million, or $4564 per share adjusted
for the Companys January 2004 two-for-one stock split. As of November 30, 2004, 176 million Class A common shares can be repurchased in the future under the program. During December 2004 and January 2005, the Company repurchased a total of
19 million shares of its outstanding Class A common stock under the stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of $1053 million, or $5439 per share.  Additionally, during the year ended November 30, 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 91,000 Class A common shares
related to the vesting of restricted stock and distributions of common stock from the Companys deferred compensation plan. 
56  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
At November 30, 2004, the Company had shelf registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, relating to up to $320 million of equity or debt securities which it may sell for cash and up to $400 million of equity or debt securities which it could issue in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in them, businesses
or assets.  Restrictions on Payment of Dividends
Other than as required to maintain the financial ratios
and net worth required by the Credit Facilities, there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock by the Company. There are no agreements which restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries of the Company other than as
required to maintain the financial ratios and net worth requirements under the Financial Services Divisions warehouse lines of credit.  Stock Option Plans  The Lennar Corporation 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan the 2003 Plan provides for the granting of Class A and Class B stock
options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the
date of the grant. No options granted under the 2003 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock
appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2004, there were 10,000 Class B common shares of restricted stock outstanding under the 2003 Plan.
The stock was valued based on its market price on the date of the grant. The grants vest over five years from the date of issuance.  The Lennar Corporation 2000 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan the 2000 Plan provided for the granting of Class A stock options and
stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. No options granted under the 2000 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are
permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2004, a
combined total of 518,100 shares of Class A and Class B restricted stock were outstanding under the Plan. The stock was valued based on its market price on the date of the grant. The grants vest over five years from the date of issuance. 
The Lennar Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan the 1997 Plan
provided for the granting of Class A stock options and stock appreciation rights to key employees of the Company to purchase shares at prices not less than market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1997
Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right granted will expire on a date
determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant.  The Lennar Corporation 1991 Stock Option Plan the 1991 Plan provided for the granting of Class A stock options to key employees of the Company to purchase shares at prices not less than market value of
the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1991 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each
stock option granted will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant.

40 years 4643  The Company distributed to the holders of record of its stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten shares of Class A common
stock or Class B common stock held at that time. As a result of anti-dilution provisions in the Companys stock option plans, each time an option is exercised with regard to ten shares of Class A common stock, the option holder will also
receive one share of Class B common stock. The options cannot be exercised to purchase just Class B common stock, and there is no separate exercise price related to the Class B common stock. The Company did not adjust the number of stock options or
the exercise price related to the Class A stock options. There was no accounting consequence from the anti-dilution effect of the Class B common stock distribution.  Employee Stock Ownership/401k Plan  Prior to 1998, the Employee Stock Ownership/401k Plan the Plan provided shares of Class A common stock to
employees who had completed one year of continuous service with the Company. During 1998, the Plan was amended to exclude any new shares from being provided to employees. All prior year contributions to employees actively employed on or after
October 1, 1998 vest at a rate of 20% per year over a five-year period. All active participants in the Plan whose employment terminated prior to October 1, 1998 vested based upon the Plan that was active prior to their termination of employment.
Under the 401k portion of the Plan, contributions made by employees can be invested in a variety of mutual funds or proprietary funds provided by the Plan trustee. The Company may also make contributions for the benefit of employees. The Company
records as compensation expense an amount, which approximates the vesting of the contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership portion of the Plan, as well as the Companys contribution to the 401k portion of the Plan. This amount was $103
million in 2004, $91 million in 2003 and $70 million in 2002. 
58  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
13.Deferred Compensation Plan  In June 2002, the Company adopted the Lennar Corporation Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan the Deferred Compensation Plan that allows a selected group of members of management to defer a portion of their salaries and bonuses and up to 100% of their restricted stock. All participant contributions to
the Deferred Compensation Plan are vested. Salaries and bonuses that are deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings or losses based on investment decisions made by the participants. The cash contributions to the
Deferred Compensation Plan are invested by the Company in various investment securities that are classified as trading.  Restricted stock is deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan by surrendering the restricted stock in exchange for the right to receive in the future
a number of shares equal to the number of restricted shares that are surrendered. The surrender is reflected as a reduction in stockholders equity equal to the value of the restricted stock when it was issued, with an offsetting increase in
stockholders equity to reflect a deferral of the compensation expense related to the surrendered restricted stock. Changes in the value of the shares that will be issued in the future are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
As of November 30, 2004, approximately 695,300 Class A common
shares and 69,600 Class B common shares of restricted stock had been surrendered in exchange for rights under the Deferred Compensation Plan, resulting in a reduction in stockholders equity of $64 million fully offset by an increase in
stockholders equity to reflect the deferral of compensation in that amount. Shares that the Company is obligated to issue in the future under the Deferred Compensation Plan are treated as outstanding shares in both the Companys basic and
diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

14.Financial Instruments  The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair market
values of financial instruments held by the Company at November 30, 2004 and 2003, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market
data to develop the estimates of fair market value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair market value amounts. The table excludes cash, receivables and accounts payable, which had fair market values approximating their carrying values due to the short maturities
of these instruments.  November 30 2004

The following methods
and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair market values:  HomebuildingSince there are no quoted market prices for investments classified as available-for-sale, the fair market value is estimated from available yield curves for investments of similar quality and
terms. The fair market value for investments classified as trading is based on quoted market prices. For senior notes and other debts payable, the fair market value of fixed-rate borrowings is based on quoted market prices. Variable-rate borrowings
are tied to market indices and therefore approximate fair market value. The fair market value for interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotations and generally represents an estimate of the amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate the
agreement at the reporting date.  Financial
servicesThe fair market values are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair market values for instruments that do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other
financial information.  The Homebuilding Division utilizes
interest rate swap agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. Credit losses from counterparty non-performance are not
anticipated. A majority of the Divisions 
60  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
available variable interest rate borrowings are based on the LIBOR index. At November 30, 2004, the Division had four interest rate swap agreements
outstanding with a total notional amount of $300 million, which will mature at various dates through 2008. These agreements fixed the LIBOR index at an average interest rate of 68% at November 30, 2004. The effect of the interest rate swap
agreements on interest incurred and on the average interest rate was an increase of $165 million and 089%, respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2004, an increase of $167 million and 103%, respectively, for the year ended November 30,
2003 and an increase of $170 million and 108%, respectively, for the year ended November 30, 2002.  The Financial Services Division had a pipeline of loans in process totaling approximately $31 billion at November 30, 2004. To minimize credit risk, the
Division uses the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to the Divisions lending activities. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled $5199 million as of November 30,
2004. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.  The Financial Services Division uses mandatory
mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments and MBS option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold
to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting the
Divisions credit standards. The Divisions risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair market value. At November 30, 2004, the Division had open commitments amounting to $2736
million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2005.  15.Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  In December 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R, which further clarified and amended FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs
a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46R,
entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN 46R applied immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003, and with respect to variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46R applied in the Companys second quarter ended May 31, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Companys results
of operations or cash flows.  Unconsolidated Entities
At November 30, 2004, the Company had investments in and
advances to unconsolidated entities established to acquire and develop land for sale to the Company in connection with its homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. The
Company evaluated all agreements under FIN 46R. During the year ended November 30, 2004, the Company consolidated entities under FIN 46R that at November 30, 2004 had total combined assets and liabilities of $815 million and $398 million,
respectively.  At November 30, 2004, the Companys
recorded investment in unconsolidated entities was $8564 million; however, the Companys estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated entities was its recorded investments in these entities in addition to the exposure under
the guarantees discussed in Note 5.  Option Contracts
The Company evaluated all option contracts for land and
determined it was the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46R, the Company, if it is deemed the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate
the land under option at fair market value. During the year ended November 30, 2004, the effect of the consolidation of these option 
61  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
contracts was an increase of $3366 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated
inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2004. This increase was offset primarily by the Company exercising its option to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated under FIN 46R,
resulting in a net increase in consolidated inventory not owned of $2265 million. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46R, the Company reclassified $734 million of related option deposits from land under
development to consolidated inventory not owned. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned represent the difference between the exercise price of the optioned land and the Companys option deposits.  At November 30, 2004, the Companys exposure to loss related to its
option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities represented its non-refundable deposits and advanced costs totaling $2224 million as well as letters of credit posted in lieu of cash deposits.  16.Commitments and Contingent Liabilities  The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various claims, legal actions
and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.
The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated
with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase, development and sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable the Company to defer acquiring
portions of properties owned by third parties and certain unconsolidated entities until the Company is ready to build homes on them. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land
holdings. At November 30, 2004, the Company had access to acquire approximately 168,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which the Company had investments. At November 30, 2004, the Company had $2224 million of
non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these homesites.  At November 30, 2004, the Company had $740 million of reserves recorded in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies, for tax filing positions based on the Companys evaluation that
uncertainty exists in sustaining the deductions. This reserve is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at November 30, 2004.  The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future
minimum payments under the non-cancelable leases in effect at November 30, 2004 are as follows:  LeasePayments Inthousands

Rental expense for the
years ended November 30, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $847 million, $632 million and $550 million, respectively.  The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in
the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $7874 million at November 30, 2004. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds with estimated costs to complete of $13 billion related
principally to its obligations for site improvements at various projects at November 30, 2004. The Company does not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

12  PART II  Item 5.Controls and Procedures.  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated in an
evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our fiscal quarter that ended on November 30, 2004. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of November 30, 2004 to ensure that required information is disclosed on a timely basis in our reports filed or furnished under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Our CEO and CFO also participated in an evaluation by our management of any
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended November 30, 2004. That evaluation did not identify any changes that have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.  Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2004. Our managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2004 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.
72  REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar
Corporation  We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2004, based on
the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.  Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  In our opinion, managements assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended November 30, 2004 of the Company and our reports dated February 11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.  /s/ DELOITTE TOUCHE LLP  Certified Public Accountants  Miami, Florida February 11, 2005
