ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Ag-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ag-Chem
Equipment Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997 and the
related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 1998.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ag-Chem Equipment
Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1998 and 1997 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended September 30, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.                     KPMG Peat Marwick LLP Minneapolis, Minnesota

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Ag-Chem Equipment Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries the Company. All
material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The Company extends credit primarily to agricultural cooperatives
and dealers in the United States and Canada, and to international distributors.
The Company also provides financing for the sales of equipment through notes
receivable and operating leases.
INVENTORIES
Substantially all inventories except used equipment are stated at
the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last in, first out
LIFO method for all inventories other than used equipment. Used equipment is
valued at amounts which do not exceed estimated fair market value.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and
amortization of all property, plant and equipment is computed on straight-line
and accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives                         Years
Land improvements          15-20
Buildings and improvements     15-40
Rental property           5-40
Machinery and equipment       5-10
Rental equipment            5
Transportation equipment       3-5
Office equipment and furniture    5-10
Computer equipment          5-7
INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BOND ISSUE
Reserve bond funds relate to industrial revenue bonds issued by the
City of Jackson, Minnesota to finance the acquisition of a portion of the
Company Jackson, Minnesota facilities and will be used to pay principal and
interest due on the bonds only when amounts deposited by the Company are
insufficient.
Industrial revenue bond issuance costs have been deferred and are
being amortized over the term of the bonds using the effective interest method.                    F-8 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AG-CHEMEQUIPMENT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS
Intangible and other assets, net of accumulated amortization,
consists of the following                                         September 30,
1998    1997 
Excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets purchased   $1,355   $1,928
Non compete agreements                             224     320
Deferred financing costs                            253     326
Manufacturing and marketing rights                       672     874
Other                                      213     92
Total intangible and other assets                      $2,717   $3,540
Intangible and other assets are capitalized at cost and, except for
deferred financing costs, are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
ranging from two to ten years. Deferred financing costs are being amortized over
the term of the financing using the effective interest method.
Management periodically assesses the amortization period and
recoverability of the carrying amounts of intangible assets based upon an
estimation of their value and future benefits of the recorded asset. Management
has concluded that the carrying amount of the intangible assets is realizable.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
The Company research and development expenditures are expensed as
incurred and totaled $10,846, $9,361 and $7,208 for fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
INCOME TAXES
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
For the Company Dutch operation, the Dutch guilder is considered
the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the
exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are
translated using the average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period.
Translation effects are accumulated in the foreign currency adjustment caption
in stockholders' equity.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Earnings per common share are computed based upon the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the respective years. The
Company has no dilutive-potential common stock equivalents.                    F-9 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AG-CHEMEQUIPMENT CO., INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS REVENUE RECOGNITION
Payments for future deliveries of equipment are classified as
customer prepayments. Customers will periodically pay for equipment in advance
of shipment to secure either more favorable pricing or a desired delivery date.
The primary benefits to the Company are that it generates additional sales and
allows the Company to improve economies of scale by better scheduling its
production. The Company recognizes revenue relating to customer deposits upon
shipment of the related equipment.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
The Company made contributions of $414, $3,171, and $4,778 to its
profit sharing plan in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.
STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers
all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents.
IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF
The Company reviews its long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of
assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of
an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
During fiscal 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, SFAS No. 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, and SFAS
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The
Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement of Position SOP
98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use. With the exception of SFAS No. 133, these standards are effective
in fiscal 1999, and the adoption of the standards will have no impact on the
Company financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
SFAS No. 133 establishes new standards for recognizing all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities and measuring those instruments at
fair value. The Company will be required to adopt the new standard beginning
with the first quarter of fiscal 2000; earlier application is permitted. The
Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of this statement.

Most of the Company financial instruments are recorded on the
balance sheet. Quoted market prices generally are not available for all of the
Company financial instruments. Accordingly, fair values are based on judgments
regarding current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial
instruments and other factors. These estimates involve uncertainties and matters
of judgment, and therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in
assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.
A description of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the
fair value of each class of the Company financial instruments is as follows ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
As the average collection period for these is less than 45 days, the carrying
amount approximates fair value.
NOTES RECEIVABLE
The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated by discounting
future cash flows using current discount rates that reflect the risks associated
with similar types of loans.
BOND FUNDS
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.
NOTE PAYABLE TO BANK
The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these
instruments.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, CHECKS OUTSTANDING IN EXCESS OF CASH BALANCES, AND ACCRUED
EXPENSES The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity
of these instruments.
LONG-TERM DEBT
The fair value of the Company long-term debt was estimated based on the amount
of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the
current rates offered to the Company for similar debt instruments of comparable
maturity.
The carrying amount and estimated fair values of the Company
financial instruments at September 30, 1998 and 1997 are summarized as follows                     1998          1997
