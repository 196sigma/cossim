ITEM8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA Report on Managements Assessment of Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting Gardner Denver management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f.
Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has
inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control
can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes
in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over
time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control
over financial reporting will provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation. Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
its evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, management
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December31, 2005, subject to the scope
limitation with respect to Thomas as discussed in the paragraph
below. Gardner Denver acquired Thomas on July1, 2005. As
permitted by SEC guidance, management excluded from its
assessment of the effectiveness of Gardner Denvers
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, Thomas internal control over
financial reporting. Total assets related to Thomas as of
December31, 2005 were $654million and revenues for
the six-month period subsequent to the acquisition July1,
2005- December31, 2005 were $202million. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Gardner Denver, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Gardner Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An 32 audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Gardner Denver, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of Gardner Denver, Inc.s internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March13, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and the effective operation of,
internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP St.Louis, Missouri March13, 2006 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Gardner Denver, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Report on Managements Assessment of Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting, that Gardner Denver, Inc. the
Company maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Gardner Denver, Inc.s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. 33 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Gardner
Denver, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework
issued by COSO. The Company acquired Thomas Industries, Inc. Thomas on
July1, 2005, and management excluded from its assessment
of the effectiveness of Gardner Denver, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005,
Thomas internal control over financial reporting. Total
assets related to Thomas at December31, 2005 of
$654million and revenues for the six-month period
subsequent to the acquisition July1, 2005to
December31, 2005 of $202million were included in
the consolidated financial statements of Gardner Denver, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December31,
2005. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of
Gardner Denver, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of Thomas. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Gardner Denver, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December31, 2005, and our
report dated March13, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. KPMG LLP St.Louis, Missouri March13, 2006 34 Consolidated Statements of Operations GARDNER DENVER, INC. Years ended December31 Dollars in thousands except per share amounts

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these
statements. 38 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements GARDNER DENVER, INC. Dollars in thousands except per share amounts or amounts
described in millions Note1:Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
operations of Gardner Denver, Inc. Gardner Denver
or the Company and its subsidiaries. Certain prior
year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been
eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign operations
are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at
average rates prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income, a separate component of stockholders equity. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes product revenue when the products are
shipped and title passes to the customer and collection is
reasonably assured. Service revenue is recognized when services
are performed and earned and collection is reasonably assured. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments valued at cost,
which approximates fair value acquired with an original
maturity of three months or less. As of December31, 2005,
cash of $30million was pledged to financial institutions
as collateral to support the issuance of standby letters of
credit and similar instruments on behalf of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivables consist of amounts owed for orders
shipped to and services performed for customers and are stated
net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Reviews of
customers credit worthiness are performed prior to
accepting orders. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a
combination of factors including the length of time that the
receivables are past due, historical collection trends and
circumstances relating to specific 39 customers inability to meet their financial obligations of
which the Company has knowledge or becomes aware. Inventories Inventories, which consist of materials, labor and manufacturing
overhead, are carried at the lower of cost or market value. As
of December31, 2005, $1443million 70% of the
Companys inventory is accounted for on a
first-in, first-out
FIFObasis, with the remaining $630million 30%
accounted for on a
last-in, first-out
LIFObasis. Management regularly reviews inventory for
obsolescence to determine whether a write-down is necessary.
Various factors are considered in making this determination,
including recent sales history and predicted trends, industry
market conditions and general economic conditions. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets: buildings- 10 to
45years; machinery and equipment- 10 to
12years; office furniture and equipment- 3 to
10years; and tooling, dies, patterns, etc.- 3 to
7years. Goodwill and Other Intangibles Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill
are not subject to amortization. All other intangible assets are
amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and other
intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. This
testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values,
and when appropriate, the carrying value of impaired assets is
reduced to fair value. The Company estimates fair value using
available information regarding expected future cash flows and a
discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital specific to
the Company. The Company uses the straight-line method to amortize intangible
assets subject to amortization over their estimated useful
lives, generally 5 to 20years. During the second quarter
of 2005, the Company completed its annual impairment test and
determined that no impairment existed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be
Disposed Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.
If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value, less costs to dispose. Product Warranty The Companys product warranty liability is calculated
based primarily upon historical warranty claims experience.
Management also factors into the product warranty accrual any
specific warranty issues identified during the period which are
expected to impact future periods and may not be consistent with
historical claims experience. Product warranty accruals are
reviewed regularly by management and adjusted from time to time
when actual warranty claims experience differs from that
estimated. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit
obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans
requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions.
These assumptions include the discount rate used to value the
projected benefit obligation, future rate of compensation
increases, expected 40 rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend
rates. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from
the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future
periods. While management believes that the assumptions are
appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in
assumptions may affect the Companys pension and other
postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic
benefit cost. Income Taxes The Company has determined tax expense and other deferred tax
information based on the liability method. Deferred income taxes
are provided to reflect temporary differences between financial
and tax reporting. Research and Development During the years ended December31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
the Company spent $223million, $98million, and
$66million, respectively on research activities relating
to the development of new products and the improvement of
existing products. Financial Instruments All derivative financial instruments are reported on the balance
sheet at fair value. For each derivative instrument designated
as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is
deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until
recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item. For each
derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain
or loss on the derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or
loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in earnings.
Currency fluctuations on
non-U.S.dollar
borrowings that have been designated as hedges on the
Companys investment in a foreign subsidiary are included
in other comprehensive income. Stock-Based Compensation The company has employee stock-based compensation plans, which
are described more fully in Note12 Stock-Based
Compensation Plans herein. As allowed under
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company measures its compensation
cost of equity instruments issued under employee compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. In December
2002, the FASB issued SFASNo148,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure, an Amendment to SFASNo123, to
require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. Under APB No25, no compensation
cost was recognized for the Companys stock option plans,
as all stock options granted under those plans had an exercise
price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. Had compensation cost for the Companys
stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at
the grant date for awards outstanding during 41 2005, 2004 and 2003, consistent with the provisions of
SFASNo123, the Companys net income and
earnings per share would have been as shown in the table below

Compensation costs charged against income net of tax for
restricted stock issued under the Companys Incentive Plan
totaled $02million in 2003. There were no restricted
stock awards or other stock-based compensation included in net
income in 2005 or 2004. The fair value of each option grant under the Companys
Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively

Pension and Postretirement Benefits. Changes in Accounting Principles and Effects of New
Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No151, Inventory
Costs- an amendment to ARB No43,
Chapter4. This Statement amends previous
guidance and requires expensing for abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
spoilage. In addition, the Statement requires that allocation
of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the
normal capacity of production facilities. SFASNo151
is effective for inventory costs incurred during annual periods
beginning after June15, 2005. The Company adopted the
provisions of SFASNo151 effective January1,
2006. The initial implementation had no effect on the
Companys consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations. 42 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123
revised 2004, Share-Based Payment
SFASNo123R, which is a revision
of SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. SFASNo123R supersedes APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and amends SFASNo95,
Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the
approach in SFASNo123R is similar to the approach
described in SFASNo123. However,
SFASNo123R requires all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
expensed based on their fair values. On April14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC adopted a rule that delayed the effective date
of SFASNo123R, which required adoption no later
than July1, 2005. The SEC rule allows companies to
implement SFASNo123R at the beginning of their
next fiscal year that begins after June15, 2005. The new
SEC rule does not change the accounting required by
SFASNo123R. Gardner Denver adopted the provisions
of FASNo123R effective January1, 2006,
using the modified-prospective method, which requires the
recognition of compensation costs beginning with the effective
date abased on the requirements of
SFASNo123R for all share-based payments granted
after the effective date and bbased on the requirements
of SFASNo123 for all awards granted to employees
prior to the effective date of SFASNo123R that
remain unvested on the effective date. As permitted by SFASNo123 through the year ended
December31, 2005, Gardner Denver accounted for share-based
payments to employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed by APB25 and, as such, generally recognized no
compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the
adoption of the fair value method in SFASNo123R
will have an impact on Gardner Denvers results of
operations, although it will have no impact on Gardner
Denvers overall financial position. Management expects
that the adoption of SFASNo123R will decrease net
income for 2006 by approximately $36million to
$42million. A disproportionate amount of this expense
will be recognized in the first quarter of 2006, due to the
number of options held by employees eligible for retirement. The
Companys estimate is based on the assumption that the
value of the 2005 stock option grant recurs in 2006. Gardner
Denvers stock option grants contain a provision that
accelerates vesting of options for holders that retire and have
met retirement eligibility requirements. Currently, as part of
the pro forma disclosures required by SFASNo123,
Gardner Denver records a pro forma expense for the unrecognized
compensation cost in the period that the accelerated vesting
occurs. However, upon adoption of SFASNo123R,
Gardner Denver will recognize compensation expense based on
retirement eligibility dates for all options which contain an
accelerated vesting provision. SFASNo123R also
requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current
literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash
flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after
adoption. In March 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting
BulletinNo107 SAB107 to assist
preparers with the implementation of SFASNo123R.
SAB107 recognizes that considerable judgment will be
required by preparers to successfully implement
SFASNo123R, specifically when valuing employee
stock options, and that reasonable individuals, acting in good
faith, may conclude differently on the fair value of employee
stock options. Gardner Denver will apply the principles of
SAB107 in conjunction with its adoption of
SFASNo123R. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFASNo154,
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,
SFASNo154, which requires
retrospective application for reporting a voluntary change in
accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to do so.
SFASNo154 provides guidance for determining whether
retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is
impracticable and also addresses the reporting of a correction
of error by restating previously issued financial statements.
SFASNo154 is effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2005. The Company adopted the provisions of
SFASNo154 effective January1, 2006. The
initial implementation had no effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position or consolidated results of
operations. 43 Note2:Business Combinations Acquisition of Thomas Industries Inc. On July1, 2005, the Company acquired Thomas, previously a
New York Stock Exchange listed company traded under the ticker
symbol TII. Thomas is a worldwide leader in the
design, manufacture and marketing of precision engineered pumps,
compressors and blowers. The acquisition of Thomas allowed the
Company to further diversify its revenue base, expand its
presence in higher growth end markets and broaden its sales
channels with a strong focus on OEMs. Thomas products are
complementary to the Compressor and Vacuum Products
segments product portfolio. The agreed-upon purchase price
of $4000per share for all outstanding shares and share
equivalents approximately $7342million was paid in the
form of cash and the assumption of approximately
$76million of long-term capitalized lease obligations. As
of June30, 2005, Thomas had $2653million in cash
and equivalents. The net transaction value, including assumed
debt net of cash acquired and direct acquisition costs, was
approximately $4835million. There are no additional
contingent payments or commitments related to this acquisition. The balance sheet accounts and results of operations of Thomas
were included in Gardner Denvers Consolidated Financial
Statements beginning on July1, 2005. The following table
summarizes the Companys preliminary estimates of the fair
values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the
date of acquisition and includes subsequent adjustments to the
allocation of purchase price. This allocation is subject to
change upon completion of appraisals in 2006. Further, other
assets and liabilities may be identified to which a portion of
the purchase price could be allocated. Thomas Industries Inc. Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed July1, 2005 Dollars in thousands

goodwill amount is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.   
Other Consummated Acquisitions In June 2005, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of
Bottarini S.p.A. Bottarini, a packager of
industrial air compressors located near Milan, Italy.
Bottarinis products are complementary to the Compressor
and Vacuum Products segments product portfolio. The
purchase price of
81million
approximately $101million, including assumed bank debt
net of cash acquired and direct acquisition costs, was paid in
cash and the assumption of Bottarinis outstanding debt of
09million.
The size of this acquisition was not material in relation to
Gardner Denver. On September1, 2004, the Company acquired nash_elmo
Holdings, LLC Nash Elmo, a leading global
manufacturer of industrial vacuum pumps. Nash Elmo is primarily
split between two businesses, liquid ring pumps and side channel
blowers. Both businesses products are complementary to the
Compressor and Vacuum Products segments product portfolio.
Nash Elmo, previously headquartered in Trumbull, Connecticut,
has primary manufacturing facilities located in Bad Neustadt and
Nuremberg, Germany; Zibo, China; and Campinas, Brazil. The
purchase price of $2246million, including assumed bank
debt net of cash acquired and direct acquisition costs, was
paid in the form of cash and the assumption of certain of Nash
Elmos existing debt $104million. There are no
additional contingent payments or commitments related to this
acquisition. During 2005, the Company finalized the allocation
of the Nash Elmo purchase price. Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets and
liabilities of Nash Elmo were recorded at their respective fair
values as of September1, 2004. The initial allocation of
the purchase price was subsequently adjusted when preliminary
valuation estimates were finalized. The following table
summarizes the nature and amount of such adjustments recorded in
2005. There were no material adjustments to the value of
identifiable intangible assets.

Includes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes On January2, 2004, the Company acquired the outstanding
shares of Syltone plc Syltone, previously a
publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Syltone, previously headquartered in Bradford, England, is one
of the worlds largest manufacturers of equipment used for
loading and unloading liquid and dry bulk products on commercial
transportation vehicles. This equipment includes compressors,
blowers and other ancillary products that are complementary to
the Companys product lines. Syltone is also one of the
worlds largest manufacturers of fluid transfer equipment
including loading arms, swivel joints, couplers and valves
used to load and unload ships, tank trucks and rail cars. The
purchase price of 630million or approximately
$1125million, including assumed bank debt net of cash
acquired and direct acquisition costs, was paid in the form of
cash 463million, new loan notes
52million and the assumption of Syltones
existing bank debt, net of cash acquired
115million. There are no additional contingent
payments or commitments related to this acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the
years ended December31, 2005 and 2004, assumes that the
Thomas and Nash Elmo acquisitions had been completed as of
January1, 2004. This unaudited pro forma financial
information is subject to change upon finalization of the
purchase price 45 allocation of Thomas. The pro forma results have been prepared
for comparative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative
of the results of operations which may occur in the future or
that would have occurred had the Thomas and Nash Elmo
acquisitions been consummated on the date indicated.

one-time gain of $1604million, pre-tax, related to
Thomas sale of its equity interest in the Genlyte Thomas
Group LLC GTG on July31, 2004. Assuming that
Thomas had sold its interest in GTG on January1, 2004, and
had not generated this one-time gain, and used a portion of the
net proceeds from the sale to repay all of Thomas existing
debt, other than capitalized lease obligations, diluted pro
forma earnings per share for 2004 would have been $171.     2
Net income for 2005 and 2004 reflect the negative impact of
recording $39million and $36million, respectively,
in inventory pre-tax
step-up adjustments
relating to recording the Thomas and Nash Elmo inventories,
respectively, at fair value. All acquisitions have been accounted for by the purchase method
and, accordingly, their results are included in the
Companys consolidated financial statements from the
respective dates of acquisition. Under the purchase method, the
purchase price is allocated based on the fair value of assets
received and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.   
Thomas Merger-related Costs In connection with the consummation of the Thomas acquisition,
the Company accrued certain merger-related expenses primarily
related to estimated personnel-related costs. In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF No95-3,
Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination, the amount of the
liability was included in the allocation of Thomas
acquisition cost. The majority of the remaining accrual at
December31, 2005 is expected to be utilized in 2006. The
following table summarizes activity with respect to the accrued
liability.

During 2005, the amount of inventories accounted for on a LIFO
basis increased, which resulted in the creation of new LIFO
layers. During 2004 and 2003, reductions in inventory quantities
net of acquisitions resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory
layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The
effect was to increase net income in 2004 and 2003 by $94 and
$249, respectively. It is the Companys policy to record
the earnings effect of LIFO inventory liquidations in the
quarter in which a decrease for the entire year becomes certain.
In both 2004 and 2003, the LIFO liquidation income was recorded
in the fourth quarter. The Company believes that FIFO costs in
the aggregate approximates replacement or current cost and,
thus, the excess of replacement or current cost over LIFO value
was $63million and $48million as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Note5:Property, Plant and Equipment

Note6:Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets As discussed in Note1 Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, the Company has adopted
SFASNo142. Adoption required, among other things,
the discontinuation of goodwill amortization, assignment of
goodwill to reporting units, and completion of a transitional
goodwill impairment test. Substantially all goodwill was
assigned to the reporting unit that acquired the business. Under
the impairment test, if a reporting units carrying amount
exceeds its estimated fair value, a goodwill impairment is
recognized to the extent that the reporting units carrying
amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the
goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit was estimated
using available information regarding expected future cash flows
and a discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital
specific to the Company. During the second quarter of 2005, the
Company completed its annual impairment test and determined that
no impairment existed. 47 The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to
each business segment for the years ended December31, 2005
and 2004 are as follows

The outstanding balance was paid during 2005.   2
The loans under this facility may be denominated in
U.S.dollars or several foreign currencies. At
December31, 2005, the outstanding balance consisted of
U.S.dollar borrowings of $25,000, Euro borrowings of
90,000, and
British pound borrowings of 16,000. The interest rates
under the facility are based on prime, federal funds and/or
LIBOR for the applicable currency. The weighted-average interest
rates were 61%, 40% and 63%, as of December31, 2005 for
the U.S.dollar, Euro and British pound loans,
respectively. The interest rates averaged 47%, 39% and 63   for the year ended December31, 2005 for the
U.S.dollar, Euro and British pound loans, respectively.   3
The interest rate varies with prime, federal funds, and/or
LIBOR. At December31, 2005, this rate was 61% and
averaged 53% for the year ended December31, 2005.   4
This amount consists of two fixed-rate commercial loans assumed
in the 2004 acquisition of Nash Elmo with an outstanding balance
of 7,521 at
December31, 2005. The loans are secured by the
Companys facility in Bad Neustadt, Germany and are net of
unamortized discount of
237. At
December31, 2005, the weighted-average interest rate of
these mortgages was 46% and the weighted-average maturity was
14years.     5
The interest rate varies with market rates for tax-exempt
industrial revenue bonds. At December31, 2005, this rate
was 36% and averaged 25% for the year ended December31,
2005. These industrial revenue bonds are secured by an $8,100
standby letter of credit. The proceeds from the bonds were used
to construct the Companys Peachtree City, Georgia facility.   6
The term loan outstanding at December31, 2004 was replaced
with a new term loan on July1, 2005 under the new 2005
Credit Agreement. On July1, 2005, the Companys $6050million
amended and restated credit agreement the 2005 Credit
Agreement became effective with the Thomas acquisition.
The 2005 Credit Agreement provided the Company with access to
senior secured credit facilities, including a
$3800million Term Loan, and restated its
$2250million Revolving Line of Credit, superceding the
Companys previously existing credit agreement. Proceeds
from the 2005 Credit Agreement were used to fund the Thomas
acquisition and retire $1444million of debt outstanding
under the previously existing term loan. 49 The new Term Loan has a final maturity of July1, 2010. The
Term Loan requires quarterly principal payments aggregating
$20million, $33million, $52million 91million and $59million in 2006 through 2010,
respectively. The Revolving Line of Credit matures on September1, 2009.
Loans under this facility may be denominated in
U.S.dollars or several foreign currencies and may be
borrowed by the Company or two of its foreign subsidiaries as
outlined in the 2005 Credit Agreement. On December31,
2005, the Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding principal
balance of $1589million, leaving $661million
available for letters of credit or for future use, subject to
the terms of the Revolving Line of Credit. The interest rates applicable to loans under the 2005 Credit
Agreement are variable and will be, at the Companys
option, either the prime rate plus an applicable margin or LIBOR
plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin percentages are
adjustable quarterly, based upon financial ratio guidelines
defined in the 2005 Credit Agreement. The Company uses interest
rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to variability in
future LIBOR-based interest payments on variable-rate debt see
Note13 Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Concentrations of
Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments. The Companys obligations under the 2005 Credit Agreement
are guaranteed by the Companys existing and future
domestic subsidiaries, and are secured by a pledge of certain
subsidiaries capital stock. The Company is subject to
customary covenants regarding certain earnings, liquidity and
capital ratios. In May 2005, the Company completed an offering of
$1250million of its 8%Senior Subordinated Notes in
a private placement the Private Notes. The Company
used the proceeds from the Private Notes, proceeds from the
issuance of common stock in May 2005 and funds available under
the 2005 Credit Agreement, to finance its acquisition of Thomas
in July 2005 and to repay certain indebtedness. In an exchange
offer completed in November 2005, all of the Private Notes were
exchanged for notes with identical terms that are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 the Notes. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 8% and are
guaranteed by certain of the Companys domestic
subsidiaries. At any time prior to May1, 2009, the Company
may redeem all or part of the Notes issued under the Indenture
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of
the Notes redeemed plus an applicable premium in the range of 1%
to 4% of the principal amount, and accrued and unpaid interest
and liquidated damages, if any. In addition, at any time prior
to May1, 2008, the Company may, on one or more occasions,
redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
at a redemption price of 108% of the principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages, if any, with
the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings, subject
to certain conditions. On or after May1, 2009, the Company
may redeem all or a part of the Notes at varying redemption
prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages,
if any. Upon a change of control, as defined in the Indenture,
the Company is required to offer to purchase all of the Notes
then outstanding for cash at 101% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages,
if any. The Indenture contains events of default and
affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for such
financings, including, among other things, limits on incurring
additional debt and restricted payments. Debt maturities for the five years subsequent to
December31, 2005 and thereafter, are $26,081, $33,644 53,158, $251,246, $59,664 and $144,929, respectively. Cash paid for interest in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $25,951 7,817 and $4,498 respectively. The rentals for all operating leases were $15,954, $7,814, and
$3,818 in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Future minimum
rental payments for operating leases for the five years
subsequent to December31, 2005 and thereafter are $13,677 9,940, $7,625, $5,454, $3,618 and $12,686, respectively. 50 Note9:Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefits The Company sponsors retirement plans covering substantially all
worldwide employees. Benefits are provided to employees under
defined benefit pay-related and service-related plans, which are
generally noncontributory in the U.S. and Germany and are
generally contributory in the United Kingdom. Annual Company
contributions to U.S.retirement plans equal or exceed the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974. Effective July1, 2005, the Company completed its
acquisition of Thomas. Thomas sponsors a number of defined
benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The defined
benefit plans are noncontributory, service-related plans
benefiting hourly employees of Thomas in the United States and
Germany. In addition, Thomas sponsors two post-retirement
welfare plans. In accordance with SFAS87,
Employers Accounting for Pensions, and
SFAS106, Employers Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions the
Company has used the purchase accounting method to record the
liabilities related to these plans. The majority of the employees of the Companys
Belliss Morcom operations, acquired in 2001, are
based in the United Kingdom and are provided retirement benefits
under a contributory defined benefit pay and service-related
plan. Under the Companys purchase agreement, these
employees were allowed to continue to participate in the
sellers benefit plan for a period of up to one year from
the acquisition date. Within this one-year timeframe, the
Company established a similar retirement plan arrangement
allowing employees the option of transferring their accumulated
benefit. The purchase agreement also required the seller to
transfer plan assets in excess of the transferred accumulated
benefit obligation. During 2003, the Company settled this
receivable, resulting in adjustments to the benefit obligation
and fair value of plan assets for
non-U.S.pension
plans. Participation in this plan was frozen as of
January1, 2004. Employees hired after that date
participate in a contributory defined contribution plan. The majority of the employees of the Companys Syltone
operations, acquired in 2004, are based in the United Kingdom
and Germany. In the United Kingdom, the majority of these
employees are provided benefits under a contributory defined
benefit pay and service-related plan. Participation in this plan
was frozen as of July1, 2003. Employees hired after that
date participate in a contributory defined contribution plan. In
Germany employees are provided benefits under either a
non-contributory defined benefit pay and service-related plan or
under a contributory defined contribution plan. The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans. Benefits
are determined and funded annually based on terms of the plans
or as stipulated in a collective bargaining agreement. Certain
of the Companys full-time salaried and nonunion hourly
employees in the U.S.are eligible to participate in
Company-sponsored defined contribution savings plans, which are
qualified plans under the requirements of Section401k of
the Internal Revenue Code. The Companys matching
contributions to the savings plans are in the form of the
Companys common stock and cash. Thomas sponsors comparable
defined contribution plans for eligible employees of Thomas. The full-time salaried and hourly employees of the
Companys operations in Finland have pension benefits which
are guaranteed by the Finnish government. Although the plans are
similar to defined benefit plans, the government guarantee
feature causes the substance of the plans to be defined
contribution. Therefore, the discounted future liability of
these plans is not included in the liability for defined benefit
plans, but the expense for the Companys contribution is
included in the pension benefit cost for defined contribution
plans. Certain salaried employees in the U.S.who retired prior to
1989, as well as certain other employees who were near
retirement and elected to receive certain benefits, and certain
Nash Elmo and Thomas employees, have retiree medical,
prescription and life insurance benefits. In most cases, the
Nash Elmo retirees pay the entire cost of their coverage. The
hourly employees have separate plans with varying benefit
formulas. In all cases, however, no currently active hourly
employee, except for certain employees who are near retirement
and certain Thomas employees, will receive healthcare benefits
after retirement. As of January1, 2006, certain salaried
and non-union hourly employees will be eligible for
postretirement medical benefits whereby the retirees pay the
entire cost of the coverage. All of the Companys
postretirement medical plans are unfunded. 51 The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in
both the pension and other postretirement plans benefit
obligations and fair value of assets over the two-year period
ended December31, 2005, and a statement of the funded

The primary objectives for the investment of pension plan assets
are to secure participant retirement benefits and to minimize
reliance on contributions as a source of benefit security. Plan
assets are invested consistent with the provisions of prudence
and diversification rules of ERISA and with a long-term
investment horizon. The expected return on plan assets
assumption is determined by reviewing the actual investment
return of the plans since inception and evaluating those returns
in relation to expectations of various investment organizations
to determine whether long-term future returns are expected to
differ significantly from the past. The following table reflects the estimated benefit payments
reflecting expected future service for the next five years and
for the years 2011 through 2015. The estimated benefit payments
for the
non-U.S.pension
plans were calculated using foreign exchange rates as of
December31, 2005.

None of the plan assets of Gardner Denvers defined benefit
plans are invested in the Companys common stock. 55 Note10:Stockholders Equity and Earnings Per
Share At December31, 2005 and 2004, 50,000,000shares of
$001par value common stock and 10,000,000shares of
$001par value preferred stock were authorized. Shares of
common stock outstanding at December31, 2005 and 2004 were
25,999,352 and 19,947,570, respectively. No shares of preferred
stock were issued or outstanding at December31, 2005 or
2004. The shares of preferred stock, which may be issued without
further stockholder approval except as may be required by
applicable law or stock exchange rules, may be issued in one or
more series, with the number of shares of each series and the
rights, preferences and limitations of each series to be
determined by the Board of Directors. The Company has a
Stockholders Rights Plan, under which each share of
Gardner Denvers outstanding common stock has an associated
preferred share purchase right. The rights are exercisable only
under certain circumstances and allow holders of such rights to
purchase common stock of Gardner Denver or an acquiring company
at a discounted price, which generally would be 50% of the
respective stocks current fair market value. The following table details the calculation of basic and diluted

As of December31, 2005, Gardner Denver has net operating
loss carryforwards from various jurisdictions of
$294million that result in a deferred tax asset of
$97million. It is more likely than not that a portion of
these tax loss carryforwards will not produce future benefits
and a valuation allowance of $58million has been
established with respect to these losses. The expected
expiration dates of the tax loss carryforwards are as follows:
5years, $68million, 5 to 10years 74million, 10 to 20years, $49million and
$103million have no expiration date. The reversal of the
valuation allowance will reduce goodwill. 57 U.S.deferred income taxes have not been provided on
certain undistributed earnings of
non-U.S.subsidiaries
approximately $1015million at December31, 2005 as
the Company intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely or
distribute them only when available foreign tax credits could
significantly reduce the amount of U.S.taxes due on such
distributions. On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act the
AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company recognized a
charge of $11million, net of the amount provided for in
2004, for the accrual of income taxes associated with the
repatriation under the AJCA of approximately $185million
of foreign earnings. In addition, the Company repatriated
approximately $62million of cash from the acquired Thomas
foreign subsidiaries. As of the date of acquisition, the Company
determined that the repatriated earnings from the Thomas foreign
subsidiaries were no longer permanently reinvested. Net of
foreign tax credits, the tax liability associated with the
repatriation of these earnings is approximately $1million. Cash paid for income taxes in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $19,935 8,031 and $5,220, respectively. Note12:Stock-Based Compensation Plans Under the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan the
Incentive Plan, designated employees are eligible
to receive awards in the form of stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock awards or performance
shares, as determined by the Management Development and
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Gardner
Denvers Incentive Plan is intended to assist the Company
in recruiting and retaining employees and directors, and to
associate the interests of eligible participants with those of
Gardner Denver and its shareholders. An aggregate of
4,250,000shares of common stock has been authorized for
issuance under the Incentive Plan. Through December31,
2005, the Company has granted options on 3,924,409shares.
Under the Incentive Plan, the option exercise price equals the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
Under the terms of existing awards, one-third of employee
options granted become vested and exercisable on each of the
first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The options
granted to employees in 2003 expire ten years after the date of
grant. The options granted to employees in 2005 and 2004 expire
seven years after the date of grant. Pursuant to the Incentive Plan, each nonemployee director was
granted an option to purchase4,500shares of common
stock on the day after the 2005, 2004 and 2003 annual meeting of
stockholders. These options were granted at the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant, become
exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant or
upon retirement, death or cessation of service due to
disability, if earlier and expire five years after the date of
grant. The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan the
Stock Purchase Plan, a qualified plan under the
requirements of Section423 of the Internal Revenue Code,
and has reserved 1,150,000shares for issuance under this
plan. The Stock Purchase Plan requires participants to have the
purchase price of their options withheld from their pay over a
one-year period. In November 2000, the Stock Purchase Plan was
amended to permit eligible employees to purchase shares at the
lesser of 85% of the fair market price of the common stock on
either the offering date or the exercise date. The exercise date
for the 2000 offering was January2, 2002, at which time
employees elected to purchase68,323shares at an
offering price of $1536per share, 85% of the fair market
price on the offering date. In November 2001, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to
eligible employees under the same provisions as the 2000
offering. The exercise date for the 2001 offering was
January2, 2003, at which time employees elected to
purchase46,460shares at an offering price of
$1708per share, 85% of the fair market price on the
exercise date. In November 2002, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to
eligible employees under the same provisions as the 2000
offering. The exercise date for the 2002 offering was
January2, 2004, at which time employees 58 elected to purchase94,965shares at an offering price
of $1272per share, 85% of the fair market price on the
offering date. In November 2003, the Stock Purchase Plan was offered to
eligible employees under the same provisions as the 2000
offering. The exercise date for the 2003 offering was
January3, 2005, at which time employees elected to
purchase69,548shares at an offering price of
$1819per share, 85% of the fair market price on the
offering date. No additional options were offered to employees under the Stock
Purchase Plan in 2004 or 2005. A summary of the status of the Companys Incentive Plan at

Note13: Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Concentrations of
Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk There were no off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments
as of December31, 2005 or 2004. Credit risk related to derivatives arises when amounts
receivable from a counterparty exceed those payable. Because the
notional amount of the instruments only serves as a basis for
calculating amounts receivable or payable, the risk of loss with
any counterparty is limited to a small fraction of the notional
amount. Gardner Denver deals only with derivative counterparties
that are major financial institutions with investment-grade
credit ratings. All of the derivative contracts to which the
Company is a party settle monthly or quarterly, or mature within
one year. Because of these factors, the Company has minimal
credit risk related to derivative contracts at December31,
2005 and 2004. 59 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables
are limited due to the wide variety of customers and industries
to which the Companys products are sold, as well as their
dispersion across many different geographic areas. As a result,
the Company does not consider itself to have any significant
concentrations of credit risk at December31, 2005. Fair Value of Financial Instruments A financial instrument is defined as cash, evidence of an
ownership interest in an entity or a contract that creates a
contractual obligation or right to deliver or receive cash or
another financial instrument from another party. The
Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash
and equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and debt
instruments. The book values of these instruments are a
reasonable estimate of their respective fair values. The Company selectively uses derivative financial instruments to
manage interest costs and currency exchange risks. The Company
does not hold derivatives for trading purposes. The fair values
of derivative financial instruments are determined based on
dealer quotes. To effectively manage interest costs, the Company utilizes
interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt.
Also as part of its hedging strategy, the Company utilizes
purchased option and forward exchange contracts as cash flow
hedges to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on
transactions, cash flows and firm commitments. These contracts
for the sale or purchase of European and other currencies
generally mature within one year. The following is a summary of the notional transaction amounts
and fair values for the Companys outstanding derivative
financial instruments by risk category and instrument type, as
of December31, 2005 and 2004. Fair values of the
derivatives do not consider the offsetting underlying hedged
item.

Note14: Contingencies The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, lawsuits
and administrative actions, which are of an ordinary or routine
nature. In addition, due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos
manufacturers and other primary defendants, among other things,
the Company has been named as a defendant in an increasing
number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits. The Company has
also been named as a defendant in an increasing number of
silicosis personal injury lawsuits. The plaintiffs in these
suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple
sources and typically the Company is one of approximately 25 or
more named defendants. In the Companys experience, the
vast majority of the plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease
for which the Company bears any responsibility. Predecessors to the Company sometimes manufactured, distributed
and/or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos
and silicosis litigation lawsuits the Products.
However, neither the Company nor its predecessors ever mined,
manufactured, mixed, produced or distributed asbestos fiber or
silica sand, the materials that allegedly caused the injury
underlying the lawsuits. Moreover, the asbestos-containing
components of the Products were enclosed within the subject
Products. The Company has entered into a series of cost-sharing agreements
with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for
asbestos and silicosis lawsuits. The Company also believes some
of the potential liabilities 60 regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements
with other parties. The Companys uninsured settlement
payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have been
immaterial. The Company believes that the pending and future asbestos and
silicosis lawsuits will not, in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or liquidity, based on: the Companys
anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the
risks of such matters; the limited potential asbestos exposure
from the components described above; the Companys
experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired
with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or
silica from or relating to the Products or for which the Company
otherwise bears responsibility; various potential defenses
available to the Company with respect to such matters; and the
Companys prior disposition of comparable matters. However,
due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future
developments, including, without limitation, potential
insolvencies of insurance companies, could cause a different
outcome, there can be no assurance that the resolution of
pending or future lawsuits, whether by judgment, settlement or
dismissal, will not have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. The Company has also been identified as a potentially
responsible party with respect to several sites designated for
environmental cleanup under various state and federal laws. The
Company does not believe that the future potential costs related
to these sites will have a material adverse effect on its
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity. Note15: Segment Information As a result of the acquisition of Thomas, certain changes were
made to Gardner Denvers organizational structure. The
Companys new organizational structure is still
fundamentally based on the products and services the Company
offers. In 2002, Thomas acquired Werner Rietschle Holding GmbH
Rietschle, a privately held company based in
Germany. Prior to this acquisition, Thomas was considered a
leader in the production of oil-free compressors, vacuum pumps
and liquid pumps for OEMs. Rietschle products primarily include
dry and oil-lubricated vacuum pumps, compressors and blowers,
which utilize similar technologies and serve similar markets as
the Companys Blower Division. Due to these distinct
similarities, Rietschle was combined with the Companys
Blower Division. The original Thomas business is now operated
and managed as the Companys Thomas Products Division. Subsequent to the acquisition of Thomas, Gardner Denver now has
five operating divisions: Compressor, Blower, Liquid Ring Pump,
Fluid Transfer and Thomas Products. These divisions comprise two
reportable segments: Compressor and Vacuum Products formerly
Compressed Air Products and Fluid Transfer Products. The
Compressor, Blower, Liquid Ring Pump and Thomas Products
Divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment Compressor
and Vacuum Products since the long-term financial performance
of these businesses are affected by similar economic conditions,
coupled with the similar nature of their products, manufacturing
processes and other business characteristics. During the third
quarter of 2004, the Companys former Pump and Fluid
Transfer Divisions which consisted of the Syltone fluid
transfer-related activities were combined into one division,
Fluid Transfer. These two divisions were previously aggregated
into one reportable segment Fluid Transfer Products primarily
due to the same factors noted above, and thus, there has been no
change to the Fluid Transfer Products segment. In the Compressor and Vacuum Products segment, the Company
designs, manufactures, markets and services the following
products and related aftermarket parts for industrial and
commercial applications: rotary screw, reciprocating, sliding
vane and centrifugal compressors; positive displacement,
centrifugal and side channel blowers; and liquid ring pumps and
engineered systems. With the acquisition of Thomas, the product
range now also includes single-piece piston reciprocating,
diaphragm, and linear compressor and vacuum pumps primarily
serving OEM applications. Stationary air compressors are used in
manufacturing, process applications and materials handling, and
to power air tools and equipment. Blowers are used primarily in
pneumatic conveying, wastewater aeration, numerous applications
in industrial manufacturing and engineered vacuum systems.
Liquid ring pumps are used in many different vacuum applications
and engineered systems, such as 61 water removal, distilling, reacting, efficiency improvement,
lifting and handling, and filtering, principally in the pulp and
paper, industrial manufacturing, chemical and power industries.
The markets served are primarily in the United States, Europe,
Canada and Asia. In the Fluid Transfer Products segment, the Company designs,
manufactures, markets and services a diverse group of pumps,
water jetting systems and related aftermarket parts used in oil
and natural gas well drilling, servicing and production and in
industrial cleaning and maintenance. This segment also designs,
manufactures, markets and services other fluid transfer
components and equipment for the chemical, petroleum and food
industries. The markets served are primarily the United States,
Europe, Canada and Asia. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
described in Note1 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies. The Company evaluates the performance of its
segments based on income before interest expense, other income,
net and income taxes. Certain assets attributable to corporate
activity are not allocated to the segments. General corporate
assets unallocated assets consist of cash and equivalents and
deferred tax assets. Intersegment sales and transfers are not
significant. Summarized information about the Companys operations by
business segment and by geographic area follows

The quarter ended March31, 2004 includes $846 from an
unrealized foreign currency transaction gain.     3
The quarter ended December31, 2004 includes the favorable
impact of $939 stemming from an adjustment to depreciation and
amortization expense due to finalizing the purchase price
allocation for the Syltone acquisition. In addition, the
effective income tax rate for the quarter ended
December31, 2004 was 183% due to net favorable income tax
reductions that lowered the effective rate for the full year to
290%, compared to 320% for the prior year quarter and full
year. The effective tax rate for each quarter of 2005 was 30%. 69 Gardner Denver, Inc. common stock trades on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker symbol GDI. Note18:Subsequent Events Unaudited On January9, 2006, the Company completed the acquisition
of the Todo Group Todo, for a purchase price of
1185million Swedish kronor approximately
$15million, net of debt and cash acquired. Todo, with
assembly operations in Sweden and the United Kingdom, and a
central European sales and distribution operation in the
Netherlands, has one of the most extensive offerings of
dry-break couplers in the industry. TODO-MATIC
self-sealing couplings are used by many of the worlds
largest oil, chemical and gas companies to safely and
efficiently transfer their products. The Todo acquisition
extends the Companys product line of Emco Wheaton
couplers, added as part of the Syltone acquisition in 2004,
and strengthens the distribution of each companys products
throughout the world. On February21, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors
approved an amendment to the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation, subject to stockholder approval, which would
increase the number of shares of common stock that the Company
has authority to issue from 50,000,000shares to
100,000,000shares. The Board directed that the amendment
be submitted for consideration and approval by the
Companys stockholders at the Companys Annual Meeting
of Stockholders on May2, 2006. On February21, 2006,
the Board also approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of
a stock dividend, subject to the approval of the amendment of
the Certificate of Incorporation by the stockholders of the
Company. In the event that stockholder approval of the proposed
amendment is obtained, the two-for-one stock split in the form
of a stock dividend is expected to become effective on or about
June1, 2006, with each stockholder of record at the close
of business on the record date for the stock dividend,
May11, 2006, being entitled to receive one additional
share of common stock for every share of common stock so held.
Information concerning the stock split is available under
