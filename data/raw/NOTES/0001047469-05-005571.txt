The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Merge Technologies Incorporated: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Merge Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Merge Technologies Incorporated and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31,
2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Merge Technologies Incorporated internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report dated March4, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over

34  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Merge Technologies Incorporated: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying report on internal control over financial reporting in Item9A of Form10-K, that Merge
Technologies Incorporated the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Merge Technologies
Incorporated management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In
our opinion, management assessment that Merge Technologies Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, Merge Technologies Incorporated maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Merge Technologies
Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December31, 2004, and our report dated March4, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/

1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
aNature of Operations 
We are in the business of integrating radiology images and information into healthcare enterprise networks. Our products and services enhance the quality of
healthcare provided to patients because they improve radiology workflow efficiencies, reduce healthcare operating costs and improve clinical decision making processes. We deliver this tangible value
both to OEM/VARs and directly to healthcare facilities of all sizes, but we specifically target small to medium size hospitals, multi-hospital groups, clinics and diagnostic imaging centers, by
working with our customers to offer modular, cost effective solutions to solve their image and information management and radiology workflow needs. 
bPrinciples of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include our financial statements and our wholly owned subsidiaries, eFilm Medical,Inc.,
RISLogic,Inc. and Merge TechnologiesK.K. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. cInventory 
Inventory, consisting principally of raw materials and finished goods, is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out method. 
dProperty and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. 
Depreciation
on property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Useful lives of our major classes of property
and equipment are: three years for computer equipment and seven years for office equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated life of the asset or the term of the lease. 
ePurchased and Developed Software 
All research and development costs incurred prior to the point at which management believes a project has reached technological feasibility are expensed as
incurred. Software development costs incurred subsequent to reaching technological feasibility are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value in accordance with
SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. Amortization of purchased and developed
software is provided on a product-by-product basis over the expected economic life of the related software, generally five years, using the straight-line method.
This method results in greater amortization than the method based on the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that
product. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we capitalized software development costs of $3,479, $2,674, and $1,850, respectively. Amortization expense related to purchased and developed software for 2004,
2003 and 2002, was $2,881, $2,046, and $1,344, respectively. 
41  We
assess the recoverability of these costs periodically by determining whether the unamortized capitalized costs can be recovered through future net operating cash flows through the
sale of that product. 
fFair Value of Financial Instruments 
Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. The carrying amounts
approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term receivables is not materially different from the fair value. 
gLong-Lived Assets 
We account for long-lived assets in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. Other long-term assets, including property and equipment, and other intangibles, are amortized over their expected lives, which are
estimated by management. Management also makes estimates of the impairment of long-term assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. If the actual useful life of a long-term asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us, the assets may be deemed to be impaired and, accordingly, a
write-down of the value of the assets or a shorter amortization period may be required. We have reviewed long-lived assets and certain intangible assets with estimable useful
lives and determined that their carrying values as of December31, 2004 are recoverable in future periods. 
hGoodwill and Other Intangibles 
Effective January1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No142 and SFAS No141, Business Combinations
SFAS No141. SFAS No141 specifies criteria for recognizing and reporting intangible assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be tested for impairment at least annually. 
As
of the date of adoption of SFAS No142, we have discontinued amortization of all existing goodwill. Additionally, pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No141, we
substantiated our recorded purchased software as intangible assets that must be recognized apart from goodwill and amortized over its estimated useful lives of three to five years. Our
intangible assets, other than developed software, subject to amortization are summarized as follows: Weighted Average Remaining Amortization PeriodYears
December31, 2004
December31, 2003 Gross Carrying Amount
Accumulated Amortization
Gross Carrying Amount
Accumulated Amortization Purchased software

30 1,943 760 1,943 371 Total
29 4,844 1,990 4,844 1,016 42 
Amortization expense was $974, $693, and $261 for the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next
five years is as follows: For the year ended 2005 935 2006 924 2007 708 2008 287 2009 The provisions of SFAS No142 require that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested at least annually for impairment or
when indicators of potential impairment exist, using a fair value based approach. We continue to monitor the carrying value of goodwill through annual impairment tests. At December31, 2004, we
performed our annual impairment tests and found none of our goodwill to be impaired. 
During
2004, we reduced goodwill by $496 to reflect adjustments made to the RIS Logic tax assets prior to our acquisition and $183 due to the refund of Canadian tax credits associated
with software development efforts related to periods prior to our acquisitions of eFilm and Interpra Medical Imaging NetworkLtd. Interpra. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill
for the year ended December31, 2004, are as follows: Balance as of January1, 2004 21,846 Goodwill adjustments 679 Balance as of December31, 2004 21,167 iWarranties 
We provide twelve months of hardware warranty on our sales. We have provided for expected hardware warranty costs based on our historical experience. Accrued
warranty was $17, $67 and $67 at December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The adjustment in the accrual during 2004 of $50 is attributed to a reduction of expected costs due to decreased
sales in the OEM sales channel and is reflected in cost of goods soldsoftware and other. jGuarantees 
Effective January1, 2003, we adopted FIN No45. FIN No45 requires that we recognize the fair value for guarantee and indemnification
arrangements issued or modified by us after December31, 2002, if these arrangements are within the scope of the interpretation. In addition, we must continue to monitor the conditions that are
subject to the guarantees and indemnifications, as required under the previously existing generally accepted accounting principles, in order to identify if a loss has occurred. If we determine it is
probable that a loss has occurred, then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications. Under our standard Software License, Services and Maintenance
Agreement, we agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses, damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees' use of our software infringes
the intellectual property rights of a third party. Historically, we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions and, accordingly, we have
not recorded a liability relating to such provisions. Under our standard Software 
43  License,
Services and Maintenance Agreement, we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products operate substantially in accordance with published specifications, and that the
services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices. Historically, only minimal costs have been
incurred relating to the satisfaction of software product warranty claims and, as such, no accrual for software warranty claims has been made. Other guarantees include promises to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each of our executive officers, non-employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses, damages and costs incurred by each such individual in
administrative, legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf. Historically,
minimal costs have been incurred relating to such indemnifications and, as such, no accrual for these guarantees have been made. 
kIncome Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The
effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 
lNet Income Per Share 
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. We have made an
accounting policy election to use the if-converted method for convertible securities that participate in Common Stock dividends; however, the two-class method must be used if
the effect is more dilutive. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur based on the effect of the conversion of outstanding convertible preferred shares and the
exercise of stock options and warrants with an exercise price of less than the 
44  average
market price of our Common Stock. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Years Ended December31 2004

Stock had exercise prices greater than the average market price of the shares of our Common Stock and were excluded from the diluted net income per share calculation as their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive.

As of December31, 2004, we maintain three stock-based employee compensation plans and one director option plan, which are described more fully in
Note8. We apply the provisions of SFAS 
45  No123R,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended, which requires entities to recognize as expense over the vesting period the fair
value of all stock-based awards on the date of grant. Alternatively, SFAS No123R allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No25 and provide pro forma
disclosures as if the fair-value-based method defined in SFAS No123R had been applied.

have elected to continue to apply the provisions of APB Opinion No25 in accounting for our plans. All stock options under the plans have been granted at exercise prices of
not less than the market value at the date of grant, and as a result, no compensation expense has been recorded under APB Opinion No25. Had we determined compensation cost based on the fair
value at the grant date under SFAS No123R, our net income would have been decreased in 2004, 2003 and 2002 to the pro forma amounts indicated below: YearsEndedDecember31 2004

Revenues are derived primarily from the sublicensing and licensing of computer software, installations, training, consulting, software maintenance and sales of
PACS, RIS and RIS/PACS solutions. Inherent in the revenue recognition process are significant management estimates and judgments, which influence the timing and amount of revenue recognized. 
For
software arrangements, we recognize revenue according to SOP97-2, as amended. SOP No97-2, as amended, generally requires revenue earned on
software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements. Revenue from multiple-element software arrangements is recognized
using the residual method, pursuant to SOP No98-9. Under the residual method, revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement, but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. We allocate revenue to each undelivered
element in a multiple element arrangement based on its respective fair value, with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately. Specifically, we determine the
fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance offered to customers, which is stated in the contract, and fair value of the installation based
upon the price charged when the services are sold separately. If evidence of the 
46  fair
value cannot be established for undelivered elements of a software sale, the entire amount of revenue under the arrangement is deferred until these elements have been delivered or vendor-specific
objective evidence of fair value can be established. 
Revenue
from sublicenses sold on an individual basis and computer software licenses is recognized upon shipment provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and
risk of loss has passed to the customer, fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. 
Revenue
from software usage sublicenses sold through annual contracts and software maintenance is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue from installation,
training, and consulting services is recognized as services are performed. Revenue
from sales of RIS and from RIS/PACS solutions, where professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the solution sold, is recognized on the percentage of
completion method, as prescribed by AICPA SOP 81-1, Accounting for Performance on Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type
Contracts. Percentage of completion is determined by the input method based upon the amount of labor hours expended compared to the total estimated amount of labor hours to
complete the project. Total estimated labor hours is based on management best estimate of the total amount of time it takes to complete a project. These estimates require the use of judgment. A
significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract
values and estimated labor hours expended and reflect changes in estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch-up method. 
Our
policy is to allow returns when we have preauthorized the return. Based on our historical experience of a limited number of returns and our expectation that returns, if any, will be
insignificant, we have provided for an allowance for specific potential items only. 
oUse of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
pReclassifications 
Where appropriate, certain items relating to the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. qSegment Reporting 
In June1997, the FASB issued Statement No131. SFAS No131 establishes annual and interim reporting standards for operating segments of a
company. It also requires entity wide disclosures about the products and services an entity provides, the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues, and its major customers. We
are not organized by multiple operating segments for the purpose of making operating decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, we operate as one operating segment and report applicable
enterprise-wide disclosures. 
47  
rForeign Currency Translation 
We use the U. S. Dollar for financial reporting purposes as substantially all of our billings are in U. S. Dollars. The balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries
are translated into U. S. Dollars using the balance sheet date exchange rate, and revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation gains
and losses are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, as a component of other income
expense, net. 
sRecent Accounting Pronouncements 
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment. The new
pronouncement replaces the existing requirements under SFAS No123 and APB Opinion No25. According to SFAS No123R, all forms of share-based payments to employees, including
employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans, would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations. This pronouncement
eliminates the ability to account for stock-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No25 and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a
fair-value based method. For public companies, the FASB has determined that SFAS No123R is effective for awards and stock options granted, modified or settled in cash in interim
or annual periods beginning after June15, 2005. SFAS No123R provides transition alternatives for public companies to restate prior interim periods or prior years. We will adopt the
standard as of the effective date and are in the process of evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial statements. 2Acquisitions 
On July17, 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of RIS Logic pursuant to a merger agreement dated July9, 2003 for a total
purchase price of $16,984 consisting primarily of cash, vested
options and 771,804 shares of Common Stock. RIS Logic has been in the business of the development and sales of RIS products to end user imaging centers. 
We
paid a significant premium above the fair value of RIS Logic tangible net assets principally because we determined that RIS Logic software development ability and trade name are
particularly important to us. As we looked to the future, we foresaw the need to expand our software product offerings to healthcare institutions and imaging centers as many of our competitors are
developing more integrated solutions. In addition, we expect to be able to sell our software products to RIS Logic customers. The fair value of each share issued to RIS Logic was determined to be
$14305 using a four-day average of the closing price of our Common Stock before and after the signing of the definitive agreement. 
An
escrow of 173,093 shares of Common Stock was established as a reserve for 18months, which was extended and will terminate on March18, 2005, against any claims
regarding breaches or representations and warranties. 
On
June28, 2002, we acquired all the outstanding capital stock of eFilm pursuant to a stock acquisition agreement dated April15, 2002, for a total purchase price of
$8,360 consisting primarily of 1,000,000 exchangeable shares. eFilm has been in the business of development of medical imaging workflow products and services, developing innovative medical image
viewing and related solutions 
48  within
a clinical environment. Its assets included accounts receivable, inventory, capital equipment and intangible assets. 
We
paid a significant premium above the fair value of eFilm tangible net assets principally for two reasons: eFilm knowledge of our software products through the joint development
projects that were undertaken prior to the acquisition; and the ability to sell our products to existing eFilm customers. Also, eFilm software development ability is particularly important because
as we looked to the future, we foresaw the need to expand our software product offerings to healthcare institutions as many of our competitors are promising more integrated solutions. In addition, we
expected to be able to sell our higher price and high margin software products to eFilm customers and to use the eFilm Workstation as a way to have the healthcare institutions become
aware of us. The fair value of each exchangeable share issued in the eFilm acquisition was determined to be $7736, using a three-day average closing price of our Common Stock after
signing the definitive agreement. 
Each
holder of eFilm exchangeable shares has the right, at any time within five years of the acquisition date, to exchange their shares for our Common Stock on a
one-for-one-basis, subject to adjustment provisions. As of December31, 2004, all shares were converted to our Common Stock. 
We
also established an escrow holdback of 116,590 exchangeable shares for 18months for indemnification with respect to certain potential claims. The escrow holdback was released
during 2003. 
For
eFilm, the value assigned to acquired in-process technology was determined by identifying the acquired specific in-process research and development projects
that would be continued, and for which 1technological feasibility had not been established at the acquisition date, 2there was no alternative future use, and 3the fair
value was estimable with reasonable reliability. We estimated the fair value of the eFilm in-process research and development to be $148. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed
in the consolidated statement of operations upon the acquisition date. 
The
estimated fair value of the eFilm in-process research and development was determined by the utilization of the income or consumption approach. Appraisal assumptions
utilized under this method included a forecast of estimated future net cash flows, as well as discounting the future net cash flows to their present value. We used a 25% discount rate, which was
calculated using an industry beta and capital structure. 
In
May2002, we acquired certain assets of Aurora Technologies,Inc. Aurora pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement dated April18, 2002, for a total purchase
price of $917 consisting primarily of 93,901 shares of our Common Stock. Aurora was in the business of design, production and sale of diagnostic radiology products and software that facilitate the
viewing, distribution and storage of digital images. Its assets included accounts receivable, inventory, capital equipment and intangible assets. The fair value of shares issued to Aurora was
determined to be $843 per share. 
An
escrow holdback of 18,780 shares of Common Stock was established for 12months, for indemnification with respect to certain potential claims. The escrow holdback was released
in 2003. 
The
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The accompanying consolidated statements of operations include the results of operations for RIS Logic,
acquired on July17, 2003, for eFilm, acquired on June28, 2002, and for Aurora, acquired on May28, 2002, since the respective acquisition dates. The amounts allocated to
purchased and developed software are being amortized over periods ranging from three to five years. The estimated asset lives are determined based on projected future economic benefits and expected
life cycles of the technologies. The amounts 
49  assigned
to goodwill are not being amortized, but will be tested for impairment annually or under certain circumstances that may indicate a potential impairment. The following is a summary of purchase
consideration for the acquisitions: Form of Consideration

3Accounts Receivable 
Substantially all receivables are derived from sales and related support and maintenance of our products to healthcare providers located throughout the United
States of America and in certain foreign countries. 
Our
accounts receivable balance is reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide for an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts based upon historical experience
and management judgment. At the end of 2004 and 2003, the allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts was $497 and $374, respectively.

aLine of Credit 
In November2003, we negotiated a new unsecured revolving line of credit agreement with our bank, increasing our line to $15million from
$5million, effective November21, 2003, and maturing December31, 2006. The line is subject to covenants including financial covenants, as defined, with respect to minimum net
income, tangible net worth, current ratio, total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio, interest coverage ratio, and other customary covenants. The interest rate on the line of credit is at a
variable rate that is equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, less 075percentage points. At December31, 2004,
the loan interest rate was 45%. No amounts were outstanding on the line of credit as of December31, 2004. 
bNote Payable to Investor 
We had a $300 Canadian five year non-interest bearing note assumed in the 1999 acquisition of Interpra. This note was repaid in full during 2004. The
note was discounted to reflect the current interest rate of 8% at the time the note was assumed and the related discount was amortized over a five-year period. We recognized interest
expense related to this note of approximately $12, $16 and $13 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
5Employee Benefit Plan 
We maintain defined contribution retirement plans 401k profit sharing plan for the United States of America employees and RRSP for the Canadian employees
covering employees who meet the minimum service requirements and have elected to participate. We made our matching contribution under the 401k profit sharing plan for the United States of America
employees and DPSP for the Canadian employees equal to a maximum of 25% in 2004 and 2003, and 20% in 2002. Our matching contributions totaled $203, $112, and $77 for the years ended
December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
In
2004, we also accrued a discretionary profit sharing contribution of $120 to be contributed in 2005 under these plans. 
51  6Income Taxes 
The provision for income tax consists of the following for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. 2004
2003
2002 Current Federal 676 1,284 19 State 474 357 3 Foreign 119 149 95 Total current 1,269 1,790 79 Deferred Federal 623 642 State 217 551 Foreign 229 63 Total deferred 1,069 1,130 Total provision 2,338 660 79 Actual
income taxes vary from the expected income taxes computed by applying the statutory income tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes as a result of the following: Years Ended December 31 2004
2003
2002 Expected tax expense 3,432 2,415 1,261 Total increase decrease in income taxes resulting from Nondeductible amortization and acquired in-process technology 50 Change in the valuation allowance allocated to income tax expense 2,236 1,650 Extraterritorial income tax exclusion 1,457 Research and experimentation credit 108 134 40 Nondeductible expenses 53 42 85 Foreign withholding taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 100 558 State and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 449 117 204 Foreign rate differential 118 43 28 Other 13 59 141 Actual tax expense 2,338 660 79 In
2003, we increased our United States Federal statutory tax rate to 35% from 34%, which was applied in 2002, because we believe that 35% is expected to be the statutory rate at which
the deferred components will reverse in the future. 
52  
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December31,
2004 and 2003 are presented below: December 31 2004
2003 Deferred tax assets Accrued wages 124 206 Research and experimentation credit carry forwards 2,331 1,974 Other credit carry forwards 143 59 Net operating loss carry forwards 1,232 1,684 Foreign net operating loss carry forwards 283 710 Other 257 215 Total deferred tax assets 4,370 4,848 Deferred tax liabilities Software development costs and intangible assets 2,783 2,667 Intangiblescustomer contracts 479 594 Other 94 33 Total gross deferred liabilities 3,356 3,294 Net deferred taxes 1,014 1,554 Included on balance sheet Current assets: Deferred tax asset 3,076 3,541 Non-current liabilities: Deferred tax liability 2,062 1,987 Net deferred taxes 1,014 1,554 The
decrease in the valuation allowance for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, was $0, $2,660, and $1,269, respectively. Management has an obligation under SFAS
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to review, at least annually, the components of our deferred income taxes. This review is to ascertain
that, based upon the information available at the time of the preparation of financial statements; it is more likely than not, expected to utilize future deductions and credits. In the event that
management determines that it is more likely than not those future deductions or credits will not be utilized, a valuation allowance should be recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount
expected to be realized. Management analysis for 2004 determined that a valuation allowance was not needed at December31, 2004. This was the same conclusion reached during the 2003 annual
review. This decision was based upon many factors, both quantitative and qualitative, such as 1our four years of positive taxable income, before net operating loss deductions,
2expected future operating profitability, and 3the relatively long expiration periods of net operating losses and tax credits. However, fluctuations in the actual outcome of these
expectations could materially impact our tax expense and deferred tax assets in the future. Prior to 2003, it was determined that the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets was, based upon the
relatively low levels of historical taxable income at that time, not likely. The
income tax benefit of disqualifying dispositions of employee incentive stock options exercised during 2004 and 2003 in the amount of $595 and $1,657, respectively, was recorded in
additional paid in capital, and did not result in a benefit on the statements of operations. 
53  At
December31, 2004, we had federal net operating loss carry forwards and research credit carry forwards of $2,897 and $1,890, respectively, state net operating loss carry
forwards and research credit carry forwards of $3,945 and $441, respectively, and foreign federal and provincial net operating loss carry forwards of $169 and $1,963, respectively. 
These
losses and credits are available to offset future taxable income, and tax in the future. The federal net operating loss and research credit carry forwards expire at varying amounts
beginning in 2007 and 2005, respectively, and continue through 2021 and 2024, respectively. The state net operating loss and research credits carry forwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2015
and 2005, respectively, and continue through 2023 and 2019, respectively. The foreign federal and provincial net operating loss carry forwards expire in varying amounts beginning in 2007 and continue
through 2010. A portion of the income tax loss carry forwards and credits are subject to certain limitations, which could impair our ability to utilize the benefits of these losses and credits in the
future. In addition, if certain substantial changes in our ownership should occur, tax loss and credit carry forwards may be further limited. 
We
filea consolidated federal income tax return. 
7Leases 
We have a non-cancelable operating lease for our main office facility that expires in June2005. Total rent expense associated with this lease
for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, was approximately $324, $307 and $304, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with
initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year, as of December31, 2004, are: Operating 2005 740 2006 779 2007 774 2008 743 2009 573 Thereafter 1,352 Total minimum lease payments 4,961 In
November2004, we entered into an office lease for our new principal facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for approximately 22,000 square feet through April2011. The
payments due under this new lease are reflected in the table above. 
8Shareholders' Equity 
aCommon Stock 
During 2003, warrants to purchase 104,001 shares of Common Stock were exercised. In
July2003, we issued 771,804 shares of our Common Stock to the shareholders of RIS Logic to acquire 100% of their outstanding stock. We did not use any underwriters to complete
the transaction. The transaction was exempt from registration as a private offering under RegulationD and Section42 of the Securities Act. 
54  In
July2003, we sold 666,664 shares of our Common Stock in an offering exempt from registration as a non-public offering, which raised $8million of gross
proceeds before any expenses associated with the offering of these shares. The monies raised were for general corporate purposes. Fees of $240 and 35,000 shares of our Common Stock were paid to Belle
Haven Investments, L. P., a placement agent. All shares were sold in a non-public offering exempt under RegulationD and Section42 of the Securities Act and only to
persons who were accredited investors. 
On
August24, 2004, we announced a stock repurchase plan providing for the purchase of up to $10million of our Common Stock. Purchases may be made over a period of two
years and the timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors. As of December31, 2004, we have not made any repurchases
under this plan. 
bSpecial Voting Preferred Stock 
At the end of 2003, we had one share of our Special Voting Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The one share issued to our former transfer agent, served as a
trustee in voting matters on behalf of the Interpra exchangeable shareholders. As of December31, 2004, there were no Interpra exchangeable shares outstanding and the one share of Special
Voting Preferred Stock was retired. cSeries2 Special Voting Preferred Stock 
At the end of 2003, we had one share of Series2 Special Voting Preferred Stock issued to our former transfer agent, which served as a trustee in voting
matters on behalf of the eFilm exchangeable shareholders. As of December31, 2004, there were no eFilm exchangeable shares outstanding and the one share of Series2 Special Voting
Preferred Stock was retired. 
dSeriesA Preferred Stock  There were no transactions of SeriesA Preferred Stock during 2004. 
eStock Option Plan 
We maintain a stock option plan for our employees that provides for the grant of a maximum of 3,265,826 options to purchase shares of our Common Stock. Under this
plan, options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant. The majority of the options vest over a four-year period at 25% per year. The
majority of the options granted under this plan expire six years from the date of grant. At December31, 2004, there were 388,780 options available to grant. In
July2003, our Board of Directors adopted a stock option plan for the employees of RIS Logic that provides for the grant of a maximum of 300,000 options to purchase shares of
our Common Stock. Under the plan, 127,697 vested options were granted as rollover options as part of the acquisition agreement at an exercise price of $294 per share. An additional 148,500 options
were granted and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant, vest over a four year period at 25% per year and expire six years from the date of
grant. All options granted under this plan are considered non-statutory options under Section401a of the Internal Revenue Code. Any expired or forfeited options granted under
this plan are not eligible for reissuance. This plan does not allow for option grants after December31, 2003. 
55  
We also maintain a stock option plan for our non-employee directors, which provides for the granting of a maximum of 300,000 options to purchase
shares of our Common Stock. Under this plan, options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our Common Stock at the date of grant. The majority of options granted under this plan
fully vest at the date of grant. Any expired or forfeited options granted under this plan are not eligible for reissuance. The options granted under this plan expire ten years and one day from the
date of grant. At December31, 2004, there were 9,592 options available to grant.

We maintain an employee stock purchase plan that allowed employees during 2004 to purchase stock at the lesser of the stock price at the start of each calendar
quarter or the end of each calendar quarter. Contributions to the employee stock purchase plan are made through payroll deductions. During 2003 and 2002, employees purchased stock at 85% of the lesser
of the stock price at the start of the plan year or the end of each calendar quarter. Contributions to the employee stock purchase plan are made through payroll deductions. Employees contributed $68 153, and $76 during 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, to purchase shares of our Common Stock under the employee stock purchase plan. 
gWarrants

57  9Concentrations 
Substantially all of our cash is held at one financial institution located in the United States of America. Deposits held with the bank exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. 
The
majority of our clients are imaging centers, hospitals and integrated delivery networks. If significant adverse macro-economic factors were to impact these organizations, it could
materially adversely affect us. Our access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers. The inability of any supplier to fulfill our supply
requirements could affect future results. 
Foreign
sales, denominated in U. S. Dollars, accounted for approximately 23%, 37% and 38% of our net sales for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. For
the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, sales in foreign currency represented 9%, 3%, and 4%, respectively, of our net sales. 
We
maintain sales offices in Nuenen, the Netherlands and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the originating office of the related orders. Net sales
for the Netherlands sales office were approximately $4,821, $5,875 and $5,440 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Net sales for the sales office in Canada were
$2,748, $4,200 and $1,749 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Long-lived assets in service at the Nuenen and Toronto sales offices were not material
as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
Although
we maintain a sales office in Tokyo, Japan, orders from customers in Japan are processed in the United States of America and are considered United States of America based sales.
Long-lived assets in service at the Tokyo office were not material as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
For
the year ended December31, 2004, we had no individual customer that represented more than 10% of net sales. We had one customer that comprised 14% and 18% of net sales for
the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No individual customer represented 10% or more of accounts receivable at December31, 2004 or 2003. 
10Related Party Transactions 
In April2003, Richard A. Linden, President and Chief Executive Officer, repaid the remaining $25 note receivable for a stock subscription. 
11Subsequent Events 
In January2005, we closed our acquisition of AccuImage DiagnosticsInc., a leader in the development, marketing and support of software for
advanced visualization, analysis and management of medical imaging data from medical imaging modalities, including state-of-the-art multi-slice CT and MRI. The
transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with a purchase price of approximately $6million in cash, plus the assumption and payment of approximately
$1million of debt. 
In
January2005, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge in an all-stock transaction with Cedara Software Corp., a leading independent developer of
medical software technologies for the global healthcare market. We will issue either 0587 shares of our Common Stock, 
58  or
0587 shares of a newly created class of Canadian exchangeable shares for each share of Cedara common stock. The transaction is subject to approval by shareholders of each company, regulatory
approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
Each
of the business combinations will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price for each transaction will be allocated to the underlying assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the respective dates of acquisition. We will determine the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals, discounted
cash flows, quoted market prices and estimates made by management. To the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, such
excess will be allocated to goodwill.

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of December31, 2004, that our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act are effective for gathering, analyzing and disclosing the information we are required to
disclose in our reports filed under the Exchange Act. There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to
the date of the previously mentioned evaluation. 
There
have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the
Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, together with other members of management of Merge Technologies Incorporated, are responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. 
Internal
control over financial reporting is the process designed under our supervision, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable
assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 
There
are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility that misstatements may not be prevented or detected.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of internal
controls can change with circumstances. 
Management
has evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, in relation to criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations Commission of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
assessment, management concluded that, as of December31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. 
KPMG
LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued their report on management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which appears on
page35.
