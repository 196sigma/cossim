ITEM 8 HEREIN.
GENERAL
The Company, founded in 1932, manufactures capital equipment for the
theatre and restaurant industries. The Company theatre products segment
consists of commercial motion picture projection equipment and long-range follow
spotlights. The Company restaurant products segment consists of commercial
foodservice equipment, principally pressure fryers, barbecue/slow cooking ovens
and rotisserie ovens. This equipment is complemented by related items, such as
seasonings and marinades, paper serving products and point of purchase displays.                     -17   The Company was acquired by Canrad Inc. in 1976 as a means of vertically
integrating Canrad Inc. other product segments which included the manufacture
and sale of xenon short arc bulbs as the light source for motion picture
projection equipment and long-range follow spotlight industries.
RECENT ACQUISITIONS
On December 2, 1994, the Company acquired certain net assets, primarily
accounts receivable, inventories and the business of Westrex, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Litton Systems Inc. for a purchase price of approximately
$576,200. The purchase was paid for with $100,000 and a promissory note of the
Company in the amount of approximately $476,200. From its location in Hong
Kong, Westrex sells and services theatre equipment in Hong Kong and other
countries located in the Pacific Rim. The Company expects to sell its
spotlights and restaurant products in Hong Kong and the Far East through
Westrex.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
Net sales increased by $13,312,500 or 346% for the year ended December 31,
1996 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1995. The following table shows
comparative net sales of Theatre Products and Restaurant Products for the
respective periods                      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1996          1995
Theatre Products        $49,387,700      $35,440,400
Restaurant Products        2,366,200       3,001,000
$51,753,900      $38,441,400
Net sales of Theatre Products increased by $13,947,300 or 394% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the same period of the
prior year. Within the segment, net sales of commercial motion picture
projection equipment increased by approximately $13,763,400 or 411% and follow
spotlights increased approximately $183,900 or 93%. The gain was attributable
to increased sales of commercial motion picture projection systems, including
projectors, soundhead reproducers, consoles, platters, lenses and replacement
parts. The majority of the increase is attributable to net sales of commercial
motion picture products to foreign customers and to domestic customers for end
users expanding into foreign markets, an area where net export sales of Theatre
Products increased by $2,915,000 or 35% from 1995. Net sales of replacement
parts increased from approximately $4,879,000 in 1995 to approximately
$6,131,500 in 1996. 
Net sales of Restaurant Products decreased by approximately $634,800. This
decrease is due in part to a loss of two customer accounts, one major customer
in the domestic market and a saturation of one foreign customer.                     -18   Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 286% in 1995 to
297% in 1996. The increase is attributable to increased sales volume and
throughput in manufacturing.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately
$1,366,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to the same period
of 1995. However, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 136% from 148% of net sales. In terms of
the dollar increase, 1996 includes amounts paid under the Company profit
sharing plan which is reflective of the increased operating results and
additional expenses incurred for a full year operating as a public company. The
decrease as a percentage of sales resulted from the fact that the additional
Theatre Products sales were generated without a significant increase in selling
costs, including advertising, travel and the number of employees. Operating
expenses include a management fee in the amount of approximately $300,000 for
both periods.
Interest expense amounted to approximately $363,500 for 1996 as compared to
approximately $277,300 for 1995. Included in interest expense is interest
incurred from the Norwest Bank revolving credit facility.
The actual income tax expense amounted to approximately 37% as compared to
a statutory rate of 34%. The difference relates to the effects of state income
taxes and the non-deductibility of certain intangible expenses, principally
goodwill. 
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994
Net sales increased by $9,683,000 or 337% for the year ended December 31,
1995 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1994. The following table shows
comparative net sales of Theatre Products and Restaurant Products for the
respective periods:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,   
1995        1994
Theatre Products....... $35,440,400      $25,731,200
Restaurant Products......  3,001,000       3,027,200
$38,441,400      $28,758,400
Net Sales of Theatre Products increased by $9,709,200 or 377% for the
twelve months ended December 31, 1995 as compared to the same period of the
prior year. Within the segment, net sales of commercial motion pictures
projection equipment increased by approximately $10,194,200 or 438% and follow
spotlights decreased approximately $485,000 or 20%. The gain in commercial
motion projection equipment was attributable to increased sales of commercial
motion picture projection systems, including projectors, soundhead reproducers,
consoles, platters, lenses and replacement parts. The majority of the increase
is attributable to net sales of commercial motion picture products to foreign
customers and to domestic customers for end users expanding into foreign
markets, an area where net export sales of Theatre Products increased by
$2,239,400 or 36% from 1994. Net sales of replacement parts increased from
approximately $4,716,700 in 1994 to approximately $4,879,000 in 1995. Net Sales
of Theatre Products in 1995 includes a full year of net sales of Westrex which
was acquired on December 2, 1994.                     -19   Net sales of Restaurant Products remained relatively consistent between the
respective periods, which is in part due to the Company historical focus on
the growth of the Theatre Products segment.
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 30% in 1994 to
286% in 1995. The decrease is primarily due to a full year of sales of Westrex
which has a lower percentage of gross profit.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately
$1,239,000 for the period ended December 31, 1995 as compared to the same period
of 1994. However, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased to 148% from 154% of net sales. In terms of
the dollar increase, 1995 includes a full twelve months of operating expenses of
Westrex, and includes amounts paid under the Company profit sharing plan which
is reflective of the increased operating results. The decrease as a percentage
of sales resulted from the fact that the additional Theatre Product sales were
generated without a significant increase in selling costs, including
advertising, travel and the number of employees. Operating expenses include
corporate overhead in the amount of approximately $300,000 for 1995 and $241,200
for 1994.
Interest expense amounts to approximately $277,300 for 1995 as compared to
approximately $238,700 for 1994. Included in interest expense in 1994 is an
allocation of corporate interest relating to the Collar Agreement which expired
on October 2, 1994, in the amount of approximately $129,700. Non-allocated
interest expense increased to $277,300 for the year ended December 31, 1995 from
approximately $109,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994. This increase
resulted from the indebtedness incurred in connection with the revolving credit
agreement with Norwest Bank.
The actual income tax expense amounted to approximately 40% as compared to
a statutory rate of 34%. The difference relates to the effects of state income
taxes and the non-deductibility of certain intangible expenses, principally
goodwill.                     -20 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has entered into a revolving credit agreement with Norwest
Bank, Nebraska, N.A. Norwest Facility. The Norwest Facility initially
provides for a borrowing commitment of up to $10,000,000. The commitment will
reduce by $500,000 on the first and second anniversary dates of such facility
and $1,000,000 on the third and fourth anniversary dates thereof. The entire
amount outstanding under the Norwest Facility will mature on August 30, 2000. At
December 31, 1996, $9,500,000 was available for reborrowing under the Norwest
Facility.  Amounts repaid under the Norwest Facility will be available for
reborrowing. Borrowings outstanding under the Norwest Facility will bear
interest, payable monthly, at a rate equal to Norwest Bank National Money
Market Rate, as announced from time to time 825% at March 1, 1997. As of
March 1, 1997, there were no borrowings under this facility.
All of the Company assets have been used to secure the Norwest Facility. 
The Norwest Facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which
include, among other things, a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends and
requirements relating to current, debt service coverage and total debt to
tangible net worth ratios and tangible net worth. The IRBs, the letter of
credit securing the IRBs and the Underwriting Agreement with J. W. Charles/CSG
and the other underwriters of the Company Offering also contain certain
restrictive covenants which include, among other things, a prohibition on the
payment of cash dividends.
Long-term indebtedness, including the current portion, decreased during
1996 by approximately $7,601,000 to approximately $458,300 at      
December 31, 1996. Such long-term indebtedness at December 31, 1996, was 
comprised as follows   $361,200    outstanding pursuant to the 79% IRBs
$ 97,100    non-compete agreement payable to ORC with imputed interest
of 10% maturing in March 1997
The principal reason for the net decrease in outstanding borrowings during
1996 was the payoff of $7,090,000 from borrowings under the Norwest Facility and
capital lease payoffs of manufacturing equipment in the amount of $215,000
through the use of proceeds from the August 1, 1996 equity offering. Also a
payment of $91,800 pursuant to a non-compete agreement with Optical Radiation
Corporation and $195,000 of payments made pursuant to the 79% Industrial
Development Revenue Bond.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased in 1996 by approximately
$1,869,000.
The Company anticipates that internally generated funds and borrowings
under its new operating loan facility will be sufficient to meet its working
capital needs. The Company expects that it will have capital expenditures of
approximately $1,740,000 in 1997 which include manufacturing equipment and
expansion of its current facility.
The Company does not engage in any currency hedging activities in
connection with its foreign operations and sales.                     -21 OTHER   Accrued expenses at December 31, 1995 amounted to approximately $1,444,900. 
Such accrued expenses were approximately $1,655,900 at December 31, 1996. The
increase was primarily attributable to increased profit sharing of approximately
$365,400, resulting from the increase in operating results in 1996 over those
attained in 1995.
INFLATION
The Company believes that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in
recent years have not had a significant impact on its net sales or
profitability. Historically, the Company has been able to offset any
inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies.                     -22 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 1.  The Company
Ballantyne of Omaha Inc., a Delaware corporation Ballantyne or the
Company, and its wholly-owned, subsidiaries Strong International Inc.,
Westrex and Flavor Crisp of America Inc., design, develop, manufacture and
distribute commercial motion picture equipment, follow spotlights and restaurant
equipment. The Company products are distributed worldwide through a domestic
and international dealer network and are sold to major movie exhibition
companies, sports arenas, auditoriums, amusement parks, special venues,
restaurants, supermarkets and convenience food stores. A majority 504% of
the Company common stock is owned by Canrad of Delaware Inc. Canrad, which
is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ARC International Corporation. 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies upon which the accompanying consolidated
financial statements are based are summarized as follows a.  Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.
b.  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out or market and
include appropriate elements of material, labor and manufacturing overhead.
c.  Goodwill and Other Intangibles
The excess of cost over the fair value of assets of business acquired is stated
at cost less accumulated amortization and is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the expected periods to be benefited, 5 to 25 years. Accumulated
amortization as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 amounted to $632,983 and $584,875,
respectively. The Company assesses and would recognize any deficiency of the
recoverability of this intangible asset by determining whether the amortization
of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through
undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operations.                     -31 Other intangibles, including a noncompete agreement, are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives or stated contract terms which include periods ranging
from 4 to 17 years. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 1996 and 1995
amounted to $419,559 and $324,705, respectively d.  Depreciation
Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided over the estimated useful lives
of the respective assets using the straight-line method. Charges are made to
operations in amounts sufficient to write off the cost of such assets over their
estimated useful lives.
e.  Income Taxes   
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
f.  Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to the customer.
g.  Research and Development
Research and development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred.
Such costs charged to operations amounted to $484,527, $362,690, and $326,338

h.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 107 Disclosure about 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments, defines the fair value of a financial 
instrument as the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged into a 
current transaction between willing parties. Cash, trade receivables, 
intercompany payable to parent, debt and accounts payable reported in the 
consolidated balance sheet equal or approximate fair values.
I. Use of Estimates

different geographic regions. To minimize credit concentration risk, the
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial
condition.

usefulness in comparing an industry segment of the Company with a similar
industry segment of another enterprise.

The Company has also adopted the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The
Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides for the purchase of shares of Ballantyne
common stock by eligible employees at a per share purchase price equal to 85% of
the fair market value of a share of Ballantyne common stock at either the

warrant to purchase 323,400 shares of Ballantyne common stock. The warrant is
exercisable at a per share price of $394. All shares subject to the warrant

A substantial portion of the shares of Ballantyne common stock owned by Canrad
are pledged to secure Canrad obligation under a credit facility provided by

shall have occurred and are continuing under such credit facility, Merita Bank
Ltd. shall have the right to sell all or any portion of such pledged shares at
one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any manner permitted
by the New York Uniform Commercial Code. The sale of all or a substantial
portion of such pledged shares could result in a change of control of

13.  Net Income Per Share
Net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. The effects of the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options
and warrants have been included in the income per share calculation for the
period that the shares were assumed issued using the treasury stock method. Net
income per share also reflects the effect of the assumed interest expense less
related tax effects of the $8,000,000 borrowing pursuant to the Norwest Bank
revolving credit facility which is assumed to be outstanding as of the beginning
of the earliest period presented, with no repayment being made during 1995 and
1994.                      -41 Weighted average shares outstanding amounted to 8,094,417 for the year ended
December 31, 1996, 6,654,344 for the year ended December 31, 1995 and,
6,600,000 for the year ended December 31, 1994. 
The Company Board of Directors declared a 3-for-2 stock split of the Company
common stock on January 29, 1997. The stock split was in the form of a 50%
common stock dividend payable March 5, 1997 to shareholders of record on
February 10, 1997. As a result of the stock split, Ballantyne outstanding
shares of common stock increased to approximately 8,569,785 at December 31,
1996. Per share data have been restated to reflect this stock split as of the
earliest period presented. The Company Board of Directors declared a 10%
stock distribution on January 23, 1996, which was issued on March 8, 1996, to
shareholders of record on February 9, 1996. This stock distribution resulted in
the issuance of 600,000 shares of common stock. Per share data have been
restated to reflect these stock distributions as of the earliest period
presented. The stock distribution is not considered a distribution of earnings
except to the extent that the Company has retained earnings, but rather had the
effect of increasing the number of outstanding shares.
