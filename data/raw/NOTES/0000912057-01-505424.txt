Item 8. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company due to adverse
changes in financial market prices, including interest rate risk, and other
relevant market rate or price risks.
The Company is exposed to some market risk through interest rates, related
to its floor plan borrowing arrangements, variable rate debt and discount rates
related to finance sales. Floor plan borrowings are based on the prime rate of
interest and are used to meet working capital needs. As of December 31, 2000,
the Company had floor plan borrowings of approximately $146,272,000. Assuming an
increase in the prime rate of interest of 100 basis points, interest expense
could increase by $1,462,720. The interest rate variability on all other debt
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial statements.
The Company provides all customer financing opportunities to various finance
providers. The Company receives all finance charges, in excess of a negotiated
discount rate, from the finance providers within 30 days. The negotiated
discount rate is variable, thus subject to interest rate fluctuations. This
interest rate risk is mitigated by the Company ability to pass discount rate
increases to customers through higher financing rates.                    38
