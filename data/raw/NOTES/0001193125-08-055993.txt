REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Speedway Motorsports, Inc.:
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company at December31, 2007, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The
Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A of this Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audit. We did not audit the financial statements of Motorsports Authentics, LLC, an investment accounted for under the equity method, with assets of $75 million reflected in Equity Investments in Associated Entities
as of December31, 2007 and losses of $57 million reflected in Losses on Equity Investees for the year ended December31, 2007. The financial statements of Motorsports Authentics, LLC, were audited by other auditors whose report thereon
has been furnished to us, and our opinion on the financial statements expressed herein, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Motorsports Authentics, LLC, is based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit and the report of other auditors provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. As discussed in Note8 to the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in 2007. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Charlotte, NC March 13, 2008  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.

Comparable events were held in 2005 and 2006.  LVMS hosted a CCWS event in 2005 that was not held in 2006 or 2007. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Principles of Consolidation All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue and
Expense Recognition The Company classifies its revenues as admissions, event related revenue, NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other operating revenue. Admissions includes ticket sales for all Company events. Event
related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees, luxury suite rentals, souvenir sales, commissions from food and beverage sales, promotional and hospitality revenues, track rentals, driving school revenues,
broadcasting rights other than NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other event and speedway related revenues. NASCAR broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of NASCAR-sanctioned events held at
the Companys speedways. Other operating revenue includes TSI, MBM and certain SMI Properties merchandising revenues, oil and gas transactions reported individually as gross revenue or on a net profit or loss basis, oil and gas
exploration and production revenues, Legends Car and parts sales, The Speedway Club at LMS and The Texas Motor Speedway Club together the Speedway Clubs revenues, Oil-Chem revenues, and industrial park and office tower rentals.
Earnings or losses on equity investees include the Companys share of joint venture equity investee profits or losses. The Company classifies its
expenses to include direct expense of events, NASCAR purse and sanction fees, and other direct operating expense, among other categories. Direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales, non-NASCAR race purses and
sanctioning fees, property and event insurance, compensation of certain employees, advertising, sales and admission taxes, cost of driving school revenues, event settlement payments to non-NASCAR sanctioning bodies and outside event support
services. NASCAR purse and sanction fees includes pay-

ments to NASCAR for associated events held at the Companys speedways. Other direct operating expense includes the cost of TSI, MBM and certain SMI
Properties merchandising, gross bulk petroleum, non-capitalized oil and gas exploration and production activities, Legends Cars, Speedway Clubs, Oil-Chem, and industrial park and office tower rental revenues. Event Revenues and Deferred Race Event Income, Net The Company recognizes admissions, NASCAR broadcasting and event related revenues when an event is held. Event
souvenir merchandise sales and commissions from food and beverage sales are recognized at time of sale. Advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held. Deferred expenses
primarily include race purses and sanction fees remitted to NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies and sales and admission taxes and credit card processing fees on advance revenues. Deferred race event income relates to scheduled events to be held in
upcoming periods. If circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season: igenerally advance revenue is refundable and iiall deferred direct event expenses would be immediately recognized except for race purses and
sanction fees which would be refundable from NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies, and for sales and admission taxes which would be refundable from taxing authorities. Management believes this accounting policy results in appropriate matching of
revenues and expenses associated with the Companys racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between its financial statements. Advance revenues, and certain related direct expenses, if any, for track rentals, driving school
and similar activities are deferred and recognized when the activities take place. Management believes its revenue recognition policies follow the guidance issued in SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No104 Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. Non-Event Souvenir Merchandise and Other Revenues The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped, title transfers to
customers, right of return or cancellation provisions expire, sales prices are final and collection is probable. For products sold on consignment through electronic media programming or other promotional activities, revenues are recognized upon
product shipment by promoters to customers, or purchase by reseller customers, and expiration of any right of return or cancellation provisions. Product sold on consignment with right of return or cancellation provisions has not been significant.
Joint Venture Equity Investments The equity method is used to account for investments in joint ventures and other associated entities where the
Company has significant influence, 
generally representing equity ownership of at least 20% and not more than 50%. As discussed in Note 1, equity investments in associated entities consist primarily of
the Companys 50% owned joint venture Motorsports Authentics. MA has a November30 fiscal year end that the Company adopted for reporting its share of MAs operating results so that reporting periods coincide. The Company records its
50% share of MAs net income or loss based on their most recent annual audited financial statements. The Companys share of MAs operating results for each fiscal year December1 through November30 are included in
losses on equity investees for the Companys fiscal year ended December31. All significant intercompany profits or losses have been eliminated in applying the equity method of accounting. No dividends have been received since
formation. The Companys share of undistributed equity deficit from equity investee losses included in the Companys retained earnings was approximately $59,727,000 at December31, 2007 and $2,305,000 at December31, 2006. See
Fair Value of Financial Instruments below for additional information on a contingent guarantee obligation associated with MA. The fiscal 2007 operating
results of MA include sizable impairment charges for inventory, tooling, goodwill and other intangible assets. These charges were due primarily to several NASCAR driver, team and sponsor changes, including Dale Earnhardt, Jr., a material MA
licensor, renaming of the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series in 2008, NASCARs introduction of a new car design the Car of Tomorrow, car manufacturer changes, other excess merchandise inventory and tooling no longer used for a
secondary product line. The Companys 50% share of these MA charges approximated $129 million for reduction of inventory and tooling to estimated net recoverable value and $348 million for reduction of MAs business net assets to
estimated fair value. MA management recorded the goodwill and other intangible impairment charge based on Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and SFAS No144
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. MAs fiscal 2007 results also reflect a loss from the sale of certain discontinued operations and certain nonrecurring adjustments. The Company follows the impairment provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No18 The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock
whereby declines in investment value assessed as other than temporary would be recognized as a charge to earnings. As described above, the Companys carrying value for its MA equity investment was significantly reduced as of December31,
2007 for impairment charges reflected by MA. As of December31, 2007, the Company believes there were 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 63  
no indications of a decline below MAs carrying value that was other than temporary. MA continues to have a material amount of inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets. Future profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand, trends, and other market conditions and factors such as the success of
motorsports, the popularity of its licensed drivers and teams, particularly NASCARs Sprint Cup Series, the success of the Car of Tomorrow, competition for MA products, and the success of MA management in achieving sustained
profitability. The Company may increase its investment in MA, including additional equity contributions or loans. MAs ability to compete successfully and profitably depends on a number of factors both within and outside managements
control. The Companys current and future carrying value of this equity investment could become impaired for changes in profitability, operating cash flows, market and economic conditions, and other factors that could adversely impact recovery.
Should future MA inventory or long-lived assets become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge, the Company would be required to record its 50% share which could have a material adverse impact on the Companys future financial
condition or results of operations. Also, should the fair value of the Companys equity investment in MA decline below its carrying value, and such decline was other than temporary, the Company would be required to record an impairment charge
to reduce the carrying value to fair value, which could have a material adverse impact on its future financial condition or results of operations. The following
table presents summarized financial information for MA as of November30, 2007 and 2006, and for the three years ended November30, 2007 coinciding with MA fiscal years in thousands:  2007 2006 2005
Current assets 46,078 98,782 Other noncurrent assets 148,113 228,821 Current liabilities 27,669 47,648 Noncurrent liabilities 16,500 14,266 Net sales 210,101 226,687 9,108
Gross profit 42,353 72,567 3,420
Impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets 69,499 Loss from continuing operations 111,961 11,860 446
Net loss 112,474 7,878 273
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In 2007, MA sold certain foreign operations. Prior to disposition, the
Companys 50% share of MAs accumulated other compre- 
hensive income, consisting of foreign currency exchange translation gains for those operations, were included in other comprehensive income with a
corresponding increase to equity investments in associated entities. Those accumulated translation gains were eliminated in accounting for the disposition. Oil
and Gas Activities Note 15 The Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production activities, and the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products and associated commodity transactions. The Company has conducted these business
activities primarily in Russia, Central America, North America, South America, Kuwait, Africa, and the United Kingdom. Oasis Trading Group LLC Oasis, a United States company, provides the Company strategic, management and operational capabilities
in connection with these activities. The Company provides financing and access to financial markets for such activities. The Company and Oasis generally share equally the profits and losses on all transactions and activities. At times, the Company
enters into futures contracts associated with petroleum products, utilizes letters of credit for the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products, and guarantees obligations of certain third parties to facilitate the purchase of bulk petroleum
products in exchange for part of the anticipated profits that may be derived by those third parties on such transactions. The Company also had profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain foreign entities on the purchasing and selling of
specified bulk petroleum products, and the Companys share of profits and losses is negotiated on a transaction-by-transaction basis, but generally ranges from 30% to 50%. Purchases, sales, bulk petroleum, oil and gas activities, futures
contracts, and letters of credit hereafter are collectively associated with or referred to as oil and gas activities, oil and gas business, oil and gas transactions or bulk petroleum transactions.
Consolidated Foreign Investments. The Companys Credit Facility, as amended in 2006 see Note 6, permits investments by or in Oil-Chem and its direct or indirect
subsidiaries Oil-Chem for oil and gas activities up to specified amounts. In 2006, SMIL purchased interests in two foreign entities owning certain oil and gas mineral rights in Russia, for cash consideration aggregating $4,000,000 to purchase the
company OOO Visheraneft and $2,589,000 for a majority interest in OOO Vorga. As of December31, 2007 and 2006, amounts invested and capitalized in these entities aggregate $15,225,000 approximately $6,484,000 for Visheraneft and $8,741,000 for
Vorga and $9,575,000, respectively, consisting principally of capitalized costs for oil and gas mineral rights, road construction, and exploration and drilling predominately with unproven reserves and, to a lesser extent, proven reserves accounted
for under the full cost accounting method. 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 64  
See Note 10 for information on legal proceedings associated with SMILs interest in Visheraneft.These entities are consolidated and associated minority
interests aggregating $49,000 and $96,000 as of December31, and 2007 and 2006 are included in other liabilities and will be reported separately in the consolidated balance sheet if and when significant. Capitalized expenditures for oil and gas
exploration and production activities, including acquisition related costs, amounted to $5,650,000 in 2007 and $9,575,000 in 2006.  Revenue Recognition and Other Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates the underlying transactional terms and conditions, along with associated accounting guidance,
in determining whether revenues, costs, and operating profits or losses, including changes in the fair value of commodity hedges and shared profits and losses, from oil and gas transactions should be reported on a gross or net basis. Associated oil
and gas exploration and production activities are accounted for using the full-cost method of accounting.Direct and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties are
capitalized and included in property and equipment as capitalized oil and gas exploration and production costs see Note 4.Amortization of these costs is determined using the unit-of-production method based on estimated proven oil
and gas reserves.Costs associated with properties under development or unevaluated are initially excluded from full cost amortization bases until determined proven or not, at which time capitalized amounts become subject to the
full cost ceiling limitations. The Company performs a quarterly ceiling test to evaluate whether carrying values of our full cost pools exceed ceiling limitations.No writedown of these costs was considered necessary as of December31,
2007. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No46R FIN 46R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, the Company evaluates whether the assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, and
operations of a variable interest entity should be consolidated. The Company has evaluated certain parties involved with its oil and gas investment activities under FIN 46R. Under certain FIN 46R exemptions, the Company excluded from evaluation
certain parties due to the business exemption or access to financial data. However, the activities of these entities are described below. Gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from bulk petroleum transactions are included in other operating revenue and other direct operating expense, respectively. The Company reports the 
changes in fair value, and settlement gains or losses, of futures contracts in other operating revenue. The Company had a contract to supply petroleum products that
was considered an energy supply contract and was treated as a derivative under SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities that expired on or about September30, 2006. The Company was not involved
in any energy supply contracts as of December31, 2007 or 2006. Operating profits or losses associated with the expired trading contract have been reported on a net basis in other operating revenue in 2006. The accounting for oil and gas activities, including underlying commodities or hedge transactions, can be affected by many factors, including contract terms, title
transfer, settlement timing, underlying commodity or hedge terms and other transactional terms or conditions. Depending on transactional terms and conditions, future transactions and resulting gains or losses, if any, could be reported on either a
gross or net basis. Mark-to-market accounting may be used for certain commodities or hedges and bulk petroleum purchases or supply contracts if deemed to be derivatives under SFAS No133. Depending on settlement timing and other transactional
factors, associated accounts receivable, inventories, liabilities, and outstanding letters of credit could significantly increase during and between reporting periods.  Revenues and Other Period Information. There were no oil and gas transactions reported on a gross basis in 2007 or 2006. For oil and gas transactions reported on a
gross basis during 2005, revenues totaled $14,086,000. There were no energy supply contract related oil and gas transactions reported on a net basis in 2007. For oil and gas transactions reported on a net basis, associated billings totaled
$150,007,000 in 2006 and $74,697,000 in 2005, and associated profits, excluding recovery allowances, amounted to $2,983,000 in 2006 and $2,218,000 in 2005.There were no significant revenues from Russian oil and gas exploration and production
activities in 2007 or 2006, and associated operating costs were not significant.  Credit and Other Risks and Contingencies. Oil and gas transactions may involve concentrations of credit and other risks different from the Companys motorsports
operations. As of December31, 2007, the Company had credit risk concentration in receivables associated with bulk petroleum sales and purchase transactions. Approximately $2,886,000 of net accounts receivable are due from a relatively small
number of petroleum industry customers and merchants in Central America 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 65  
and Russia. Also, from time to time, bulk petroleum inventory products may be located in and managed by a relatively small number of vendors in Russia or Central
America. The Companys Credit Facility contains a separate sub-limit for letters of credit of up to $75,000,000 for use in oil and gas activities and other business transactions. As of December31, 2007, the Company had $690,000 in
outstanding standby letters of credit associated with oil and gas activities and no bulk petroleum product inventory. As of
December31, 2007, uncertainty exists as to the recovery of $12,000,000 drawn by a bank under a Company guarantee for obligations owed by certain third parties for petroleum product purchases utilizing their bank line of credit. The bank
claimed and took possession of funds for payment under the guarantee for non-payment by the third parties, notwithstanding the Companys belief that payment was not required nor rightfully drawn upon by the bank. The Company believes it has
lawful recourse against the third parties and the bank, and is seeking recovery of the funds. However, uncertainty exists as to ultimate recovery of the amount due, which is reflected in accounts receivable, and has been fully reserved as of
December31, 2007. A recovery allowance of $12,000,000 is reflected in other direct operating expense in 2007. This assessment is subjective and based on facts, circumstances and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation, all of which are
subject to significant change. At December31, 2007, uncertainty exists as to the full realization of receivables due from two foreign entities
and Oasis under certain profit and loss sharing arrangements. Uncertainty exists about collecting amounts from two foreign entities because of problems with respect to access to funds, creditworthiness and certain other factors outside of
managements control when conducting operations in foreign countries. Management is currently pursuing available recovery alternatives. Under its profit and loss sharing arrangement, the Company has recorded receivables from Oasis, a
significant portion of which pertains to that entitys reimbursable share of loss associated with the recoverability assessment of amounts due from these two foreign entities. Oasiss ability to repay the Company this or any future amount
is largely dependent on sufficient profitability of future oil and gas activities; therefore, uncertainty exists regarding recoverability. As of December31, 2007, the Company has recorded allowances for these possibly uncollectible amounts of
approximately $23,086,000 based on estimated ultimate realization after possible recovery, settlement and other costs and insurance.  As of December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has recorded allowances
for possible uncollectible amounts aggregating approximately $35,086,000 and $17,598,000. Recovery allowances of approximately $18,798,000 in 2007, $15,057,000 in 2006 and $2,541,000 in 2005 are reflected in other direct operating expense. This
assessment is subjective and based on facts, circumstances and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation, all of which are subject to significant change. Such changes, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could have a material adverse
impact on the outcome of managements realization assessment and the Companys future financial condition or results of operations. As further described
in Note 15, in March 2008, because of the ongoing challenges with oil and gas activities, the Company is contemplating discontinuing those operations during 2008, although no final decision has been made. Although discontinuation plans are
contemplated, many or most of the following and other risk factor discussions remain relevant to the Companys oil and gas business activities. Realization of receivables, inventories and investments, including property and equipment, and the
ability to invest and compete successfully and profitably, are subject to many factors outside managements control. Factors that can adversely impact realization include changes or deterioration in customer financial condition and
creditworthiness; current and future market demand; customary risks associated with oil and gas exploration and production and other business activities; regional and global market and economic conditions; elevated terrorism alerts, terrorist
attacks or military actions including geopolitical situations in and surrounding specific countries or regions; government actions that restrict transactions, access to or transfers of assets or funds; other factors outside of managements
control when conducting operations in Russia and other foreign countries; global petroleum product supply and demand; regional or worldwide natural disasters such as hurricanes that adversely impact supply channels, merchandising, distribution and
operating costs; and other factors. Default on payment by one or more customers, or should inventory not be realized or recovered, could have a material adverse impact on the Companys operating results. The Companys oil and gas
activities include exploration and production arrangements that may be unsuccessful for many reasons including weather, cost overruns, dry wells, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Proven or unproven reserves may be less than
originally expected or found not cost beneficial to extract. Successful drilling of a well does not ensure ultimate realization of sufficient profits or return on investments because of a variety of factors, including geological, market,
geopolitical and other unforeseen fac-
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 66  
tors. Additionally, unsuccessful wells can result in costs with no direct associated revenue streams. The carrying value of current and future investments could become
impaired from insufficient sustained profitability and operating cash flows resulting from the aforementioned and other factors. Such 
factors, if significantly negative or unfavorable, could result in an impairment charge that has a material adverse impact on the Companys future financial
condition or results of operations.  Revenue Composition Note 13
The Companys revenues for the three years ended December31, 2007 are comprised of the following in thousands:  2007 2006 2005
Admissions 179,765 175,208 177,352
NASCAR broadcasting 142,517 162,715 140,956
Sponsorships 63,165 59,202 53,362
Other event related 115,485 106,855 96,546
Motorsports event and non-event, and non-motorsports, related merchandise 52,770 54,122 67,438
Other 7,944 9,263 8,414
Total revenue 561,646 567,365 544,068
Other event related revenue consists principally of commissioned food, beverage and souvenir sales, luxury suite rentals, and promotional and hospitality revenues
during racing and non-racing events, track rentals, driving school revenues, broadcasting rights other than NASCAR broadcasting revenue, and other event and speedway related revenues. Motorsports event related merchandise revenue
consists principally of SMI Properties and SMI Trackside revenues from sales of owned souvenir merchandise during racing and non-racing events and in speedway gift shops. Non-event motorsports related merchandise revenue consists
principally of revenues from TSI, certain SMI Properties and MBM sales of racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and from Legends Car operations. Non-motorsports merchandise revenue consists principally of Oil-Chem product
sales and revenues from oil and gas transactions. Other Revenue consists principally of revenues from the Speedway Clubs, industrial park and office tower rentals, and 600 Racing as the sanctioning body for Legends Car Circuit races.
Naming Rights The Company presently has two ten-year naming rights agreements that renamed Sears Point Raceway as Infineon Raceway and Charlotte Motor
Speedway as Lowes Motor Speedway. Combined gross fees aggregating approximately $69,000,000 are receivable over the ten-year agreement terms that commenced in 2002 for IR and 1999 for LMS. Annual contracted fee revenues, and associated
expenses, are recognized as associated events are held each year in accordance with the respective agreement terms. Food and Beverage Management Agreement
The long-term Levy Group food and beverage management agreement see Note 1 provides for, among other items, specified annual fixed and periodic gross revenue based commission pay- 
ments to the Company over the contract period. The Companys commission based net revenues associated with activities provided by the Levy Group are reported in
event related revenue or other operating revenue depending on the venue at which provided. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006,
SFAS No157 Fair Value Instruments was issued which, among other things, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value instruments. SFAS No157 applies under
other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and does not require any new fair value measurements. SFAS No157, among other things, clarifies various market participation assumptions and fair value
measurement, expands disclosures about using fair values in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition, and applies for derivatives and other financial instruments measured at fair value under SFAS No133 Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities at initial recognition and in all subsequent periods. This statement also nullifies certain guidance in EITF No02-3 Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for
Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities. SFAS No157 applies to and may impact the Companys reporting of equity investments in associated entities, which includes Motorsports
Authentics, and impairment analysis for long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets. SFAS No157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 and interim periods within those
fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, adopting SFAS No157 may have on its financial statements or disclosures.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 67  
In February 2007, SFAS No159 The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No115 was issued which, among other things, permits entities to irrevocably choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates. SFAS No159 was issued to improve
financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Most of the provisions of SFAS No159 apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to FASB Statement No115 Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities, and unrealized gains and losses are to be reported on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings
at each subsequent reporting date. SFAS No159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact,
if any, adopting SFAS No159 may have on its financial statements or disclosures. The Company has elected not to measure eligible items at fair value and believes adoption of SFAS No159 in the first quarter 2008 will not have a
significant impact on its financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB 51 was issued which, among other things, changes the accounting and reporting for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries or minority interests. Minority interests will be recharacterized as
noncontrolling interests and reported as a component of equity separate from parent equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions. Consolidated net income
will be reported at amounts that include amounts attributable to both the parent and noncontrolling interests, and amounts attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interests will be disclosed on the face of the consolidated statement of income.
SFAS No160 establishes a single method of accounting for changes in parent ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation, and eliminates the requirement to apply purchase accounting to parent acquisition of
noncontrolling ownership interests in a subsidiary. A parent will be required to recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated, and deconsolidate a subsidiary as of the date the parent ceases to have a controlling
financial interest. Upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. Also, expanded disclosures will be required that clearly identify and
distinguish between the 
interests of parent owners and noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary. SFAS No160 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December15, 2008, except for presentation and disclosure requirements, which are to be applied retrospectively. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any, adopting SFAS
No160 may have on its financial statements or disclosures. In December 2007, SFAS No141 Revised 2007 Business Combinations was issued
which, among other things, replaces SFAS No141. SFAS No141R retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized under purchase
accounting. It changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies, requires capitalizing in-process research and development costs at fair value, and requires expensing acquisition-related costs as
incurred. SFAS No141R defines an acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in a business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that acquirers achieve control. Noncontrolling interests in
acquirees are required to be measured at fair value which could result in recognizing goodwill attributable to noncontrolling interests. Also, specific guidance is provided on the subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from
contingencies acquired or assumed in a business combination. SFAS No141R does not apply to joint venture formations, acquisitions of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business, or a combination between entities or
businesses under common control. SFAS No141R is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. The Company has not
assessed the impact, if any, adopting SFAS No141R may have on its financial statements or disclosures. Use of Estimates The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires extensive use of management estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at financial statement dates, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. Such significant estimates include irecoverability of property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible
assets, equity investments in associated entities, and investments associated with oil and gas activities, iidepreciable lives for property and equipment and amortization periods for intangible assets, iiiaccounting for income taxes,
ivrealization of receivables and inventories, vaccruals for uninsured business risks, litigation and other contingencies and vidisclosures of stock-based compensation.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 68  Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company classifies as cash equivalents all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash equivalents
principally consist of variable rate, overnight sweep accounts of commercial paper, repurchase agreements, municipal bond and United States Treasury securities. Short-term Investments principally consist of highly liquid marketable mutual fund securities and auction rate securities held in large, qualified financial institutional investment accounts. These investments are classified as
trading securities and carried at fair value, and realized and unrealized gains or losses are included in the Companys consolidated statement of income. The Company has marketable securities investments in the Columbia Strategic
Asset Mutual Fund of Bank of America which suspended redemptions in December 2007. The Company had initially invested approximately $10,200,000, of which approximately one-half has been returned through March13, 2008. As of December31,
2007, the investment was recorded at its fair market value of 987% of par. The bond market for auction rate securities has recently experienced significant difficulties caused by decreased demand, failed auctions, unusual interest rates and other
challenges. As of December31, 2007, the Company has approximately $3,000,000 invested in auction rate securities which approximates fair value. Management has the ability and intends to hold these securities until the bond market recovers.
Management believes that further declines, if any, in the market value of these short-term investments are not likely to result in a significant loss to the Company. Accounts and Notes Receivable are reported net of allowance for doubtful accounts summarized as follows in thousands:  2007 2006 2005 Balance, beginning of year 19,303 4,730 2,122 Bad debt expense 408 5 418 Changes related to oil and gas transactions see above 18,798 15,057 2,541 Actual write-offs, net of specific accounts recovered 1,669 489 351 Balance, end of year 36,840 19,303 4,730
Other Noncurrent Assets as of December31, 2007 and 2006 consist of in thousands:  2007 2006
Deferred financing costs, net 6,460 8,090
Land held for development 12,265 12,265
Marketable equity securities 97 194
Other 4,395 3,699
Total 23,217 24,248
Noncurrent assets are generally reported at cost except for marketable equity securities which are reported at fair value.
Management evaluates these assets for recovery when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred. As of December31, 2007, there have been no events or circumstances which might indicate possible recoverability
concerns or impairment. Deferred Financing Costs are amortized over the associated debt terms of five to ten years, and are reported net of accumulated
amortization of $6,678,000 and $5,018,000 at December31, 2007 and 2006. Land Held For Development represents property adjacent to a regional outlet
mall in the Charlotte metropolitan area which management plans to develop and market. Because management is presently unable to determine if sale is probable within one year, as proscribed by SFAS No144 Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-lived Assets, the property has not been classified as held for sale. Marketable Equity Securities are classified as available
for sale as they are not bought and held principally for the purpose of near-term sale, and are reported at fair value, with temporary unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of
stockholders equity. Valuation allowances are reflected as a charge to stockholders equity to increase or decrease the carrying amount of these long-term marketable equity securities to market value, and consist of after tax gross
cumulative unrealized losses of $23,000 at December31, 2007 and cumulative unrealized gains of $19,000 at December31, 2006. There were no significant sales of marketable equity securities in 2005 through 2007. Management intends to hold
these securities through at least fiscal 2008, and has assessed any declines in fair value as temporary as of December31, 2007. Property and Equipment
Note 4 are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 69  
are charged to expense when incurred. Construction in progress includes all direct costs and capitalized interest on fixed assets under construction. When events or
circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred, the Company evaluates long-lived assets, including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization, for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating
cash flows attributable to such assets using SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets. When improvement projects produce a higher economic yield and require demolition of a component of a speedway
facility, capitalization of demolition, construction and historical component costs are limited to the revised estimated value of the project. Also, assets are classified as held for sale when management determines that sale is probable within one
year. See Oil and Gas Activities above for information on capitalized oil and gas exploration and production costs, and associated amortization methods. In connection with the development and completed construction of TMS in 1997, the Company entered into arrangements with the FW Sports Authority, a non-profit corporate instrumentality of the City of Fort Worth, Texas, whereby the Company
conveyed the speedway facility, excluding its on-site condominiums and office and entertainment complex, to the FW Sports Authority. The Company, which has the right to reacquire the facility, operates the speedway facility under a 30-year
arrangement with the FW Sports Authority. Because of the Companys responsibilities, including associated risks, rewards and obligations, under these arrangements, the speedway facility and related liabilities are included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Note 5 represent the excess of business acquisition costs over the fair value of net
assets acquired, and are all associated with the Companys motorsports related activities and reporting unit. Intangible assets consist predominately of goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for race event sanctioning and renewal
agreements, and to a lesser extent, goodwill associated with event related motorsports merchandising and amortizable intangible assets associated with network and other media promotional contracts for non-event motorsports merchandising. Acquired
intangible assets are valued using the direct value method. Nonamortizable intangible assets for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation are expected
to continue indefinitely. The Company follows SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets which specifies, among other things,
nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives and expanded testing for possible impairment at least annually. Management considers each speedway and motorsports and non-motorsports
merchandising subsidiary an operating segment and separate reporting unit principally because that is the lowest level for which discrete financial information is available to the Companys segment managers and chief operating decision maker.
No reporting units are aggregated for purposes of evaluating intangible assets for possible impairment. The Company evaluates intangible assets for possible impairment based on expected future discounted operating cash flows and profitability
attributable to such assets, which is supported by quoted market prices or comparable transactions where available or applicable. See Note 13 for information on aggregation of reporting units for segment reporting. The Company evaluates goodwill and
other intangible assets for possible impairment annually as of April1, or when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred. Managements latest annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets as of
April1, 2007 indicated there had been no impairment, and there has since been no events or circumstances which might indicate possible impairment as of December31, 2007. Deferred Income, Net noncurrent as of December31, 2007 and 2006 consists of in thousands:  2007

TMS Preferred Seat License Fees, Net TMS offers Preferred Seat License PSL agreements whereby licensees are
entitled to purchase annual TMS season-ticket packages for sanctioned racing events under specified terms and conditions. Among other items, licensees are required to purchase all season-ticket packages when and as offered each year. License
agreements automatically terminate without refund should licensees not purchase any offered ticket and are transferable once each year subject to certain terms and conditions. Also, licensees are not entitled to refunds for postponement or
cancellation of events due to weather or certain other conditions. Net PSL fees are deferred when received and amortized into income over the estimated useful life of TMSs facility or recognized upon license agreement termination. 
Deferred Speedway Club Membership Income The LMS and TMS Speedway Clubs sell extended memberships that 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 70  
entitle members to certain dining, other club and racing event seating privileges, and require upfront fees and monthly assessments. Net membership revenues are
deferred when billed and amortized into income over an estimated average membership term of ten years. Advertising Expenses Event specific advertising
costs are expensed when an associated event is held and included principally in direct expense of events. Non-event related advertising costs, including direct-response advertising once primary media promotion has commenced, are expensed as incurred
and included principally in other direct operating expense. Advertising expense amounted to $13,753,000 in 2007, $13,204,000 in 2006 and $13,715,000 in 2005. There were no direct-response advertising costs deferred at December31, 2007 or 2006.
Operating Leases The Company has various operating leases principally for office and warehouse space and for equipment used in conducting racing
events and other operations. These operating leases typically have initial terms of less than one year or are cancelable with minimal notice. Rent expense for operating leases amounted to $5,326,000 in 2007, $4,710,000 in 2006 and $4,912,000 in
2005. Various office and warehouse facilities are leased from an affiliate see Note 9 that are cancelable with minimal notice; however, such lease arrangements will likely be renewed annually through specific contract periods. Assuming renewal
through contracted periods, future annual minimum lease payments are as follows: $1,064,000 in 2008, $901,000 in 2009, $670,000 in 2010, $536,000 in 2011, and $286,000 in 2012. Loss Contingencies and Financial Guarantees The Company accrues a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable. Legal and other costs associated with
loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company accounts for financial guarantees using FASB Interpretation No45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of FASB Statements No5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No34 FIN 45. FIN 45 requires, among other things, that guarantors recognize a liability for the fair
value of obligations undertaken by issuing a guarantee. 2005 AMS Insurance Recovery Gain In July 2005, a tornado struck AMS causing significant damage
to its facilities. The Company assessed damages and established restoration plans and costs using outside insurance administrators and consultants, internal construction and development personnel, and other consultants. The Companys
settlement of insurance claims was substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2005. The Company accounted for the effects of the tornado damage using FASB
Interpretation No30 Accounting for Involuntary Conversion of Nonmonetary Assets to Monetary Assets and other applicable authoritative guidance. The Company ceased depreciating damaged property and equipment in July 2005 and began
depreciating new and restored assets when placed in service. Restoration progressed sufficiently to allow AMS to conduct its NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and other races as scheduled in October 2005. AMS insurance recovery gain in 2005 represents
insurance recoveries upon final resolution of insurance claims of $29,400,000 net of a loss on damaged property and equipment of $20,571,000. Other Expense

2006 and 2005. At December31, 2004, notes receivable included $3,500,000 associated with the sale of certain land which management was developing and
marketing. Sales terms consisted of $100,000 cash and a $3,900,000 8% promissory note receivable initially scheduled payable in varying installments through 2009. The associated gain was deferred and being recognized into income using the
installment method. The note receivable was collected in full in the first quarter 2005 resulting in gain recognition of $903,000. Income Taxes Note 8
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income taxes are provided 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 71  
using the liability method whereby estimated deferred income taxes, and significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, reflect managements
assessment of future taxes likely to be paid, including timing, probability of realization and other relevant factors. The Companys accounting for income taxes reflects managements assessment of future tax liabilities based on
assumptions and estimates for timing, likelihood of realization, and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation. Share-Based Compensation Note 11 
The Company implemented SFAS No123R Share-Based Payment as of January1, 2006 which generally requires recognizing compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation over the
requisite service period, and applies to all awards granted, modified, vesting, repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date of January1, 2006. The Company elected the modified prospective method of transitioning to SFAS
No123R, and as of January1, 2006 began recognizing compensation expense related to stock option and other share-based compensation grants, including immediate recognition for grantees who are retirement-eligible rather than ratably over
the vesting period regardless of retirement-eligibility. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value estimates are based on relevant market
information and quoted market prices where available at a specific point in time, and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
accounts and notes receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments. Short-term investments, marketable debt and equity securities, and interest rate swaps are carried at fair value
based on quoted market prices. Notes and other receivables and bank revolving credit facility borrowings are frequently repriced variable interest rate financial instruments, and therefore, carrying values approximate fair value. Fair value
information for the interest rate swap agreement is described in Note 6 Interest Rate Swaps. Quoted market prices are not available for determining market value of the Companys equity investments in associated entities or
consolidated foreign oil and gas investments. For equity investments, the Company estimates fair value using various methods including estimated discounted cash flows and comparable revenue and other market multiples. For oil and gas investments,
fair value is assessed in conjunction with the Companys full cost ceiling limitation tests. There were no commodities or hedges associated with oil and gas transactions as of December31, 2007 or 2006. As of December31, 2007, the Company had contingent guarantee obligations associated with an equity investment 
that are limited to $12,500,000, decrease annually and expire through 2015 based on specified terms and conditions. At this time, management believes the fair value of
this guarantee is presently insignificant. Fixed rate 63/4% senior subordinated notes have carrying and fair values as of

Note 6 330,000 330,000 323,400 330,000 Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts and notes receivable, marketable equity securities and interest rate swaps. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and
interest rate swaps with major high-credit qualified financial institutions, limiting its exposure to concentrations of credit risk. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable, excluding those associated with oil and gas
transactions, are limited due to the large numbers and wide variety of customers and customer industries and their broad geographical dispersion. The Company generally requires sufficient collateral equal to or exceeding note amounts, or accepts
notes from high-credit quality companies or high net-worth individuals, limiting its exposure to credit risk. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to marketable equity securities are limited through portfolio diversification. As further
described above in Oil and Gas Activities, those activities have concentrations of credit risk different from the Companys motorsports operations as of December31, 2007. Other Contingencies LMSs property includes areas used as solid waste landfills for many years. Landfilling of general categories of municipal solid waste on
the LMS property ceased in 1992, but LMS currently allows certain property to be used for land clearing and inert debris landfilling LCID. Landfilling for construction and demolition debris CD has ceased on the LMS property. Management
believes the Companys operations, including the landfills on its property, comply with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Management is not aware of any situation related to landfill operations which
would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, future results of operations or cash flows. Restatement of Financial Statement
Presentation The Company restated the classification of a portion of noncurrent 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 72  
deferred income tax liabilities to current deferred income tax liabilities in the accompanying December31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet. The restatement
reflects the scheduled reversal of certain temporary timing differences related to a tax depreciation method accounting change see Note 8 based on SFAS No37 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Income Taxes. Amounts as
reported in the Companys 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K were current deferred income tax assets of $6,115,000 and noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of $166,165,000. The restatement decreased current deferred income tax assets
$6,115,000, decreased noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities $28,179,000, and increased current deferred income tax liabilities $22,064,000 at December31, 2006. The restatement had no impact on the Companys results of operations,
cash flows or stockholders equity as of and for the year ended December31, 2006. Income tax disclosures in Note 8 and elsewhere as applicable have been restated to conform to the 2007 presentation. 3. INVENTORIES Inventory costs consist of: isouvenirs and small-scale finished vehicles determined on a first-in, first-out basis;
and iiapparel, micro-lubricant, and parts and accessories product costs determined on an average current cost basis. No general and administrative costs are included in inventory costs. Cost

Increases in the gross carrying value of goodwill in 2006 reflect the Companys final purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of certain Jim Russell Group, Inc.
operations principally driving school and karting activities and replacement car parts sales that resulted in increasing goodwill and accrued expenses by $381,000. Decreases in the gross carrying value of goodwill in 2006 reflect the sale of JRG
operations in December 2006. Amortization expense on other intangible assets amounted to $129,000 in each year for 2005 through 2007. Estimated annual amortization expense for each of the next five years ranges from $119,000 to $129,000, excluding
the impact, if any, from the acquisition of New Hampshire Motor Speedway subsequent to December31, 2007 see Note 14.  6. LONG-TERM DEBT

Bank Credit Facility Note 14 The Company has a long-term, senior revolving credit facility the Credit
Facility or the Revolving Facility obtained from a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. as an agent and lender. As of December31, 2007, and before amendment in January 2008, the Revolving Facility: iprovides for aggregate
borrowings of up to $400,000,000, including separate sub-limits of $10,000,000 for borrowings under 15-day swing line loans and $75,000,000 for letters of credit; iimatures March 2010; iiiallows annual aggregate payments of dividends
and repurchases of SMI securities of up to $75,000,000, increasing up to $150,000,000 subject to maintaining certain financial covenants; ivlimits annual capital expenditures to $80,000,000; vallows the Company to consummate
motorsports industry related transactions provided that aggregate cash consideration in any fiscal year does not exceed 35% of its consolidated net worth at the immediately preceding fiscal year end; and viallows the Company to consummate
other acquisitions consistent with its business provided that cash consideration paid for such other acquisitions does not exceed an aggregate of $100,000,000 over the Credit Facility term. The Credit Facility, as amended in 2006, permits
investments aggregating up to an additional $50,000,000 in the Companys oil and gas activities and certain other businesses, and allows for additional investments, contracts and contract assignment associated with the Companys buying and
selling of bulk petroleum products to specified foreign parties see Note 2 Oil and Gas Activities for additional discussion on these activities. Loans under the Revolving Facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed, from
time to time, subject to certain conditions on the date borrowed. Interest is based, at the Companys option, upon LIBOR plus 0875% to 175% or the greater of Bank of Americas prime rate or the Federal Funds rate plus 05%. The margin
applicable to LIBOR borrowings is adjustable periodically based upon certain ratios of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA. At both December31, 2007 and 2006, outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility were $98,438,000. As of December31, 2007, outstanding letters of credit amounted 
to $1,862,000, and the Company could borrow up to an additional $299,700,000 under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility contains a number of affirmative and negative financial covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain certain ratios of funded debt to EBITDA, funded senior debt to EBITDA and earnings before
interest and taxes EBIT to interest expense, and to maintain a minimum net worth. Negative covenants restrict, among other things, the incurrence and existence of liens, specified types of investments, restricted payments, dividends, equity and
debt security repurchases, capital expenditures, transactions with affiliates, acquisitions, sales of assets, and incurring other debt. Indebtedness under the Credit Facility is guaranteed by all operative Company subsidiaries except Oil-Chem and
its subsidiaries the Guarantors, and is secured by a pledge of all capital stock and limited liability company interests of the Guarantors. Senior Subordinated Notes In May 2003, the Company completed a private placement of 63/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2013 for principal of $230,000,000, filed a registration statement in August 2003 to exchange these notes for
substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act, and completed the exchange offer in September 2003. In July 2004, the Company completed a $100,000,000 private placement add-on offering to the $230,000,000 Senior Subordinated Notes
issued in May 2003 to fund the purchase of North Carolina Speedway. The add-on notes were issued at par and net proceeds, after commissions and fees, approximated $98,250,000. The Company filed a registration statement in August 2004 to exchange
these add-on notes for substantially identical registered notes and completed the exchange offer in October 2005. The add-on notes are identical to the Senior Subordinated Notes issued in May 2003 with the same interest rate, maturity, covenants,
limitations, and other terms and are governed by the same indenture hereafter both issuances are referred to as the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Senior
Subordinated Notes mature in 2013, are guaranteed by all operative Company subsidiaries except Oil-Chem and its subsidiaries, and interest payments are due semi-annually on June1 and December1. The Indenture governing the Senior
Subordinated Notes permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately $040 per share of common stock, increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants. The Senior Subordinated Notes are subordinated to all present and future senior
secured indebtedness of the Company, including the Credit Facility described above. The Company may redeem some or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes at annually declining redemption premiums ranging from 103375% of par in fiscal years beginning
June1, 2008 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 75  
to par after June1, 2011. In the event of a change of control, the Company must offer to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes at 101% of par value plus
accrued and unpaid interest. The Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes contain certain other requirements and restrictive financial covenants and
limitations on capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, repurchase or issuance of SMI securities, and other limitations or prohibitions on incurring other indebtedness, pledges of assets to any third party, transactions with affiliates,
guarantees, asset sales, investments, distributions and redemptions. The Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture agreements contain cross-default provisions. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the
Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes as of December31, 2007. Interest Rate Swaps The Company at times uses interest rate swaps for
non-trading purposes to hedge interest rate risk and optimize a combination of variable and fixed interest rate debt. In 2003, the Company entered into two interest rate swap transactions with a financial institution that provided fixed interest
rate features on certain variable rate term loan obligations and variable interest rate features on certain fixed rate senior subordinated debt obligations. The Company presently has one interest rate cash flow swap relating to certain variable rate
debt obligations. Changes in fair value and differentials paid or received in periodic settlements are reflected as an adjustment to interest expense and included in operating activities in the statement of cash flows. As discussed below, in 2005,
the Company terminated a fair value hedge interest rate swap that provided variable interest rate features on certain fixed rate term loan obligations. For early terminated swap agreements, net settlement payments at termination are deferred when
received and amortized into income as a yield adjustment to interest expense over the underlying hedged debt term. Under the present interest rate swap agreement,
the Company pays a 387% fixed interest rate and receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on a principal notional amount of $34,375,000. The agreement provides for quarterly settlement and expires corresponding with the underlying hedged
debt term. In 2006, the cash flow swap agreement was determined not to meet the conditions for hedge accounting under SFAS No133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and was reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income as a reduction in interest expense of $1,722,000, before income taxes of $670,000. Interest expense was not impacted prior to discontinuation of 
hedge accounting. Interest expense increased $998,000 in 2007 and $724,000 in 2006 due to market value changes of the interest rate swap agreement. At
December31, 2007 and 2006, the Company has reflected a derivative asset for this swap of less than $1,000 and $998,000. In 2005, the fair value hedge swap agreement was terminated and settled with a $501,000 net payment to the Company. The
$501,000 net gain was deferred when received and is being amortized into income as an adjustment to interest expense over the underlying hedged debt term through May 2013. Such interest expense adjustments totaled $63,000 in 2007, $63,000 in 2006
and $31,000 in 2005. Interest expense reflects net settlement receipts totaling $617,000 in 2007, $599,000 in 2006 and $545,000 in 2005. Subsidiary
Guarantees Amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated Notes are guaranteed by all SMI operative subsidiaries except for Oil-Chem and its subsidiaries. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and
several. The parent company has no independent assets or operations. There are no restrictions on the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or advance funds to SMI. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, interest income and capitalized interest costs are summarized as follows in thousands:  2007 2006 2005 Gross interest costs 30,687 28,660 28,183 Less: capitalized interest costs 2,282 2,202 862 Interest expense 28,405 26,458 27,321 Interest income 7,421 5,673 5,431 Interest expense, net 20,984 20,785 21,890 Weighted-average interest rate on borrowings under bank Credit Facility 62 62 47 7.

Annual Report on Form 10-K 77  Tax effects of temporary differences resulting in deferred income taxes are as follows in thousands:  2007 2006 Deferred tax liabilities Property and equipment 154,554 167,357 Expenses deducted for tax purposes and other 12,782 11,016 Subtotal 167,336 178,373 Deferred tax assets Income previously recognized for tax purposes 21,025 13,007 Stock option compensation expense 1,376 846 PSL and other deferred income recognized for tax purposes 3,776 4,077 State and federal net operating loss carryforwards 2,253 2,001 Equity investment 21,286 Foreign tax credits 182 Subtotal 49,716 20,113 Less: Valuation allowance 22,800 1,790 Net deferred tax assets 26,916 18,323 Total net deferred tax liabilities 140,420 160,050 Net current deferred tax liabilities 22,229 22,064 Net non-current deferred tax liabilities 118,191 137,986
At December31, 2007, the Company has approximately $48,900,000 of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire
in 2008 through 2027. At December31, 2007 and 2006, valuation allowances of $22,800,000 and $1,790,000 have been provided against deferred tax assets because management is unable to determine whether ultimate realization is more likely than
not for certain deferred tax assets and state net operating loss carryforwards. Effective Tax Rate for 2007 Compared to 2006 The effective income tax
rate change for 2007 as compared to 2006 is due primarily to the Company reflecting a valuation allowance of approximately $20,547,000 against deferred tax assets, associated with 2007 equity investee losses of Motorsports Authentics see Note 2,
because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not. The Companys 2007 effective income tax rate of 604% reflects an increase of approximately 221% resulting from the valuation allowance. The 2007 tax
rate increase also reflects an increase of $464,000 in valuation allowances on certain state net operating loss carryforwards because management is unable to determine that ultimate realization is more likely than not.  Effective Tax Rate for 2006 Compared to 2005 The effective income tax rate change for 2006 as compared to 2005 is due primarily to decreased effective state income tax rates resulting from the State of Texas replacing its
franchise tax with a defined margin tax which is accounted for as an income tax under SFAS No109 Accounting for Income Taxes from the May 2006 enactment period, and to the benefit of foreign tax credits and a favorable examination
settlement with the Internal Revenue Service as discussed below. The defined margin tax change reduced the Companys 2006 income tax expense by $2,600,000 and effective income tax rate by 15%. Tax Depreciation Method Change At December30, 2007 and 2006, the Company had significant net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities, the majority of which pertain
to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment for tax reporting purposes. In evaluating the potential effects of a tax advice memorandum published by the Internal Revenue Service IRS, the Company filed in 2005 a change in tax
accounting method with the IRS with respect to, among other things, changing tax depreciation methods and extending depreciable lives for certain significant motorsports facility assets. The tax method accounting change is expected to reduce the
Companys tax depreciation expense for certain previous years and is being included in federal and state taxable income over four years beginning in 2005. The Company paid accelerated taxes of $28,179,000 in 2007, $27,266,000 in 2006 and
$19,912,000 in 2005. Management believes the Companys use of a seven-year recovery period prior to 2004 was appropriate in view of then existing tax law and related guidance. Management believes filing the change in tax accounting method was
the best course of action to minimize costs and uncertainty. Management believes the Company has sufficiently provided for income taxes and associated reserves, and no current or future charge to earnings is expected at this time resulting from the
tax accounting change. These amounts should be substantially recovered in succeeding years from increased tax depreciation as these assets continue to be depreciated for tax purposes over longer periods. As such, management does not believe the tax
accounting change will have a material adverse effect on the Companys future financial position or results ofoperations. IRS Examination 
In 2006, the IRS began performing a periodic examination of the Companys federal income tax returns for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003. In February 2007, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS regarding all assessments
proposed with respect to those tax returns. Adoption of FASB Interpretation No48 As of January1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 78  
Statement No109 FIN 48 which, among other things, prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosures and transition. Evaluation of a tax position includes determining whether it is
more likely than not a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed the position will be examined by appropriate taxing authorities having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is
measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The
requirement to assess the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the sufficiency of future taxable income is unchanged by this Interpretation. FIN 48 applies to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. 
In adopting FIN 48, the Company recognized an increase to income tax liabilities of $7,633,000 and noncurrent deferred tax assets of $3,220,000, and a corresponding cumulative
adjustment decrease to retained earnings of $4,413,000 as of January1, 2007. The non-cash adjustment had no impact on the Companys results of operations. As of December31, 2007, income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits
of approximately $7,159,000 were included in other noncurrent liabilities, all of which would affect the Companys effective tax rate if recognized. As of December31, 2006, income tax liabilities of approximately $2,976,000 were
classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities based on SFAS No5 Accounting for Contingencies. As of December31, 2007, management was not aware of any significant tax positions where it appeared reasonably possible
that unrecognized tax benefits might significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. The Company reports interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities, when applicable, in income tax expense. In 2007, the Company
recognized $538,000 in interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. As of December31, 2007, the Company had $3,373,000 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, which is included in other noncurrent
liabilities. It is reasonably possible the Company could recognize approximately $407,000 of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months upon the expiration of a statute of limitations. The tax years that remain open to examination
include 2002 through 2007 by the North Carolina Department of Revenue, and 2004 through 2007 by all other taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.  A reconciliation of the change in the
total unrecognized tax benefits and other information for the year ended December31, 2007 is as follows in thousands:  2007 Beginning of period 7,774 Increases for tax positions of current year 230 Decreases for tax positions of prior years 699 Reductions for lapse of applicable statute of limitations 146 Reductions for settlements with taxing authorities End of period 7,159
Taxes Collected from Customers The Company reports sales, admission and other taxes collected from customers
on both a gross and net basis in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Such taxes reported on a gross basis amounted to $12,327,000 in 2007, $12,049,000 in 2006 and $11,471,000 in 2005. 9. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Before
July30, 2002, the Company made loans to, and paid certain expenses on behalf of, Sonic Financial Corporation Sonic Financial, a Company affiliate through common ownership by the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, for
various corporate purposes. Also, the Company and Sonic Financial currently share various expenses in the ordinary course of business. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at December31, 2007 and 2006 include $5,331,000 and $5,492,000
due from Sonic Financial. The amount due bears interest at 1% over prime, is payable on demand, and because the Company did not anticipate or require repayment before December31, 2008, is classified as a noncurrent asset in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the amount due from December31, 2006 primarily reflect increases for accrued interest on outstanding balances and decreases from repayments by, and shared expenses with, affiliates. Any increases pertain
to note receivable arrangements in place before July30, 2002. The amounts due were reduced from shared expenses and repayments net of accrued interest by $161,000 in 2007, $86,000 in 2006 and $284,000 in 2005. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at December31, 2006 included $1,087,000 due from a partnership in which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
is a partner, and $951,000 due from the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The amounts due were repaid in full during 2007. The partnership note was collateralized by certain partnership land. The other amount due represented
premiums paid by the Company under a split-dollar life 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 79  
insurance trust arrangement on behalf of the Chairman, cash advances and expenses paid by the Company on behalf of the Chairman before July30, 2002 and accrued
interest. Notes and other receivables from affiliates at December31, 2007 and 2006 also include $3,459,000 and $3,196,000, including accrued interest, due
from Motorsports Authentics, a 50% owned joint venture see Note 1. The note was executed in 2006, bears interest at prime and is due within thirteen months of demand. Because the Company does not anticipate or require repayment before
December31, 2008, the amount has been classified as a noncurrent asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Amounts payable to affiliate at
December31, 2007 and 2006 consist of $2,594,000 for acquisition and other expenses paid on behalf of AMS by Sonic Financial prior to 1996. Of this amount, approximately $1,800,000 bears interest at 383% and the remainder at prime plus 1%. The
entire amount is classified as long-term based on expected repayment dates. 600 Racing and SMI Properties each lease an office and warehouse facility from Chartown,
a Company affiliate through common ownership by the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, under annually renewable lease agreements. Rent expense for 600 Racing approximated $233,000 in 2007, $197,000 in 2006 and $197,000 in 2005, and
for SMI Properties approximated $264,000 in 2007, $333,000 in 2006 and $333,000 in 2005. At December31, 2007 and 2006, amounts owed to Chartown were not significant. LVMS purchased new and used vehicles for employee use from certain subsidiary dealerships of Sonic Automotive, Inc. SAI, an entity in which the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is a controlling stockholder, for
approximately $345,000 in 2007, $321,000 in 2006 and $236,000 in 2005. LVMS sold used vehicles to SAI for approximately $163,000 in 2007, $139,000 in 2006 and $105,000 in 2005. At December31, 2007 and 2006, there were no associated amounts due
to or from SAI. Oil-Chem sold zMax micro-lubricant product
to certain SAI dealerships for resale to service customers of the dealerships in the ordinary course of business. Total purchases from Oil-Chem by SAI dealerships approximated $1,917,000 in 2007, $1,392,000 in 2006 and $1,495,000 in 2005. Oil-Chem
leases a warehouse facility from Chartown under an annually renewable lease agreement. Annual rent expense for Oil-Chem was not significant in 2005 through 2007. At December31, 2007 and 2006, approximately $175,000 and $143,000 was due from
SAI and is reflected in current assets. SMI Properties purchased and sold motorsports merchandise, and received commissions for merchandise sold during
Company events from Motorsports Authentics, a 50% owned joint venture see Note 1. In 2007 and 2006, merchandise purchases approximated $12,787,000 and $10,364,000,
and merchandise sales and event related commissions approximated $3,805,000 and $4,770,000. During the period after MA formation and through December31, 2005, merchandise purchases approximated $440,000 and merchandise sales and event related
commissions approximated $220,000. At December31, 2007 and 2006, net amounts owed to MA approximated $4,004,000 and $791,000, and are reflected in current liabilities. In connection with supervising and managing significant construction and renovation projects at various SMI speedways, the Company incurred charges of approximately $161,000 from SAI in 2005 for project management services provided by SAI
employees with expertise in these areas. There were no significant project management services provided in 2007 or 2006. At December31, 2007 and 2006, $161,000 was owed to SAI and is included in current liabilities.

10. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENICES The Company is involved in various lawsuits in the normal course of business, some of which involve material claims. Management does not currently believe the outcome of these
lawsuits or incidents will have a material adverse effect on the Companys future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 80  Karen Davies and William Davies, individually and as guardians of Ryan Davies and Peyton Davies filed a lawsuit seeking damages against TMS, INEX, 600 Racing and SMI in the
District Court of Tarrant County, Texas on January2, 2007. Ryan Davies was injured while participating in an event at TMS, and the Davies allege that negligence on the part of TMS, INEX, 600 Racing and SMI caused the accident. TMS, INEX, and
600 Racing filed answers on February2, 2007 denying all material allegations. SMI made a special appearance on February2, 2007 challenging the jurisdiction of the Texas court over it. TMS, INEX, 600 Racing and SMI are vigorously
defending this matter. On March5, 2007, TMS, INEX, and 600 Racing filed counterclaims and third-party claims asserting that other parties were liable for the accident involving Ryan Davies. Discovery is ongoing in this matter. SMI is currently
unable to predict the amount of claims relating to this accident which may be made against it and how those claims might be resolved. At this time, management does not expect disposition of this case will have a material adverse effect on the
Companys future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company entered into an agreement with IDIA Network, LLC IDIA on or
about March29, 2006, pursuant to which IDIA would provide certain advertising at the Companys subsidiary motorsports venues through permanently installed video monitors. By letter dated April27, 2007, the Company issued a notice to
IDIA that it was in default under the agreement. On May10, 2007, IDIA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington the Bankruptcy
Court. On May24, 2007, IDIA filed an Adversary Proceeding against the Company in the Bankruptcy Court alleging fraud in the inducement and breach of contract. IDIA seeks a determination regarding the ownership of certain equipment, and
seeks damages of at least $5,000,000. The Company filed a motion seeking in the alternative a dismissal of the Adversary Proceeding or a transfer to the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The Bankruptcy Court
ruled on the Companys motions on August24, 2007. The Bankruptcy Court dismissed without prejudice IDIAs fraudulent inducement claim. IDIA previously amended its complaint to drop its breach of contract claim and to add a fraudulent
conveyance claim regarding monies paid by IDIA to the Company. The Bankruptcy court maintained jurisdiction over the claim seeking a determination over the ownership of certain equipment and the fraudulent conveyance claim. Trial in this matter is
scheduled for the week of April20, 2008. The Company is vigorously defending this matter, and does not expect disposition of this case will have a material adverse effect on the Companys future financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.  In 2006, the Company purchased a Russian entity, OOO Visheraneft, to exploit certain mineral rights in an existing oilfield in the Perm region of Russia the Perm Oilfield. The
Company has been informed that Visheranefts alleged predecessor entity and several of its shareholders have filed suit in the Russian courts challenging certain rights of Visheraneft. The alleged predecessor entity and the shareholders contend
they maintain an interest in the mineral rights license registered to Visheraneft with respect to the Perm Oilfield. On October17, 2007, the Trial Court ruled in Visheranefts favor with respect to challenges by its predecessor entity and
several of its shareholders against Visheranefts rights in its license. On December19, 2007, the intermediate appellate court upheld Visheranefts subsoil license rights. We are awaiting notice that no further appeals have been
taken. Additionally, the Company was informed on January23, 2008 that it was discovered in the process of attempting to make required filings with the local tax office to finalize the Companys acquisition of Visheraneft, that an unknown
third party had made what appeared to be a fraudulent filing purporting to show that party as the owner of Visheraneft. The Company believes this filing will be set aside as fraudulent and that the Companys acquisition will be finalized.
However, the Company is currently uncertain as to whether the issues involving Visheraneft will result in a material adverse impact on the Companys future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 11. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS AND ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R SHARE-BASED PAYMENT 2004 Stock Incentive Plan The 2004 Stock Incentive Plan the 2004 Plan was approved by stockholders at the 2004 Annual Meeting and provides equity-based incentives
for attracting and retaining key employees, directors and other individuals providing services to the Company. Awards under the 2004 Plan may consist of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options or restricted stock. The 2004 Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who has full authority to determine recipients, types and amounts of awards granted and amend the terms, restrictions and conditions of awards. For awards granted to non-employee
directors, the Board of Directors shall have the authority otherwise provided to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also may amend the terms of outstanding awards. However, no amendment, suspension or termination of the 2004 Plan
or amendment of outstanding awards may materially adversely affect previously granted awards without consent of the award recipient. Under the 2004 Plan, 2,500,000
shares of SMIs common stock are reserved for issuance, subject to various restrictions and adjustments including the following: ino more than 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 81  
1,000,000 shares may be granted in the form of restricted stock awards; iiif shares subject to award under the 2004 Plan are forfeited, or the award otherwise
terminates or is canceled for any reason without the issuance of such shares, those shares will be available for future awards; iiino individual may be granted options aggregating more than 100,000 shares of common stock during any calendar
year; and ivin the case of restricted stock awards that are designated as performance awards, no individual may be granted an aggregate of more than 35,000 shares of common stock during any calendar year. At December31, 2007,
approximately 1,915,000 shares are available for future grant. Exercise prices for awarded stock options generally may not be less than the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at, and exercise periods may not exceed ten years
from, the option grant date. The 2004 Plan is scheduled to terminate ten years from adoption in February 2004. Fair value under the 2004 Plan is generally the
NYSEs closing price for the Companys common stock on grant date. The option exercise price may be paid in cash, or if permitted by the Compensation Committee, in shares of Company common stock owned by the option holder. For incentive
stock options granted to holders of more than 10% directly or by attribution through relatives or entities having holder ownership interest of the total combined voting power of all classes of Company stock, the exercise price may not be less than
110% of the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at, and exercise periods may not exceed five years from, the option grant date. The
Compensation Committee determines the type of restrictions and purchase price, if any, for restricted stock awards based on, among other factors, achievement of financial, business and performance objectives, the occurrence of specific events, time
periods of continued service or other time-based restrictions. Restricted stock generally is not transferable until all applicable restrictions have lapsed or been satisfied. If restricted stock award recipients cease to perform services for the
Company, all shares of common stock still subject to restrictions generally will be forfeited unless waived by the Compensation Committee. Recipients of restricted stock generally will have certain rights and privileges of a stockholder, including
the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, if any. In 2005 through 2007, the exercise price of all stock options granted under the 2004 Plan was the fair
or trading value of the Companys common stock at grant date and all options expire ten years from grant date. Stock options granted in 2007 and 2006 vest in equal installments over three years. Stock options granted in 2005 vest in equal
installments over three years or immediately. All stock options granted in 2004 
originally vested in equal installments over three years and are now fully vested after acceleration of vesting in 2005 as further described below. Restricted stock
awards in 2007 and 2006 vest three years from date of award. There were no awards of restricted stock under the 2004 Plan in 2005. 1994 Stock Option Plan
The 1994 Stock Option Plan the 1994 Plan expired by its terms on December21, 2004, and no further options can be granted under that plan. Adoption of the 2004 Plan described above, and termination of the 1994 Plan, did not adversely
affect rights under any outstanding stock options previously granted under the 1994 Plan. All options granted to purchase shares under the 1994 Plan generally expire ten years from grant date. The exercise price of all stock options granted through
2004 was the fair or trading value of the Companys common stock at grant date. All stock options granted under the 1994 Plan are fully vested. Effective
October19, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved the accelerated vesting of all then outstanding unvested stock options granted under the 1994 Stock Option Plan and the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, and associated employee stock
option agreements were amended. All other terms and conditions of the options remain the same. Unvested options to purchase 485,850 shares of common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $3700 per share became exercisable upon vesting
acceleration. This accelerated vesting reduced non-cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following application of SFAS No123R, which was effective for the Company beginning January1, 2006. 
Formula Stock Option Plan for Directors The Formula Stock Option Plan was suspended in December 2007 and a proposed new plan, as further described below, is
subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting on April23, 2008. The Formula Stock Option Plan was for the benefit of the Companys outside directors. Prior to plan suspension, before February1 each year, individual outside
directors were awarded an option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the average fair market value per share for the ten day period prior to award. All options granted under this plan generally vested in six
months, and expired ten years, from grant date. The Company granted options under this plan to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock to each of five outside directors as of January2, 2007 at an exercise price per share of $3845 determined in
accordance with plan provisions. No options were granted under this plan in 2008. New 2008 Formula Restricted Stock Plan In December 2007, the SMI
Board of Directors, excluding non-employee 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 82  
directors, suspended the Formula Stock Option Plan and adopted a new 2008 Formula Restricted Stock Plan the 2008 Formula Plan subject to stockholder approval at the
Annual Meeting on April23, 2008. The 2008 Formula Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing non-employee directors with Company ownership interests to more closely align their interests with the
Companys stockholders and to enhance the Companys ability to attract and retain highly qualified non-employee directors. The 2008 Formula Plan is intended to constitute a formula plan within the meaning of SEC Rule 16b-3 of
the Exchange Act. Approval of the 2008 Formula Plan and termination of the Formula Stock Option Plan will not adversely affect rights under any outstanding stock options previously granted under the Formula Stock Option Plan. The 2008 Formula Plan
will be administered by the Board of Directors, excluding non-employee directors, and will expire by its terms in February 2018. The Board of Directors, excluding non-employee directors, may amend, suspend or terminate the 2008 Formula Plan in whole
or in part, provided that no such amendment, suspension or termination adversely affects previously granted awards without the consent of the award recipient. Any such amendment, suspension or termination may be subject to stockholder approval.
Under the proposed 2008 Formula Plan, 100,000 shares of SMIs common stock will be reserved for issuance and awards will be in the form of restricted stock. On
the first business day following each annual meeting, beginning with the Companys 2008 Annual Meeting, each non-employee director who is then a member of the Board shall receive a grant of restricted stock consisting of the number of shares
equaling $60,000 divided by the average market value of the common stock as of the grant date. Average market value is defined as the average of closing sale prices for the twenty days immediately preceding the grant gate, rounded up to the nearest
whole share. Grants of restricted stock fully vest on the earlier of ithe first grant date anniversary or iithe day before the Companys next annual meeting following the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service as a
director through scheduled vesting dates. Employee Stock Purchase Plan The SMI Employee Stock Purchase Plan the ESPP provides employees the
opportunity to acquire stock ownership in the Company. The authorized number of shares of common stock issuable under the ESPP is 800,000. At December31, 2007, approximately 439,000 shares are available for future grant. Prior to each
January1, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors determines whether eligible employees electing to participate will be granted the right to purchase shares of common stock for the upcoming calendar year and, if granted, the
number of shares available for purchase under each 
option. All employee grants are for the same number of shares and grant date. No participant can be granted the right to purchase more than 500 shares in each calendar
year, nor can an employee purchase stock under this or all other employee stock purchase plans in excess of $25,000 of fair market value at the grant date in each calendar year. The stock purchase price is 90% of the lesser of fair market value at
grant date or exercise date. Grants may be exercised once at the end of each calendar quarter, and unexercised grants expire at each calendar year end. No shares were granted to employees under the ESPP for calendar years 2007, 2006 or 2005.
Adoption of SFAS No123R Share-Based Payment As of January1, 2006, the Company implemented SFAS No123R
Share-Based Payment using the modified prospective method of transitioning to SFAS No123R, and began recognizing compensation expense related to stock option and other share-based compensation grants. Prior to January1,
2006, the Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation using APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related Interpretations, and applied the disclosure provisions of SFAS No148
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB No123 and presented the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share based on the fair value recognition provisions of
SFAS No123R for periods prior to adoption. Under the modified prospective transition method, share-based compensation cost is recognized for iunvested share-based awards granted before January1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair
value estimated using the original provisions of SFAS No123 and iishare-based awards granted after January1, 2006 based on grant-date fair value estimated using the provisions of SFAS No123R. All stock options granted
under the 1994 Plan and the 2004 Plan have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date, and under the Formula Stock Option Plan for Directors have an exercise price equal to the average fair market value
per share for the ten day period prior to award. Based on the terms of these stock option plans and the ESPP, no share-based compensation cost has been reflected in
net income for these plans prior to January1, 2006. The Companys practice has been to issue new shares upon option exercise; however, repurchases of shares in the open market are permitted. Adoption of SFAS No123R did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements, results of operations or cash flows, or the assumptions used for
computing grant-date fair values. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, share-based compensation expense totaled 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 83  
$1,825,000 and $998,000, before income taxes of $699,000 and $361,000, respectively, which is included in general and administrative expense. There were no significant
unvested awards granted to retirement-eligible employees prior to January1, 2006 that required compensation expense recognition. Prior period results were not restated. Prior to adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company presented the tax
benefits from stock option exercises in cash flows from operations on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards. SFAS No123R requires classification of cash flows resulting from such tax
benefits, including those pertaining to restricted stock awards, if any, in cash flows from financing activities on a prospective basis. In determining excess additional paid-in-capital upon adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company utilized the
simplified alternative provided in FASB Staff Position FAS 123R-3 Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share had the Company applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123R to share-based employee compensation for the year ended
December31, 2005. The fair value of stock option grants under the 1994 Plan, 2004 Plan and Formula Stock Option Plan is estimated using various factors and assumptions described below and amortized into expense over the associated vesting
periods in thousands, except per share amounts: 2005 Net income as reported 108,135 Less: Share-based compensation expense determined using fair value method for all awards net of
taxes 2,996 Pro forma net income 105,139 Basic earnings per share As reported 246 Pro forma 239 Diluted earnings per share As reported 245 Pro forma 238
There were no significant changes in the characteristics of restricted stock or stock options granted during 2007 as compared to prior grants and no modifications of the terms of
any share-based payment arrangements. There were no significant changes in estimates, assumptions or valuation methods used to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards. The fair value of stock option grants for the 1994 Plan, 2004 Plan
and Formula Stock Option Plan is estimated on grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model based on the following factors and assumptions. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from historical volatility of the
Companys stock and other factors. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises, forfeitures and employee terminations within the pricing model. Employee groups have similar historical exercise experience and are combined for
valuation purposes. The expected term of granted options is estimated based on historical exercise experience and represents the time period that granted options are expected to be outstanding. Risk-free interest rates for periods within the
expected life of options are based on the US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company believes the pricing model and approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate for estimating the fair values of
share-based awards. These fair value and other estimates are not intended to predict future events or value ultimately realizable by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of original
estimates.  2007 2006 2005 Options granted 60,000 125,000 148,000 Weighted averagegrant-date fair values 1236 1166 1106 Total intrinsic value of options exercised 1,898,000 4,528,000 3,565,000 Weighted average expected volatility 237 262 280 Weighted average risk-free interest rates 47 44 42 Weighted average expected lives inyears 66 60 46 Weighted average dividend yield 09 09 08  Speedway Motorsports, Inc.

14.PURCHASE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE MOTOR SPEEDWAY AND AMENDMENT OF BANK
CREDIT FACILITY IN JANUARY 2008 On January11, 2008, the Company purchased 100% of the outstanding stock of New Hampshire Speedway, Inc., d/b/a New Hampshire
International Speedway, for $340,000,000 in cash. The New Hampshire International Speedway is being renamed New Hampshire Motor Speedway NHMS. NHMS owns and operates a multi-use complex located in Loudon, New Hampshire, featuring a 1058-mile oval
superspeedway and a 16-mile road course on approximately 1,175 acres. The purchase also included 50% ownership interest in the outstanding stock of North Wilkesboro Speedway, Inc. NWS, which had an insignificant fair value. The Company has owned
the remaining 50% interest for several years.NWS has no operations and its assets consist primarily of real estate. NHMS has sanction agreements to host two NASCAR Sprint Cup and one NASCAR Nationwide Series races in 2008, among other events
and track rentals. The purchase of NHMS expands the Companys motorsports business into one of the largest media markets in North America. Management believes its facilities and racing events provide the Company with opportunities for
increasing revenues and profitability. The purchase price was funded with available cash and $300,000,000 in borrowings under the Companys amended Credit Facility as further described below. The acquisition will be accounted for using the
purchase method, and the results of operations after acquisition will be included in the Companys consolidated statements of income. On January10, 2008,
the Company amended its Credit Facility see Note 6 to increase the amount available for borrowing under revolving loans from $400,000,000 to 
$500,000,000, and to specifically exclude the NHMS purchase from the provision that aggregate cash consideration for the Companys motorsports industry related
transactions in any fiscal year could not exceed 35% of its consolidated net worth at the immediately preceding fiscal year end. After the purchase, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $398,438,000 and could borrow up to an additional
$99,700,000 under the amended Credit Facility as of January11, 2008. 15.PLANS FOR DISCONTINUING OIL AND
GAS OPERATIONS SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2007 In March 2008, because of the ongoing challenges with oil and gas activities, the Company is contemplating
discontinuing those operations during 2008, although no final decision has been made. As further described in Notes 2 and 10, those operations have been conducted primarily in foreign countries and particularly in Russia since the second quarter
2006. These oil and gas operations involve business, credit and other risks different from the Companys motorsports operations, and the ability to invest and compete successfully and profitably has been subject to many factors outside
managements control. Many operating risks and challenges involve difficult or restrictive governmental situations when attempting to conduct business, access or transfer assets or funds, or facilitate production and similar activities in
Russia and other foreign countries. If and when the Company decides to discontinue the oil and gas business, it would likely be presented as discontinued operations
and prior period financial statements will be reclassified when presented. As of December31, 2007, assets and liabilities associated with the oil and gas business consist primarily of: iinvested and capitalized amounts aggregating
$15,225,000 for two foreign entities owning certain oil and gas mineral rights in Russia $6,484,000 for OOO Visheraneft and $8,741,000 for OOO Vorga; iinet receivables of $2,886,000; and iiicurrent liabilities of $912,000. The
invested and capitalized amounts consist principally of capitalized costs for oil and gas mineral rights, road construction, and exploration and drilling predominately with unproven reserves and, to a lesser extent, proven reserves accounted for
under the full cost accounting method. At this time, the Company no longer plans to expand or increase its investment in connection with the two foreign entities or
make other foreign investments except as described herein. The Company may decide or be required to spend certain additional amounts or take legal actions to protect or preserve its interests in oil and gas mineral rights and maintain or maximize
the potential recovery value of proven and unproven reserves, and to protect other aspects 
Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 89  
of the Companys oil and gas investments. This may include entering into other contracts or joint venture arrangements depending on perceived opportunities for
maintaining or maximizing potential recovery value. Such additional expenditures, although presently undeterminable, could become material depending on the facts, circumstances and ultimate outcome of any attempted recovery or resolution. Those
costs, if significant and ultimately not recovered, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys future financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Although discontinuation plans are being formulated, many or most of the
risk and other factors discussed herein remain relevant to the Companys oil and gas business activities.

Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act, Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e. The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this
Annual Report, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in such reports is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The following is managements conclusion and report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007:  MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING March 13, 2008 The management of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. is responsible for establishing
and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f. A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys
board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
cannot provide absolute assurance, it is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by
collusion or improper management override of controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.
However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.  Speedway Motorsports, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K 90  The management of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. assessed the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria established
