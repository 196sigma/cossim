Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31,
2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March6, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNGLLP Redwood

Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
In this Annual Report on Form10-K, Rigel, we, us and our refer to Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. and common stock refers to
Rigel common stock, par value $0001 per share. 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Nature of operations and basis of presentation 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on June14, 1996. We are engaged in the discovery and development of novel,
small-molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as for muscle disorders.  Financial statement preparation 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include those relating to the terms of our research and development collaborations
i.e.revenue recognition of upfront fees and certain contingent payments, investments, stock-based compensation, impairment issues, estimated useful life of assets, estimated accruals and
contingencies. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made, however
actual results could differ from these estimates. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. 
Stock award plans 
We have three stock option plans, our 2011 Equity Incentive Plan 2011 Plan, 2000 Equity Incentive Plan 2000 Plan and 2000
Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan Directors' Plan, that provide for granting to our officers, directors and all other employees and consultants options to purchase shares of our
common stock. Under the plans, we may issue non-qualified options or incentive stock options. We also have our Purchase Plan, where eligible employees can purchase shares of our common
stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. The benefits provided under
these plans are stock-based payments subject to the provisions of FASB ASC 718, ASC505-50 and guidance under the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
SAB No107 and SAB No110. 
Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities 
We consider all highly liquid investments in debt securities with maturity from the date of purchase of 90days or less to be
cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, U.S. treasury bills, corporate bonds and commercial paper and investments in government-sponsored enterprises. Our
available-for-sale investments include obligations of government-sponsored enterprises and corporate bonds and commercial paper. By policy, we limit the concentration of credit
risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers. 
All
cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value at December31, 2011 and 2010. Unrealized gains losses are reported in stockholders' equity and included in other comprehensive income loss. Fair value is
estimated based on available market information or valuation methodologies. The cost of 
54

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued  1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
securities
sold is based on the specific identification method. See Note5 for a summary of available-for-sale securities at December31, 2011 and 2010. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying values of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those
instruments. Cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value at December31, 2011 and 2010. The carrying values of capital lease obligations
approximate fair value due to similar financing arrangements being available to us at market interest rates. 
Concentration of credit risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and
available-for-sale securities. Cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, U. S. treasury bills,
government-sponsored enterprise securities, and corporate bonds and commercial paper. Due to the mostly short-term nature of these investments, we believe we do not have a material
exposure to credit risk arising from our investments. All cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are maintained with financial institutions that management
believes are creditworthy. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
term of the lease, whichever is shorter. 
Revenue recognition 
We present revenue from our collaboration arrangements under FASB ASC 808, Collaboration
Arrangements. Our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under FASB ASC605-25, Multiple-Element
Arrangements as amended by ASU 2009-13, and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has
standalone value to the customer, whether the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered element and whether delivery or performance of the undelivered element is
considered probable and substantially under our control. Following the adoption of ASU 2009-13 on January1, 2011, consideration we receive under collaboration arrangements is
allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the selling price hierarchy, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments
received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned. 
Revenues
related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each agreement.
Under these agreements, we are generally required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement. The payments received are not refundable and are generally
based on a contractual cost per full-time equivalent employee working on the project. Our research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate the
revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements. It is our policy to recognize 
55 
Table of Contents Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
revenue
based on our level of effort expended, however, revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the agreement. 
Revenues
associated with substantive, at-risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized upon achievement of the milestones. We consider a milestone to be
substantive at the inception of the arrangement if it is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item as a result of a
specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone, it relates solely to past performance and it is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the
arrangement. Non-refundable contingent future amounts receivable in connection with future events specified in collaboration agreements that are not considered milestones will be
recognized as revenue when payments are earned from our collaborators through completion of any underlying performance obligations, the amounts are fixed or determinable and collectability is
reasonably assured. 
Research and development expenses 
Research and development expenses include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, consultants, research sponsored by us,
allocated facility costs, costs related to pre-clinical and clinical trials, and stock-based compensation expense. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as
incurred. Collaboration agreements generally specify minimum levels of research effort required to be performed by us. 
Research and development accruals 
We have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities. Costs that are incurred but not billed
to us as of the end of the period are accrued. We make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of the nature of the contractual
activities generating such costs. Clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity reported by third parties. Expenses related to other research and development contracts, such
as research contracts, toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contracts. Raw
materials and study materials purchased for us by third parties are expensed at the time of purchase. 
Contingencies 
We are subject to claims related to the patent protection of certain of our technologies, as well as a purported securities class
action lawsuit and other litigation. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of
the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue. 
Income Taxes 
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
56 
Table of Contents Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued 
enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount whose realization is more likely than
not. 
Net income loss per share 
Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and the
number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive securities include warrants and stock options and
other shares issuable under our Purchase Plan. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Under the
treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of our common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from potentially dilutive securities. 
The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income loss per share in thousands except per share amounts:

Recent accounting pronouncements 
In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-11 related to the disclosures on offsetting of assets and liabilities
thereby amending ASC 210, Balance Sheet. The amendments require us to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of
our financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position. ASU No 2011-11 is effective on or after January1, 2013 and will be applied
retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of adopting ASU 2011-11 and cannot estimate the impact of adoption
at this time. 
In
June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-05 for the presentation of comprehensive income thereby amending ASC 220, Comprehensive
Income. The amendments require that all non-owner changes in stockholders' equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in
two separate but consecutive statements. The amendments are effective in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. In December 2011, the FASB issued
ASU No2011-12 to defer the effective date of certain amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of the accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU No
2011-05 to allow the FASB time to redeliberate on the matter. ASU No2011-12 is effective at the same time as the amendments in ASU No2011-05. We
adopted the amendments on January1, 2012. These amendments will impact the presentation of our financial statements upon adoption. 
In
May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-04 thereby amending ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, to achieve common fair
value measurement and disclosure requirements in U.S.GAAP and IFRS. The amendments result in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between U.S.GAAP and IFRS, and
clarify the application of existing fair value measurements and requirements regarding the disclosure of information about fair value measurements. The amendments are effective in fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2011 and will be applied prospectively. We adopted the amendments on January1, 2012 on a prospective basis. We evaluated the impact of adopting ASU
No2011-04 and believe it will have no material effect on our financial statements. 
58  
Table of Contents Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued  In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No2010-17 thereby amending ASC 605 for revenue recognition related to the milestone method of revenue recognition. ASU
No2010-17 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development
arrangements. A company may make an accounting policy election to use the milestone method of revenue recognition for transactions within the scope of the amendments. The amendments are effective in
fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, and early adoption is permitted. We
adopted the amendments on January1, 2011 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU No2010-17 had no material effect on our financial statements. 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No2009-13 on ASC 605 for revenue recognition related to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. ASU
No2009-13 provides amendments to the existing criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements. The amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for
determining the selling price of a deliverable, eliminate the residual method of allocation of arrangement consideration to deliverables and require the use of the relative selling price method in the
allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables, require the determination of the best estimate of a selling price in a consistent manner, and significantly expand the disclosures related
to multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The amendments are effective in fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, and early adoption is permitted. We adopted the amendments on
January1, 2011 on a prospective basis. The adoption of ASU No2009-13 had no material effect on our financial statements. 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS  We conduct research and development programs independently and in connection with our corporate collaborators. We currently have the following significant active collaborations with two
major pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies: AZ, relating to fostamatinib for the treatment of RA and other indications, and Daiichi, relating to oncology. Neither of these collaborations currently
provides us with regular reimbursement of research expenses. In both of these collaborations, if certain conditions are met, we are entitled to receive future payments and royalties. We cannot
guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful. As a result, we may not receive any further payments or royalties under these agreements.  AstraZeneca  In February 2010, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with AZ for the development and commercialization of our
oral SYK inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction. The agreement includes a license of rights to fostamatinib,
previously known as R788, our late-stage investigational product candidate for the treatment of RA and other indications. AZ is responsible for conducting and funding all future
development, regulatory filings, manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing most of our oral SYK inhibitors. The agreement became effective on March26, 2010 and we
received an upfront payment from AZ of $1000million in April 2010. 
Under
the agreement, our deliverables were: igranting a license of rights to fostamatinib, iitransfer of technology know-how related to fostamatinib,
and iiiconducting, at our expense, the fostamatinib open label extension study until it was transferred to AZ on September25, 2010. We concluded that these deliverables should be
accounted for as one single unit of accounting and we 
59 
Table of Contents Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS Continued 
recognized
the $1000million upfront payment received in April 2010 from AZ ratably over the performance period from March26, 2010, the effective date of the agreement, through
September25, 2010, the completion date of the last deliverable, which was the transfer of the fostamatinib long-term open label extension study to AZ. We elected a
straight-line method for recognition of this upfront payment as the effort to advance and transfer the study was fairly consistent over the transition period. On
September29, 2010, we announced that we earned $250million from AZ for completing the transfer of the fostamatinib long-term open label extension study to
AZ and for the initiation of Phase3 clinical trials in the fostamatinib program by AZ. AZ is required to pay us up to an additional $3200million if specified development, regulatory
and launch events are achieved for fostamatinib. We are also eligible to receive up to an additional $8000million if specified sales levels are achieved for fostamatinib, as well as
significant stepped double-digit royalties on net worldwide sales, if any. Future events that may trigger payments to us under the AZ agreement are based solely on AZ future efforts and achievements
of milestones. 
Either
party may terminate the agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured for 60days after the date of notice of such breach,
or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the agreement in its entirety if AZ challenges the
validity, enforceability or scope of any of our patents licensed to AZ by us under the agreement. AZ may also terminate the agreement either 1without cause upon 180days written
notice or 2upon 30days written notice in the event of any change of control of Rigel. If neither party terminates the agreement, then the agreement will remain in effect until the
cessation of all commercial sales of all products subject to the agreement, including fostamatinib.  Daiichi Sankyo  In August 2002, we signed an agreement for a collaboration with Daiichi to pursue research related to a specific target from a novel
class of drug targets called ligases that control cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation. Daiichi paid us $09million at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement.
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, the aggregate of potential amounts payable to us is $339million and we are entitled to receive royalties on any commercialized products to
emerge from the collaboration, if any, at low to mid-single-digit royalties on sales. In January 2012, we were notified by Daiichi that it has achieved the second designation of a rational
lead compound and paid us a contingent fee of $750,000. We have earned to date payments totaling $65million and may earn additional payments in connection with certain clinical events. The
research phase of this three-year collaboration expired in August 2005. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we retain the rights to co-develop and
co-promote certain products resulting from this collaboration in North America, while Daiichi retains co-development and promotion rights in the remainder of the world. Future
events that may trigger payments to us under the Daiichi agreement are based solely on Daiichi future efforts and achievements of milestones. Either
party may terminate the collaboration agreement if the other party materially breaches the agreement and such breach remains uncured after notice of such breach, or after a
specified period from the end of a designated research period if no product is commercialized unless the parties agree to extend the collaboration. The collaboration agreement can also be terminated
by mutual written consent of the parties. If neither party exercises its option to terminate the collaboration agreement, then the agreement automatically terminates on the later of 1the
expiration of the last patent with a

that covers the composition of matter of a product or manufacture or use of a product under certain circumstances and 2after a specified period from the initial commercialization of
a licensed product.  Other Agreements  In May 2011, we announced that Pfizer returned full rights to the program for R343, an oral SYK inhibitor small molecule that blocks
IgE receptor signaling, to us as a result of its decision to exit the allergy and respiratory therapeutic area within research and development. The collaborative research and license agreement that we
had entered into with them was terminated. 
In
July 2011, we received a $43million final payment from Merck Serono. The final payment from Merck Serono was for the collaboration agreement that was terminated in 2010 and
all licenses to aurora kinase inhibitors reverted back to us. The payment did not qualify as a substantive milestone as it related solely to the past performance of Merck Serono. We recognized the
receipt of $43million as revenue in 2011. 
In
June 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BerGenBio for the development and commercialization of an oncology program. BerGenBio is responsible for all activities
it wishes to perform under the license granted. BerGenBio paid us an upfront payment of $500,000 in August 2011. Under the agreement, our deliverables were: igranting a license of rights to
our oncology program, and iidelivery of a small batch of compound to BerGenBio. We concluded that these deliverables should be accounted for as separate units of accounting. We used
management best estimate of selling price in the allocation of the upfront payment and recognized revenue of $500,000 for the year ended December31, 2011. This oncology program was developed
before we focused our research and development efforts on inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, as well as muscle disorders. 
3. SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS  For the year ended December31, 2011, Merck Serono and BerGenBio accounted for 89% and 11% of
our revenues, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2010, AZ accounted for 100% of our revenues. For the year ended December31, 2009, Daiichi accounted for 100% of our revenues.
At December31, 2011 and 2010, we had no accounts receivable. We do not require collateral or other security for accounts receivable.

In
February 2009, we announced that we cut our research programs in virology and oncology as well as terminated certain related development and administrative staff, which resulted in
the dismissal of 36 employees, or approximately 20% of our workforce. This measure was intended to maintain our emphasis on our active preclinical and clinical programs, while conserving our
resources. As part of a package we offered the terminated employees, we extended the date the terminated employees had to exercise their vested options to December31, 2009 rather than
90days from the termination date as is
typically required under our 2000 Plan. We recorded $122,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to this modification in the first quarter of 2009. 
Employee stock option plans 
In 2011, we adopted our 2011 Plan which was approved in May 2011 by our stockholders, ito establish a reserve of shares
authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan of 3,500,000 shares of common stock, iiprovide that the number of shares available for issuance under the 2011 Plan shall be reduced by one share
for each share of common stock subject to a stock option or stock appreciation right with a strike price of at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date and
by 17 shares for each share of common stock subject to any other type of award issued pursuant to the 2011 Plan, and iiiestablish an equity plan that specifically excludes our Chief
Executive Officer as an eligible participant. Options granted under our 2011 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Options may be granted with different vesting terms from time
to time, ranging from zero to five years. As of December31, 2011, a total of 3,500,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan. No options to purchase shares
were exercised during the year ended December31, 2011. 
In
2011, an amendment to the 2000 Plan was approved primarily to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 600,000 shares to an aggregate total of 13,610,403 and
iiprovide that the number of shares available for issuance under the 2000 Plan shall be reduced by one share for each share of common stock subject to a stock option or stock appreciation
right with a strike price of at least 100% of the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the grant date and by 17 shares for each share of common stock subject to any other type of award
issued pursuant to the 2000 Plan. In 2010, an amendment to the 2000 Plan was approved primarily to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 1,250,000 shares. Options granted under our
2000 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. Options may be granted with different vesting terms from time to time, ranging from zero to five years. As of December31, 2011,
a total of 11,824,901 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Options to purchase 114,988 shares were exercised during the year ended December31, 2011. 
In
2011, an amendment to the Directors' Plan was approved primarily to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 250,000 shares to an aggregate total of 1,135,000 shares.
In 2010, the Directors' Plan was amended, primarily to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 350,000 shares. The exercise price of options under the Directors' Plan is equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of the options granted under the Directors' Plan is ten years. As of December31, 2011, a total of 1,132,211 shares
of common stock were authorized for issuance under the Directors' Plan. No options to purchase shares were exercised during the year ended December31, 2011.

Pursuant
to FASB ASC 718, we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs. We estimated the forfeiture rate using our historical
experience with pre-vesting options. We adjust our stock-based compensation expense as actual forfeitures occur, review our estimated forfeiture rates each quarter and make changes to our
estimate as appropriate. 
The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have segregated option awards into the following three homogenous
groups for the purposes of determining fair values of options: officers and directors, all other employees, and consultants. 
We
determined weighted-average valuation assumptions separately for each of these groups as follows VolatilityWe estimated volatility using the historical share price performance over the expected life of the
option up to the point where we have historical market data. We also considered other factors, such as implied volatility, our current clinical trials and other company activities that may affect the
volatility of our stock in the future. We determined that at this time historical volatility is more indicative of our expected future stock performance than implied volatility. 
Expected termFor options granted to consultants, we use the contractual term of the option, which is
generally ten years, for the initial valuation of the option and the remaining contractual term of the option for the succeeding periods. We worked with various historical data to determine the
applicable expected term for each of the other option groups. This data included: 1for exercised options, the term of the options from option grant date to exercise date; 2for
cancelled options, the term of the options from option grant date to cancellation date, excluding unvested option forfeitures; and 3for options that remained outstanding at the balance sheet
date, the term of the options from option grant date to the end of the reporting period and the estimated remaining term of the options. The consideration and calculation of the above data gave us
reasonable estimates of the expected term for each employee group. We also considered the vesting schedules of the options granted and factors surrounding exercise behavior of the option groups, our
current market price and company activity that may affect our market price. In addition, we considered the optionee type i.e.,officers and directors or all other employees and other factors
that may affect the expected term of the option. 
Risk-free interest rateThe risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury constant
maturity rates with similar terms to the expected term of the options for each option group. The recent downgrade by SP in the credit rating for the U.S. long-term sovereign debt did not
affect our basis for the risk-free interest rate. 
Dividend yieldThe expected dividend yield is 0% as we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the
future.

Options
are priced at the market price of our common stock on the date immediately preceding the date of grant, become exercisable at varying dates and generally expire ten years from
the date of grant. At December31, 2011, options to purchase 4,707,753 shares of common stock were available for grant and 16,457,112 reserved shares of common stock were available for future
issuance under our stock option plans. 
For
the year ended December31, 2011, there was no stock-based compensation expense associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value valuation and periodic
fair value re-measurement of outstanding consultant options under FASB ASC 505-50. We recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $31,000 and $99,000 for the
years ended December31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, associated with options granted to consultants. The valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other
assumptions, including the expected future volatility of our stock price, risk-free interest rate and expected term. We amortized stock-based compensation related to consultants using a
straight-line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of FASB ASC 718. No options to purchase shares
granted to consultants were exercised during the year ended December31, 2011.

Weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $463, $614 and $465, respectively. 
The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of our common stock for the options that were
in-the-money at December31, 2011. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our stock
option plans was approximately $201,000, $122,000 and $619,000, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. 
As
of December31, 2011, there was approximately $28million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock-based
compensation arrangements granted under our stock option plans and approximately $135,000 of total unamortized compensation cost related to our Purchase Plan. The unamortized compensation cost related
to our stock option plans and our Purchase Plan is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 243years and 050years, respectively. We also had
approximately 766,425 and 759,726 of unvested stock options with intrinsic value of approximately $699,000 and $253,000, at

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In August 2000, we adopted our Purchase Plan which was approved in September 2000 by our stockholders. The Purchase Plan permits
eligible employees to purchase
common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the common
stock on the first day of the offering or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date. The initial offering period commenced on the effective date of our initial public
offering. We issued 247,880, 228,585 and 196,038 shares of common stock during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, pursuant to the Purchase Plan at an average price of $608, $609 and $667 per share,
respectively. For 2011, 2010 and 2009, the weighted average fair value of stock purchased under the Purchase Plan was $296, $373 and $484, respectively. As of December31, 2011, we had
737,428 reserved shares of common stock available for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. 
The
fair value of awards granted under our Purchase Plan is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses weighted- average assumptions. Our
Purchase Plan provides for a twenty-four month offering period comprised of four six-month purchase periods with a look-back option. A look-back option
is a provision in our Purchase Plan under which eligible employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the first day of
the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Our Purchase Plan also includes a feature that provides for a new offering period to begin when the fair market value of our
common stock on any purchase date during an offering period falls below the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of such offering period. This feature is called a reset.
Participants are automatically enrolled in the new offering period.

available-for-sale securities on our balance sheet even though the stated maturity date of these securities may be more than
one year from the current balance sheet date. We have the ability to hold all investments as of December31, 2011 to maturity. Recently, the credit rating for the U.S. long-term
sovereign debt was downgraded by SP. Given the short duration of our investment portfolio, we believe that such downgrade did not materially affect the value of our
available-for-sale securities as of December31, 2011. At December31, 2011 and 2010, we had no investments that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position
for more than twelve months. As of December31, 2011, a total of 33 individual securities had been in an unrealized loss position for twelve months or less and the losses were deemed to be

6. FAIR VALUE  Under FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a
liability transferred in a transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Where available, fair value is based on
observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or parameters are not available, valuation models are applied. 
Assets
and liabilities recorded at fair value in our financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.
Hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follows: Level1Inputs
are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability
occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. 
The
fair valued assets we hold that are generally included under this Level1 are money market securities where fair value is based on publicly quoted prices. 
Level2Are
inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level1, that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market
data at the reporting date and for the duration of the instrument anticipated life. 
The
fair valued assets we hold that are generally assessed under Level2 included government-sponsored enterprise securities, U. S. treasury bills and corporate bonds and commercial paper. We
utilize third party pricing services in developing fair value measurements where fair value is based on valuation methodologies such as models using observable market inputs, including benchmark
yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, bids, offers and other reference data. We use quotes from external pricing service providers and other on-line quotation systems to verify
the fair value of investments provided by our third party pricing service providers. We review independent auditor reports from our third party pricing service providers particularly regarding the
controls over pricing and valuation of financial instruments and ensure that our internal controls address certain control deficiencies, if any, and complementary user entity controls are in place. 
Level3Unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities and which reflect management
best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the reporting date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk
inherent in the inputs to the model. 69  Table of Contents Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc.

In
March 2009, we amended our build-to-suit lease agreement with our landlord, HCP BTC,LLC formerly known as Slough BTC,LLC, to defer certain
rental obligations in the aggregate amount of $69 million for a period of up to seventeen months. Under the terms of this amendment, we were obligated to repay the deferred rental amounts, including
interest accruing at 12% during the deferral period, based on a timeline that could vary depending upon the occurrence of certain financing or collaborative transactions. We reevaluated the lease
amendment under FASB ASC 840 and determined that the amended lease still qualified as an operating lease. In addition, the amendment to the lease agreement also provided for the cancellation of an
existing warrant granting HCP Estates USAInc. an affiliate of our landlord the right to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock and the issuance of a new warrant granting our landlord the
right to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price per share of the new warrant is $661, which is the average closing price of our common stock for the three business days
immediately preceding the execution of the amendment to the lease agreement. The new warrant remains exercisable for 7years from the date of issuance. We applied modification accounting and
calculated an incremental fair market value of the new warrant of $616,000. This amount has been deferred in other long-term assets and is being amortized into rent expense over the
remaining term of the lease. On September22, 2009, we completed an underwritten public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $1015million after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As a result of this financing, we paid our landlord $37million, or 50% of the deferred rental amounts, plus interest at 12%, in November 2009.
In February 2010, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with AZ in which we received an upfront payment of $1000 million in April 2010. As a result of this additional
cash received, we paid our landlord $39 million, or the remaining 50% of the deferred rental amounts, plus interest at 12%, in April 2010. Rent
expense under our operating lease amounted to approximately $148million, $152million and $156million for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively.

shares,
to establish from time to time the number of shares constituting any such series, and to increase or decrease the number of shares, if any. 
Common Stock 
In June 2011, we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold 18,745,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to an
effective registration statement at a price to the public of $800 per share. We received net proceeds of approximately $1405million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses. 
Warrants 
In conjunction with the facilities lease entered into in May 2001, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase 16,666 shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of $8021 per share, a 15% premium to market at the time of issuance. This warrant expired in May 2006. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined using the
Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $683,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term assets and is being amortized into expense over the life of the lease. As of
December31, 2011, approximately $277,000 remained to be amortized over the term of the lease. 
In
conjunction with the facilities lease amendment in October 2002, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase 55,555 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1773 per
share. The warrant expired in October 2007. The fair value of this warrant, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $565,000. This amount has been capitalized in other
long-term assets and is being amortized into expense over the life of the lease. As of December31, 2011, approximately $229,000 remained to be amortized over the term of the lease. In
conjunction with the facilities lease amendment in July 2006, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1057 per
share. The fair value of this warrant, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $801,000. This amount has been included in other long-term assets and is
being amortized into expense over the term of the lease. As of December31, 2011, approximately $421,000 remained to be amortized over the term of the lease. The
build-to-suit lease agreement was further amended in March 2009. The lease amendment provided for the cancellation of the abovementioned warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of
common stock and the issuance of a new warrant granting our landlord the right to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price per share of the new warrant is $661. The new warrant is
outstanding as of December31, 2011 and remains exercisable at any time up to February 2016. We applied modification accounting and determined the fair value of this warrant using the
Black-Scholes valuation model. The incremental fair market value of the new warrant as a result of the modification is $616,000. This amount has been included in other long-term assets and
is being amortized into expense over the term of
the lease. As of December31, 2011, approximately $424,000 remained to be amortized over the term of the lease.

10. INCOME TAXES  For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our income loss before income taxes was from domestic operations. For the year ended December31, 2011, we did not
record a provision for income taxes due to our net loss. For the year ended December31, 2010, we did not record a provision for income taxes because of the utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards for federal tax purposes and manufacturing investment credits for state tax purposes. For the year ended December31, 2009, we
recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $93,000 related to a refund of research tax credits as provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. 
Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets are as follows in thousands:

10. INCOME TAXES Continued 
As
of December31, 2011, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $4414 million, which expire beginning in the year 2023 and state
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2348 million, which expire beginning in the year 2014. We
also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately $94 million, which begin to expire in the year 2018 and state research and development tax credits of
approximately $175 million, which have no expiration date. 
Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully
offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $345 million for the year ended December31, 2011 and decreased by approximately $139 million for the year
ended December31, 2010. 
Included
in the valuation allowance balance at December31, 2011 and 2010 is approximately $25 million of tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options prior to the
adoption of ASC 718 which have not reflected as an expense for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, any future reduction in the valuation allowance relating to this amount will be credited
directly to equity and not reflected as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations. As a result of certain realization requirements, the table of deferred tax assets and liabilities shown
above does not include loss carryforward tax assets of approximately $17 million at December31, 2011 and 2010 that arose directly from or the use of which was postponed by tax deductions
related to stock-based compensation expense in excess of compensation expense recognized for financial reporting. Equity will be increased by approximately $17 million if and when such deferred tax
assets are ultimately realized. 
Utilization
of our net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state
provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses before utilization. 
The
following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits in thousands:

We
do not anticipate a significant change to the unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months. 
We
are subject to taxation in the United States and in California. Because of net operating loss and research credit carryovers, substantially all of our tax years remain open to
examination.

Our
policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. We currently have no tax positions that would be
subject to interest or penalties. 
11. CONTINGENCIES  On February6, 2009, a purported securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants us
and certain of our officers, directors and underwriters for our February 2008 public offering of common stock Stock Offering. An additional purported securities class action lawsuit containing
similar allegations was subsequently filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on February20, 2009. By order of the Court dated March19, 2009,
the two lawsuits were consolidated into a single action. On June9, 2009, the Court issued an order naming the Inter-Local Pension Fund GCC/IBT as lead plaintiff and Robbins Geller
Rudman DowdLLP formerly Coughlin Stoia as lead counsel. The lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on July24, 2009. We filed a motion to dismiss on
September8, 2009. On December21, 2009, the Court granted our motion and dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed its consolidated amended complaint on
January27, 2010. The lawsuit alleged violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by us related to the results of the
Phase2a clinical trial of our product candidate fostamatinib then known as R788. The plaintiff sought damages, including rescission or rescissory damages for purchasers in the Stock
Offering, an award of their costs and injunctive and/or equitable relief for purchasers of our common stock during the period between December13, 2007 and February9, 2009, including
purchasers in the Stock Offering. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint on February16, 2010. On August24, 2010, the Court issued an order granting our motion
and dismissed the consolidated complaint with leave to amend. On September22, 2010, plaintiff filed a notice informing the Court that it will not amend its complaint and requested that the
Court enter a final judgment. On October28, 2010, the plaintiff submitted a proposed judgment requesting entry of such judgment in favor of the defendants. On November1, 2010, judgment
was entered dismissing the action. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on November15, 2010 to the Circuit Court appealing the district court order granting our motion to dismiss the
consolidated amended complaint. The plaintiff filed its opening brief on February23, 2011. We filed our opposition brief on April8, 2011. On May9, 2011, the plaintiff filed its
reply brief. On February17, 2012, the Circuit Court heard oral arguments on plaintiff appeal. 
We
believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously. This lawsuit and any other related lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the
actual costs to be incurred relating to the lawsuit will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of the litigation is necessarily uncertain and we could be forced to expend significant resources
in the defense of this suit, and we may not prevail. Monitoring and defending legal actions is time consuming for our management
and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with the litigation. We are not
currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from this matter, if any, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve this matter or the possible amount of any damages that we may be
required to pay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to this lawsuit.

A
reserve may be required in the future due to new developments with respect to the pending lawsuit, patent claims or changes in approach such as a change in or establishment of a
settlement strategy in dealing with these matters, when a loss becomes probable and is estimable. 
12. QUALIFYING THERAPEUTIC DISCOVERY PROJECT GRANTS  In October 2010, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that we had been certified to receive a total cash grant of approximately $24 million related to the previously filed
applications under the Qualifying Therapeutic Discovery Projects Section48D of the Internal Revenue Code. Of this amount, approximately $300,000 and $21 million was actually received in
2011 and 2010, respectively. We recognized the total grant of $24 million as other income in our 2010 statement of operations.  13. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule13a-15e promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the
end of the period covered by this Annual Report. 
Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Exchange Act Rules13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. 
The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst YoungLLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in its attestation report which is set forth below in this Annual Report on Form10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the
COSO criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of
December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 of Rigel
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. and our report dated March6, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/
