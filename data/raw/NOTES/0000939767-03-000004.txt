Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements             45         REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Exelixis, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Exelixis, Inc.
as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Exelixis, Inc. at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
As discussed in Note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other intangible
assets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company
Exelixis, Inc. Exelixis or the Company is a biotechnology company whose
primary mission is to develop proprietary human therapeutics by leveraging its
integrated discovery platform to increase the speed, efficiency and quality of
pharmaceutical product discovery and development. The Company uses comparative
genomics and model system genetics to find new drug targets that Exelixis
believes would be difficult or impossible to uncover using other experimental
approaches. The Company research is designed to identify novel genes and
proteins expressed by those genes, that, when changed, either decrease or
increase the activity in a specific disease pathway in a therapeutically
relevant manner. These genes and proteins represent either potential product
targets or drugs that may treat disease or prevent disease initiation or
progression. The Company most advanced proprietary pharmaceutical program
focuses on drug discovery and development of small molecules in cancer. While
the Company proprietary programs focus on drug discovery and development,
Exelixis believes that its proprietary technologies are valuable to other
industries whose products can be enhanced by an understanding of DNA or
proteins, including the agrochemical, agricultural and diagnostic industries.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
The Company records its minority ownership interests in Genoptera LLC and
Agrinomics LLC using the equity method of accounting.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company invests its
excess cash in high-grade, short-term commercial paper and money market funds,
which invest in United States U.S. Treasury securities that are subject to
minimal credit and market risk.
All short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and therefore
carried at fair value. The Company views its available-for-sale portfolio as
available for use in current operations. Accordingly, the Company has classified
all investments as short-term, even though the stated maturity date may be one
year or more beyond the current balance sheet date. Available-for-sale
securities are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices of the
securities. Unrealized gains and losses on such securities, when material, are
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and
losses, net, on available-for-sale securities are included in interest income.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are
included in interest income. The following summarizes available-for-sale securities included in cash and cash
equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in thousands                              December 31,

Net unrealized gains were $906,000 and $601,000 as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Gross unrealized gains and losses have not been shown
separately as they were immaterial. Realized gains amounted to $65,000 in 2002 84,000 in 2001 and none in 2000.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, generally three to seven
years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated
useful life or the remaining term of the lease. Equipment held under capital
lease is stated at the lower of the cost of the related asset or the present
value of the minimum lease payments and is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Repairs and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets have been amortized using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives  Developed technology              3 - 5 years
Patents/core technology             15 years
Assembled workforce 2001 and prior      3 years
Goodwill 2001 and prior           15 years
Beginning in 2002, the Company has applied the new rules of accounting for
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
SFAS 142. Accordingly, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives are no longer amortized and are subject to annual impairment
tests.
Long-lived Assets
The Company accounts for its long-lived assets under SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS 144 adopted on
January 1, 2002. SFAS 144 supersedes SFAS 121, Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of SFAS 121.
SFAS 144 retains the requirements of SFAS 121 to recognize an impairment loss
only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its
undiscounted cash flows. During 2001, there was an impairment of goodwill under
SFAS 121 related to the Genomica purchase as detailed in Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the
difference between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
respective financial reporting amounts at enacted tax rates in effect for the
periods in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance
is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
expected to be realized.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due
to their short maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the
Company for loans and capital lease obligations with similar terms, the carrying
value of the Company debt obligations approximates fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of
credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
investments in marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable
securities consist of money market funds, taxable commercial paper, corporate
bonds with high credit quality, U.S. government agency obligations and auction
rate securities. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are
maintained with financial institutions that management believes are
creditworthy. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are concentrated
in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Accordingly, the Company
may be exposed to credit risk generally associated with pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies. The Company has had no bad debt since inception.
For the year ended December 31, 2002, revenue from two of the Company
collaborators represented approximately 39% and 25% of total revenue,
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2001, revenue from three of the
Company collaborators represented approximately 32%, 31% and 15% of total
revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2000, revenue from two
of the Company collaborators represented approximately 53% and 36% of total
revenue, respectively.
Revenue Recognition
License, research commitment and other non-refundable payments received in
connection with research collaboration agreements are deferred and recognized on
a straight-line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreements,
generally the research term. Contract research revenues are recognized as
services are performed pursuant to the terms of the agreements. Any amounts
received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue. Payments
are not refundable if research is not successful.
Milestone payments are non-refundable and recognized as revenue over the period
of the research arrangement. This typically results in a portion of the
milestone being recognized at the date the milestone is achieved, and the
balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement.
Revenues from chemistry collaborations are generally recognized upon the
delivery of accepted compounds.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include costs
associated with research performed pursuant to collaborative agreements.
Research and development costs consist of direct and indirect internal costs
related to specific projects as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct
certain research activities on behalf of the Company.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company manages exposures to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates
for its foreign operations through a program of risk management adopted in 2002
that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company utilizes
derivative financial instruments solely to hedge identified exposures and by
policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculative or trading
purposes. The Company derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair
value and are included in other current assets or accrued expenses.
The Company enters into foreign currency exchange combination option contracts
denominated in European Union Euro Euro to minimize the effect of foreign
exchange rate movements on the cash flows related to the Company payments to
one of its German subsidiaries for services provided by the subsidiary. The
Company has designated these derivatives as foreign currency cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income and reclassified
into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction impacts
earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of
the cumulative change in the present value of the future cash flows of the
hedged item, if any, is recognized in other income or expense in current
earnings in each reporting period.
If a cash flow hedge were to be discontinued because it is probable that the
original hedged transaction will not occur as anticipated, the unrealized gains
or losses would be reclassified into earnings. Subsequent gains or losses on
the related derivative instrument would be recognized in income in each period
until the instrument matures, is terminated or is sold.
During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company did not recognize any gain
or loss related to the ineffective portion of the hedging instruments and
reclassified a gain of $227,000 from other comprehensive income into earnings
under the caption, Research and development expense. As of December 31, 2002,
the Company expects to reclassify $119,000 of net gains on derivative
instruments from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings over the
next 12 months as a result of the payment of foreign currency to its German
subsidiaries.
Net Loss Per Share
Basic and diluted net loss per share are computed by dividing the net loss for
the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period adjusted for shares that are subject to repurchase. The
calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common stock
because their effect is antidilutive. Potential common stock consists of common
stock subject to repurchase, incremental common shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options and warrants and shares issuable upon conversion of
the convertible promissory note.
The following table sets forth potential shares of common stock that are not
included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because to do so would
be antidilutive for the periods indicated                      Year Ended December 31,
2002    2001    2000

16,753,742 8,261,025 13,496,613
Foreign Currency Translation
Exelixis' subsidiaries located in Germany operate primarily using local
functional currency. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the
period, and revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates for
the period. The resulting translation adjustments are presented as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company has employee and director stock option plans that are more fully
described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company recognizes employee stock-based compensation under the intrinsic value
method of accounting as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25
APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related
interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense is recognized in the
Company financial statements for the stock options granted to employees, which
had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on
the date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and
earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation -
Transition and Disclosure - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 SFAS 148

Pro forma                              $  186 $ 180 $ 244
Since options vest over several years and additional option grants are expected
to be made in future years, the pro forma impact on the results of operations
for the three years ended December 31, 2002 is not representative of the pro
forma effects on the results of operations for future periods.
For grants made in 2002 and 2001, the fair value of each option grant was
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: volatility of 90% and 88%, respectively; 0% dividend yield;
risk-free interest rate of 355% and 416%, respectively; and expected lives of
four years. For grants made in 2000 prior to the initial public offering, the
minimum value method was used with the following assumptions: 0% dividend yield;
risk-free interest rate of 651%; and expected lives of five years. For grants
made in 2000, subsequent to the initial public offering, the fair value of each
option grant was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: volatility of 87%; 0% dividend yield; risk-free
interest rate of 570%; and expected lives of four years. The fair value for
shares purchased pursuant to the ESPP was determined using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 90%, 88% and
87% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; 0% dividend yield; risk-free interest
rate of 199%, 574% and 608% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively; and
expected lives of six months.
The Company accounts for stock options issued to non-employees in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force 96-18,
Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with, Selling Goods or Services EITF 96-18.
Compensation expense for stock options granted to non-employees has been
determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of
the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured and is
periodically re-measured as the underlying options vest.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other
comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss includes
unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains
and losses on cash flow hedges and cumulative translation adjustments.
Comprehensive income loss for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000

NOTE 2 ACQUISITIONS
Genomica Corporation
On November 19, 2001, Exelixis and Genomica Corporation Genomica, a
bio-informatics software company, announced a definitive agreement pursuant to
which Exelixis would acquire Genomica in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at
$1100 million. The transaction was structured as an offer for 100% of
Genomica outstanding common stock to be followed by a merger of Genomica with
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelixis. On December 28, 2001, Exelixis accepted
for payment 22,911,969 shares of Genomica common stock, or 9394% of the total
number of outstanding shares of common stock of Genomica. On January 8, 2002,
the merger of Genomica was completed. Upon effectiveness of the merger,
Genomica became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Exelixis. The transaction, which
was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in 2001, was effected
through the exchange of 028309 of a share of Exelixis common stock for each
outstanding share of Genomica common stock. A total of approximately 69
million shares of Exelixis common stock were issued for all of the outstanding
shares of Genomica common stock.
The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $1100 million,
which consisted of Exelixis common stock valued at $1089 million and estimated
Exelixis transaction costs of $11 million. As of December 31, 2001, Exelixis
had issued only 9394% of the total consideration; accordingly, the Company
recorded the value of the remaining 606%, or $69 million, as a long-term
liability.
The purchase price for Genomica was allocated to the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition, as determined by management based on an independent valuation. As
a result of this transaction, Exelixis recorded net tangible assets of $1062
million including cash and investments of $1096 million, developed technology
of $400,000, which would be amortized over three years, and goodwill of $34
million. At the same time, Exelixis recorded goodwill impairment charge of $27
million, which was expensed in 2001 to operations. The impairment of goodwill
was calculated in accordance with SFAS 121 by estimating the present value of
future cash flows for the ongoing Genomica licensing business using a risk
adjusted discount rate. The goodwill impairment charge represented excess
purchase price that Exelixis viewed as economically equivalent to financing
costs for the acquired cash and investments. Information regarding goodwill is
described in further detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Prior to the December 28, 2001 acquisition date, Exelixis adopted an exit plan
for Genomica. Under this exit plan, the Company terminated Genomica entire
workforce and abandoned its leased facilities in Boulder, Colorado and
Sacramento, California. The estimated costs of the exit plan amounted to $29
million and were included as part of the liabilities assumed in the acquisition.
As of December 31, 2002, the remaining actions to be taken under the exit plan
consisted primarily of residual payments related to the lease obligation for the
facility in Boulder, Colorado, which are expected to continue until the
termination of the lease in 2005, unless the facility is subleased earlier.
The activity impacting the exit plan accrual during the year ended December 31,
2002, including changes in estimates made by management based on available
information, is summarized in the table below in thousands             Balance at        Change in  Assumed   Balance at

In April 2002, Exelixis transferred the Genomica software business to Visualize,
Inc. Visualize for future consideration of up to $24 million in license
fees and royalty payments. Pursuant to the terms of the transaction, Visualize
obtained a license with all rights and obligations to third parties currently
licensing the Genomica software, including the sole right to further develop and
license the software to other third parties. Royalties that Exelixis receives,
if any, will be recorded in the period they are earned as a gain from
discontinued operations. In addition, Visualize assumed the lease obligation
for Genomica abandoned facility in Sacramento, California. Exelixis retains
an internal use license for the software. As a result of this transaction, the
Company reported the operating results of Genomica and the estimated loss on the
sale of Genomica as discontinued operations. For the period beginning January
1, 2002 to Genomica disposal in April 2002, Genomica operating results
consisted of revenues of approximately $58,000 and an operating loss of
approximately $456,000. The loss on the sale of Genomica includes the write-off
of remaining goodwill of approximately $971,000, partially offset by the
reversal of Genomica lease obligation for the Sacramento facility assumed by
Visualize of approximately $176,000.
Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH
In May 2001, the Company acquired a majority of the outstanding capital stock of
Artemis Pharmaceuticals GmbH Artemis, a privately held genetics and
functional genomics company organized under the laws of Germany. The
transaction, which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting,
was effected through the exchange of shares of Exelixis common stock for
Deutschmark 100 of nominal value of Artemis capital stock, using an exchange
ratio of 4064 to one. Approximately 16 million shares of Exelixis common stock
were issued in exchange for 78% of the outstanding capital stock of Artemis held
by Artemis stockholders. In addition, Exelixis received a call option the Call
Option from, and issued a put option the Put Option to, certain
stockholders of Artemis the Option Holders for the issuance of approximately
460,000 shares of Exelixis common stock in exchange for the remaining 22% of the
outstanding capital stock of Artemis held by the Option Holders. Exelixis could
exercise the Call Option at any time from May 14, 2001 through January 31, 2002,
and the Option Holders could exercise their rights under the Put Option at any
time from April 1, 2002 through May 15, 2002. Exelixis exercised the Call
Option for 131,674 shares and 329,591 shares in December 2001 and January 2002,
respectively, which resulted in an increase to goodwill of approximately $19
million and $40 million, respectively. In addition, Exelixis issued fully
vested rights to purchase approximately 187,000 additional shares of Exelixis
common stock to Artemis employees in exchange for such employees' vested options
formerly representing the right to purchase shares of Artemis capital stock
pursuant to the Artemis employee option program.
As of December 31, 2002, the total consideration for the acquisition was
approximately $282 million, which consisted of Exelixis common stock and
options valued at $273 million and estimated Exelixis transaction costs of
$900,000. Exelixis' transaction costs include financial advisory, legal,
accounting and other fees.
The total purchase price, which for financial accounting purposes was valued at
$282 million, was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, as determined
by management based upon an independent valuation. As a result of this
transaction, Exelixis recorded expense associated with the purchase of
in-process research and development of $67 million, net tangible assets of $28
million and intangible assets including goodwill of $187 million, the
majority of which was being amortized over 15 years until December 31, 2001.
The valuation of the purchased in-process research and development of $67
million was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income
approach for each of the three significant in-process projects. The in-process
projects relate primarily to the development of technologies that use vertebrate
genetic model organisms, zebrafish and mice, to identify and functionally
validate novel genes in vivo. These genes can be used as novel screening
targets or as the basis for secreted proteins in clinically and commercially
relevant diseases. The in-process projects have been abandoned or are expected
to be completed over approximately the next two years. The income approach
estimates the value of each acquired in-process project based on its expected
future cash flows. The valuation analysis considered the contribution of the
core technology as well as the percent complete of each in-process research and
development project. The expected present value of the cash flows associated
with the in-process research and development projects was computed using a risk
adjusted rate of return of 30%, which is considered commensurate with the
overall risk and percent complete of the in-process projects. The purchased
in-process research and development was not considered to have reached
technological feasibility, and it has no alternative future use, and
accordingly, it was recorded as a component of operating expense.
The revenues, expenses, cash flows and other assumptions underlying the
estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve
significant risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with
completing the acquired in-process projects include the ability to reach future
research milestones since the technologies being developed are unproven, the
ability to retain key personal, the ability to obtain licenses to key technology
and the ability to avoid infringing on patents and propriety rights of third
parties.
Agritope, Inc.
In December 2000, Exelixis completed its acquisition of Agritope, Inc.
Agritope. As a result of the acquisition, Agritope became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Exelixis, and was subsequently renamed Exelixis Plant Sciences,
Inc. Exelixis Plant Sciences. The transaction, which was accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting, was effected through the exchange of
035 of a share of Exelixis common stock for each outstanding share of Agritope
capital stock. Approximately 17 million shares of Exelixis common stock were
issued in connection with the transaction. In addition, unexpired and
unexercised options and warrants to purchase shares of Agritope capital stock
were assumed by Exelixis pursuant to the transaction and converted into fully
vested options and warrants to purchase approximately 880,000 shares of Exelixis
common stock.
The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $935 million,
which consists of Exelixis common stock, options and warrants valued at $922
million and estimated Exelixis transaction costs of $13 million. Exelixis'
transaction costs include financial advisory, legal, accounting and other fees.
The purchase price for Agritope, which for financial accounting purposes was
valued at $935 million, was allocated to the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition, as determined by an independent valuation. As a result of this
transaction, Exelixis recorded expense associated with the purchase of
in-process research and development of $381 million, net tangible liabilities
of $36 million and intangible assets including goodwill of $589 million, the
majority of which was being amortized over 15 years until December 31, 2001.
The valuation of the purchased in-process research and development of $381
million was based upon the results of an independent valuation using the income
approach for each of the ten projects in process. The in-process projects
relate primarily to the development of disease and insect resistant fruits and
vegetables and have been abandoned or are expected to be completed over
approximately the next three and one-half years. The income approach estimates
the value of each acquired in-process project based on its expected future cash
flows. The valuation analysis considered the contribution of the core technology
as well as the percent complete of each in-process research and development
project. The expected present value of the cash flows associated with the
in-process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted
rate of return of 35%, which is considered commensurate with the overall risk
and percent complete of the in-process projects. The purchased technology was
not considered to have reached technological feasibility, and it has no
alternative future use, and accordingly, it was recorded as a component
operating expense.
The revenues, expenses, cash flows and other assumptions underlying the
estimated fair value of the acquired in-process research and development involve
significant risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties associated with
completing the acquired in-process projects include obtaining the necessary
regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and
profitably produce, distribute and sell products.
The Company acquired Vinifera, Inc. Vinifera in connection with the purchase
of Agritope the parent company of Vinifera in 2000. Vinifera was organized as
a majority-owned subsidiary and was engaged in the grape vine propagation
business. On the date of acquisition, Exelixis committed to a plan to sell the
Vinifera operations because this business did not fit with the strategic
objectives of the Company. On March 31, 2001, the Company reduced its ownership
interest in Vinifera from 57% to 19% by selling 30 million shares of Vinifera
common stock back to Vinifera in consideration for $21 million in interest
bearing promissory notes. As a result of the sale of Vinifera common stock back
to Vinifera, Exelixis deconsolidated Vinifera, excluded its share of Vinifera
operating losses for the first quarter of 2001 of $275,000 and recorded the
following amounts as an adjustment to goodwill recorded in connection with the
acquisition of Agritope: a write-down of the value of acquired developed
technology attributable to Vinifera of $435,000, a gain on sale of Vinifera
shares of $590,000 and a promissory note reserve of $1,700,000. The net
adjustment was an increase to goodwill in the amount of $675,000. Beginning
April 1, 2001, the Company accounted for its remaining investment in Vinifera
using the cost method.
As of December 31, 2001, the Company reserved for 100% of these promissory notes
due to risks associated with collection. Due to a significant decline in the
operating performance of Vinifera, in December 2001, the Company wrote down its
remaining cost-basis investment in Vinifera to zero. Vinifera ceased operations
in 2002.
In connection with the Agritope acquisition, Exelixis also acquired interests in
Agrinomics LLC Agrinomics, which is a 50% owned subsidiary that conducts a
gene discovery program, and Superior Tomato Associates, LLC Superior Tomato,
which was a 66-2/3% owned subsidiary formed to develop and market longer-lasting
tomatoes. The Company dissolved Superior Tomato during 2001, which resulted in
no material impact to its financial results. Agrinomics continues in existence.
Pro Forma Results
The Company audited historical statements of operations include the results of
Genomica, Artemis and Agritope subsequent to the acquisition dates of December

Bayer
In May 1998, the Company entered into a six-year research collaboration
agreement with Bayer AG including its affiliates, Bayer to identify novel
screening targets for the development of new pesticides for use in crop
protection. The Company provided research services directed towards identifying
and investigating molecular targets in insects and nematodes that may be useful
in developing and commercializing pesticide products. The Company received a
$12 million license fee upon execution of the agreement that was deferred and
will be recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.
In December 1999, the Company significantly expanded its relationship with Bayer
by forming a joint venture in the form of a new limited liability company,
Genoptera LLC Genoptera. Under the terms of the Genoptera operating
agreement, Bayer provides 100% of the capital necessary to fund the operations
of Genoptera and has the ability to control the entity with a 60% ownership
interest. The Company owns the other 40% interest in Genoptera without making
any capital contribution and reports its investment in Genoptera using the
equity method of accounting. Bayer initial capital contributions to Genoptera
were $100 million in January 2000 and another $100 million in January 2001.
Bayer is required to also contribute cash to Genoptera in amounts necessary to
fund its ongoing operating expenses. Genoptera has incurred losses since
inception. Since the carrying value of this investment is zero and there is no
obligation to fund future losses, Exelixis has not recorded equity method losses
to date for Genoptera.
In January 2000, the Company, Bayer and Genoptera entered into an exclusive
eight-year research collaboration agreement, which superceded the 1998 agreement
discussed above. The Company is required to provide Genoptera with expanded
research services focused on developing insecticides and nematicides for crop
protection. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Genoptera paid the
Company a $100 million license fee and a $100 million research commitment fee.
One-half of these fees were received in January 2000, and the remaining amounts
were received in January 2001. Additionally, Genoptera is required to pay the
Company approximately $100 million in annual research funding. The Company can
earn additional payments under the collaboration agreement upon the achievement
of certain milestones. The Company can also earn royalties on the future sale by
Bayer of pesticide products incorporating compounds developed against targets
and assays under the agreement. The agreement also provides Bayer an exclusive
royalty-free option to use certain technology developed under the agreement in
the development of fungicides and herbicides. To the extent permitted under the
collaboration agreement, if the Company were to develop and sell certain human
health or agrochemical products that incorporate compounds developed under the
agreement, it would be obligated to pay royalties to Genoptera. No such
activities are expected for the foreseeable future.
Bristol-Myers Squibb
In September 1999, the Company entered into a three-year research and technology
transfer agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Bristol-Myers Squibb or
BMS to identify the mechanism of action MOA of compounds delivered to the
Company by BMS. In July 2002, the agreement was extended for an additional two
years. BMS agreed to pay the Company a $250,000 technology access fee, which is
being recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement. Under the terms of
the agreement, the Company is entitled to receive research funding ranging from
$13 million in the first year up to as much as $25 million annually in future
years. The Company can also earn additional amounts under the agreement upon
the achievement of certain milestones as well as earn royalties on the future
sale by BMS of human products incorporating compounds developed under the
agreement. The agreement also includes technology transfer and licensing terms,
which call for BMS and the Company to license and share certain core
technologies in genomics and lead optimization.
In July 2001, the Company and BMS entered into a collaboration involving three
agreements: a a Stock Purchase Agreement; b a Cancer Collaboration
Agreement; and c a License Agreement. Under the terms of the collaboration,
BMS i purchased 600,600 shares of Exelixis common stock in a private placement
at a purchase price of $3330 per share, for cash proceeds to Exelixis of
approximately $200 million; ii agreed to pay Exelixis a $50 million upfront
license fee and provide Exelixis with $30 million per year in research funding
for a minimum of three years; and iii granted to Exelixis a worldwide,
fully-paid, exclusive license to an analogue to Rebeccamycin developed by BMS,
which is currently in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for cancer. Due to
risk and uncertainties with Rebeccamycin, and because the analogue had not
reached technological feasibility and has no alternative use, the analogue was
assigned no value for financial reporting purposes. Exelixis has agreed to
provide BMS with exclusive rights to certain potential small molecule compound
drug targets in cancer identified during the term of the research collaboration.
The premium in excess of fair market value of $100 million paid for the common
stock purchased by BMS is being accounted for similar to an upfront license fee
and is being recognized ratably over the life of the contract.
SmithKlineBeecham Corporation
In October 2002, Exelixis and SmithKlineBeecham Corporation GSK established
a collaboration to discover and develop novel therapeutics in the areas of
vascular biology, inflammatory disease and oncology. The collaboration involved
three agreements: a a Product Development and Commercialization Agreement; b
a Stock Purchase and Stock Issuance Agreement; and c a Loan and Security
Agreement. Under the terms of the Product Development and Commercialization
Agreement, GSK has paid the Company $300 million in an upfront fee and $100
million in annual research funding, and has agreed to pay a minimum of an
additional $800 million in research and development funding over the first six
years of the collaboration.
Under the terms of the Stock Purchase and Stock Issuance Agreement, GSK
purchased two million shares of Exelixis' common stock in a private placement at
a purchase price of $700 per share, which represented a premium of
approximately 100% to the stock price on the effective date of the agreements.
The Company received cash proceeds of approximately $140 million for the
purchase of these shares. Exelixis has the option to sell additional common
shares to GSK in the future.
Under the Loan and Security Agreement, GSK provided a loan facility of up to
$850 million for use in the Company efforts under the collaboration, and the
Company borrowed $250 million under that agreement in December 2002. All loan
amounts bear interest at a rate of 4% per annum and are secured by the
intellectual property, technology and equipment created or utilized pursuant to
the collaboration. Principal and accrued interest become due in installments,
beginning on or about the sixth anniversary of the collaboration, unless the
collaboration is earlier terminated by GSK. Repayment of all or any of the
amounts advanced to the Company under this agreement may, at the Company
election, be in the form of Exelixis' common stock, subject to certain
conditions.
The upfront fee and the premium portion of the equity purchase have been
deferred and will be recognized as revenue over the development term. Exelixis
may also receive clinical and developmental payments based on the number and
timing of compounds reaching specified milestones. Based on the continued
successful development of these compounds, these payments could range from
$2190 million to $3690 million, through the compounds' commercialization. Two
years from the start of the collaboration, GSK and Exelixis may elect to expand
the collaboration, and under this option, Exelixis' milestone payments could
double, and the development funding and the loan facility would also be
significantly expanded.
Dow AgroSciences
In July 2000, the Company entered into a three-year research collaboration with
Dow AgroSciences LLC Dow AgroSciences to identify the MOA of herbicides and
fungicides delivered to it under this agreement. The identity and function of
these compounds are not known to the Company prior to their delivery.
Under this agreement, the Company receives access to a collection of proprietary
compounds from Dow AgroSciences that may be useful in the Company human
therapeutic drug discovery programs.
The Company is required to identify and validate targets and format assays to be
used by Dow AgroSciences to develop new classes of fungicides and herbicides.
Dow AgroSciences will pay the Company research support fees, milestone payments
and royalties based on achievements in the research and commercialization of any
resultant new products.
Protein Design Labs
On May 22, 2001, the Company and Protein Design Labs, Inc. PDL entered into
a collaboration to discover and develop humanized antibodies for the diagnosis,
prevention and treatment of cancer. The collaboration will utilize Exelixis'
model organism genetics technology for the identification of new cancer drug
targets and PDL antibody and clinical development expertise to create and
develop new antibody drug candidates. PDL is required to provide Exelixis with
$40 million in annual research funding until June 2003 and has purchased a
$300 million convertible note. The note bears interest at 575%, and the
interest thereon is payable annually. The note is convertible at PDL option
any time after the first anniversary of the note issuance. The note is
convertible into Exelixis common stock at a conversion price per share equal to
the lower of i $28175 or ii 110% of the Fair Market Value as defined in
the note of a share of Exelixis common stock at the time of conversion.
Agrinomics
In July 1999, Agritope and Aventis CropScience USA. LP Aventis CropScience,
now Bayer CropScience LP, Bayer CropScience formed Agrinomics LLC to conduct
a research, development and commercialization program in the field of
agricultural functional genomics. As a result of the Company acquisition of
Agritope, the Company owns a 50% interest in Agrinomics, while Bayer CropScience
owns the remaining 50% interest. Bayer CropScience has agreed to make capital
contributions to Agrinomics in cash totaling $200 million over a five-year
period, of which $30 million and $40 million were contributed in 2002 and
2000, respectively. There were no capital contributions made by Bayer
CropScience to Agrinomics in 2001. Agritope contributed certain technology and
a collection of seeds generated using such technology. In connection with the
Company acquisition of Agritope, no portion of the purchase price was assigned
to Agrinomics. Although the Company is required to account for its investment
in Agrinomics under the equity method, the Company does not expect to include in
its consolidated financial statements its proportionate share of the losses of
Agrinomics until such time, if ever, that the Company makes a capital
contribution to Agrinomics. There is no requirement for the Company to make
capital contributions to Agrinomics.
In December 2002, Agrinomics established an alliance to enhance seed oil content
in commercially valuable crops with Renessen LLC. Renessen is a joint venture
between Monsanto Company and Cargill, Inc. The collaboration combines
Agrinomics' technological leadership in agricultural functional genomics,
high-throughput gene screening and seed trait identification, developed at
Exelixis Plant Sciences, with Renessen global expertise in quality trait crop
development and commercialization, with the goal of accelerating the development
of novel proprietary crops with improved seed composition traits. This
collaboration leverages the unique capabilities of Agrinomics' powerful ACTTAG
gene activation and selection platform to rapidly discover and validate genes
that can optimize important seed traits in order to increase the commercial
value of many of the world most significant agricultural crops. Under the
terms of the collaboration, Renessen will provide Agrinomics with committed
annual research funding ranging from $13 million in the first year up to as
much as $20 million annually in future years, in addition to payments for the
selection of genes and other product options. Agrinomics can also earn
additional amounts under the agreement upon the achievement of certain
milestones, as well as royalties on commercialized products that may emerge from
the collaboration. In addition, Renessen will contribute research and product
development capabilities in taking gene candidates identified by Agrinomics into
crop products that include leading commercial germplasm.
Pharmacia
In February 1999, the Company entered into a research collaboration agreement
with Pharmacia Corporation Pharmacia focused on the identification of novel
targets that may be useful in the development of pharmaceutical products in the
areas of Alzheimer disease and metabolic syndrome. Pharmacia agreed to pay the
Company a $50 million non-refundable license fee, which was being recognized as
revenue over the term of the agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, as
expanded and amended in October 1999, the Company also received an obligation
from Pharmacia to provide future research funding. In July 2001, the Company
announced the reacquisition, effective February 2002, of future rights to the
research programs. Pharmacia retained rights to targets under the existing
agreement selected prior to the reacquisition date, subject to the payment of
milestones for certain of those targets selected and royalties for future
development of products against or using those targets. Pharmacia will have no
other obligations to make payments to the Company, including approximately $90
million in annual funding that would have otherwise been payable for an
additional two years if the Company had not elected to reacquire rights to the
research. As a result of this transaction, revenue recognition of upfront
license fees and milestone payments was accelerated over the remaining term of
the agreement.
In connection with entering into the February 1999 agreement, Pharmacia also
purchased 1,875,000 shares of Exelixis Series D preferred stock at $300 per
share, resulting in net cash proceeds to the Company of $75 million. Further,
Pharmacia loaned the Company $75 million in exchange for a non-interest bearing
convertible promissory note. The convertible promissory note was converted into
an aggregate of 480,769 shares of common stock of the Company in July 2000.
Compound Collaborations
The Company entered into collaboration agreements with Cytokinetics, Inc., Elan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Schering-Plough Research Institute, Inc. and Scios Inc.
in 2001 and Merck & Co., Inc. in 2002, to jointly design custom high-throughput
screening compound libraries that Exelixis will synthesize and qualify. Each
company is required to pay Exelixis a per-compound fee and has paid an upfront
technology access fee that is creditable towards the future purchase of
compounds. The upfront fees are initially deferred. Revenues under these
collaboration agreements will generally be recognized upon delivery of the
accepted compounds. Each party retains the rights to use the compounds in its
own unique drug discovery programs and in its collaborative efforts with third
parties.
NOTE 4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company had outstanding loans aggregating $904,000 and $937,000 to certain
officers and employees at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The notes
are general recourse or collateralized by certain real property assets, bear
interest at rates ranging from 46% to 70% and have maturities through 2006.
The principal plus accrued interest will be forgiven at various rates over three
to four years from the employees' date of employment with Exelixis. If an
employee leaves Exelixis, all unpaid and unforgiven principal and interest will
be due and payable within 60 days.
As of December 31, 2002, the Company also had outstanding loans aggregating $12
million to its stockholders. The loans were issued to enable certain
non-officer employees to purchase stock pursuant to their employee stock
options. The loans bear interest at rates ranging from 613% to 650% and
mature at various times through February 2004.
For the years ended, December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized
revenues of $136 million, $131 million and $132 million, respectively, under
a collaboration agreement with Bayer through the Company joint venture with
Genoptera.
For the years ended, December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized revenues
of $38 million and $237,000, respectively, under a collaboration agreement with
Aventis CropScience through the Company joint venture with Agrinomics. During
2002, Bayer completed the acquisition of Aventis S.A., including Aventis
CropScience. As a result, Bayer assumed Aventis' 50% ownership of Agrinomics.
The Company recognized revenues of $38 million under the Agrinomics joint
venture for the year ended, December 31, 2002.

NOTE 6 GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES
On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142, which addresses the financial accounting and
reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their
acquisition. This accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be
amortized, and instead, be tested for impairment on a periodic basis.
In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company discontinued the amortization of
goodwill effective January 1, 2002. In addition, the Company re-characterized
any unamortized acquired assembled workforce as goodwill because it is no longer
defined as an acquired intangible asset under SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations. Accordingly, no goodwill or acquired workforce amortization was
recognized during the year ended December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS 142
also required the completion of a transitional impairment test within 12 months
of adoption, with any impairment treated as a cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company completed
the transitional impairment test, which did not result in impairment of recorded
goodwill.
The Company adopted an annual goodwill impairment test date as of the beginning
of the fourth quarter of 2002.  Following this approach, the Company will
monitor asset-carrying values as of October 1, assess if there is a potential
impairment and complete the measurement of impairment, if required. The Company
will perform the impairment measurement procedures under SFAS 142 if it
determines that a potential impairment of goodwill exists.
The Company completed the annual impairment test as of October 1, 2002, which
did not result in impairment of recorded goodwill.

NOTE 7 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In November 2002, the Company implemented a restructuring plan. This
restructuring plan was designed to facilitate the Company evolution into a
fully integrated drug discovery company by reallocating resources to permit
greater focus on building the Company expanding portfolio of development
programs. The restructuring resulted in a reduction in workforce of 40
employees, primarily from the Company U.S. research operations. Accordingly,
the Company has recorded a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of
$708,000, consisting primarily of involuntary termination benefits. As of
December 31, 2002, substantially all amounts under the restructuring have been

NOTE 8 DEBT
Under the Loan and Security Agreement executed in connection with the GSK
collaboration, GSK provided a loan facility of up to $850 million for use in
the Company efforts under the collaboration. The Company borrowed $250
million under that agreement in December 2002. All loan amounts bear interest at
a rate of 4% per annum and are secured by the intellectual property, technology
and equipment created or utilized pursuant to the collaboration. Principal and
accrued interest become due in installments, beginning on or about the sixth
anniversary of the collaboration, unless the collaboration is earlier terminated
by GSK. Repayment of all or any of the amounts advanced to the Company under
this agreement may, at the Company election, be in the form of Exelixis'
common stock, subject to certain conditions.
In May 2002, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank
for an equipment line of credit of up to $160 million with a drawdown period of
one year. Each draw on the line of credit has a payment term of 48 months and
bears interest at the bank published prime rate 425% at December 31, 2002.
At December 31, 2002, approximately $51 million was outstanding under the line
of credit, and $109 million remained available on the line of credit. Pursuant
to the terms of the line of credit, the Company is required to maintain a first
priority security interest in the form of a deposit or securities account at the
bank equal to 110% of the outstanding obligation under the line of credit. This
collateral account is managed in accordance with the Company investment policy
and is restricted as to withdrawal. As of December 31, 2002, the collateral
account had a cash balance of approximately $58 million, and the Company
recorded this amount in the balance sheet as restricted cash.

NOTE 9 COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS
Initial Public Offering
On April 14, 2000, the Company completed an initial public offering in which it
sold 9,100,000 shares of common stock at $1300 per share for net cash proceeds
of approximately $1080 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and
other offering costs. Upon the closing of the offering, all the Company
mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into 22,877,656
shares of common stock. After the offering, the Company authorized capital
consisted of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, $0001 par value, and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0001 par value. On May 1, 2000, the
underwriters exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional
1,365,000 shares, resulting in net cash proceeds of approximately $165 million.
Stock Repurchase Agreements
Under the terms of the Company stock option plans, options are exercisable
when granted, and, if exercised, the related shares are subject to repurchase
upon termination of employment. Repurchase rights lapse over the vesting
periods, which are generally four years. Should the employment of the holders of
common stock subject to repurchase terminate prior to full vesting of the
outstanding shares, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares at a price
per share equal to the original exercise price. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
378,471 and 1,253,226 shares, respectively, were subject to such repurchase
terms.
Warrants
Historically, the Company has granted warrants to purchase shares of capital
stock to certain preferred stockholders and third parties in connection with
financing and operating lease arrangements. In addition, in connection with the
Agritope acquisition refer to Note 2, the Company assumed warrants to purchase
239,167 shares of Company common stock. All of the Agritope warrants expired
unexercised on December 31, 2001.
At December 31, 2002, the following warrants to purchase common stock were
outstanding and exercisable  Number  Exercise Price     Date      Expiration

78,750 $     1300   April 1, 2000   April 14, 2005
-  257,053 The Company determines the fair value of warrants issued using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. Prior to 1999, the fair value of warrants issued was not
material, and accordingly, no value has been ascribed to them for financial
reporting purposes.
The Company determined the fair value of the warrants issued during 1999,
related to a building lease, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: expected life of five years; a weighted average
risk-free interest rate of 61%; expected dividend yield of zero; volatility of
70%; and a deemed value of the common stock of $571 per share. The fair value
of the warrants of $391,000 has been capitalized and is being amortized as rent
expense over the term of the lease.
The Company determined the fair value of the warrants issued during 2000,
related to a building lease, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using
the following assumptions: expected life of five years; a weighted average
risk-free interest rate of 638%; expected dividend yield of zero; volatility of
70%; and a deemed value of the common stock of $1100 per share. The fair value
of the warrants of $518,000 has been capitalized and is being amortized as rent
expense over the term of the lease.
Reserved Shares
At December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 191 million shares of
common stock reserved for future issuance related to its stock plans, 401k
plan, convertible note and loan and the exercise of outstanding warrants.
NOTE 10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Stock Based Benefit Plans
Stock Option Plans. In January 1995, the Company adopted the 1994 Employee,
Director and Consultant Stock Option Plan 1994 Plan. The 1994 Plan provides
for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options and
stock purchase rights to key employees, directors, consultants and members of
the Scientific Advisory Board SAB. In September 1997, the Company adopted
the 1997 Equity Incentive Plan 1997 Plan. The 1997 Plan amends and
supercedes the 1994 Plan. In January 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Equity
Incentive Plan 2000 Plan to replace the 1997 Plan. A total of 3,000,000
shares of Exelixis common stock were initially authorized for issuance under the
2000 Plan. On the last day of each year for ten years, starting in 2000, the
share reserve will automatically be increased by a number of shares equal to the
greater of: 5% of the Company outstanding shares on a fully-diluted basis; or
that number of shares subject to stock awards granted under the 2000 Plan during
the prior 12-month period.
The Board of Directors or a designated Committee of the Board is responsible for
administration of the Company employee stock option plans and determines the
term, exercise price and vesting terms of each option. Incentive stock options
may be granted at an exercise price per share at least equal to the estimated
fair value per underlying common share on the date of grant not less than 110%
of the estimated fair value in the case of holders of more than 10% of the
Company voting stock. Options granted under the 1997 and 2000 Plans are
exercisable when granted and generally expire ten years from the date of grant
five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of
the Company voting stock.
In January 2000, the Company adopted the 2000 Non-Employees Directors' Stock
Option Plan Director Plan. The Director Plan provides for the automatic
grant of options to purchase shares of common stock to non-employee directors. A
total of 500,000 shares of the Company common stock were initially authorized
for issuance under the Director Plan. On the last day of each year for ten
years, starting in 2000, the share reserve will automatically be increased by a
number of shares equal to the greater of: 075% of the Company outstanding
shares on a fully-diluted basis; or that number of shares subject to options
granted under the Director Plan during the prior 12-month period. Each person
who is a non-employee director will automatically receive an initial grant for
25,000 shares. The initial grant is exercisable immediately but will vest at the
rate of 25% of the shares on the first anniversary of the grant date and monthly
thereafter over the next three years. In addition, on the day after each annual
meeting of the Exelixis stockholders, each non-employee director will
automatically receive an annual grant for 5,000 shares. This annual grant is
exercisable immediately but will vest monthly over the following year.
In connection with the acquisition of Agritope in December 2000, the Company
assumed all the options granted and outstanding to consultants and employees
under the Agritope, Inc. 1997 Stock Award Plan. Each outstanding Agritope stock
option was converted into the right to purchase the number of shares of the
Company common stock as determined using the applicable exchange ratio of 035
refer to Note 2. All other terms and conditions of the Agritope stock options
did not change and such options will operate in accordance with their terms.
During April 2001, Exelixis granted approximately 545,000 supplemental stock
options Supplemental Options under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan to certain
employees excluding officers and directors who had stock options with exercise
prices greater than $1600 per share under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan. The
number of Supplemental Options granted was equal to 50% of the corresponding
original grant held by each employee. The Supplemental Options have an exercise
price of $1600, vest monthly over a two-year period beginning April 1, 2001 and
have a 27-month term. The vesting on the corresponding original stock options
was halted and will resume in April 2003 following the completion of vesting of
the Supplemental Options. This new grant constitutes a synthetic repricing as
defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation Number FIN
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, and will
result in certain options being reported using the variable plan method of
accounting for stock compensation expense until they are exercised, forfeited or
expire. For the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the cumulative
compensation expense recorded for the Supplemental Options was approximately
$242,000 and $246,000, respectively.

per share fair value for shares purchased pursuant to the ESPP during 2002, 2001
and 2000 was $445, $660 and $508, respectively. A total of 300,000 shares of
common stock were initially authorized for issuance under the ESPP. On the last
day of each year for ten years, starting in 2000, the share reserve will

NOTE 11 INCOME TAXES
The Company has incurred net losses since inception and, consequently, has not
recorded any U.S. federal or state income taxes. The Company has recorded a tax
provision of approximately $345,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 related
to income earned in its foreign operations.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had federal and California net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $766 million and $367 million, respectively,
which expire at various dates beginning in the year 2003. The Company also had
federal and California research and development credit carryforwards of
approximately $108 million in each jurisdiction, which expire at various dates
beginning in the year 2010.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial changes in the Company
ownership could result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating
loss carryforwards that can be utilized in future years to offset future taxable
income. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating
losses and credits before utilization.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of net operating
loss and credit carryforwards and of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used
for income tax purposes.
The Company deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following in
thousands                                   December 31,

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any,
the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax
assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance
increased by $691 million, $89 million and $278 million during 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.
