A.
Organization and Basis of Presentation The Boston Beer Company, Inc. and subsidiaries the
Company are engaged in the business of selling low
alcoholic beverages throughout the United States and in selected
international markets, under the trade names The Boston
Beer Company, Twisted Tea Brewing Company and
HardCore Cider Company. The Companys Samuel
Adams
beers and Sam Adams
Light
are produced and sold under the trade name, The Boston Beer
Company.   
B.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year The Companys fiscal year is a fifty-two or fifty-three
week period ending on the last Saturday in December. The fiscal
period of 2005 consists of fifty-three weeks and the fiscal
periods of 2004 and 2003 consist of fifty-two weeks. Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are
wholly-owned. All intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain amounts in the accompanying 2004 financial statements
have been reclassified to permit comparison with the 2005
presentation. Specifically, the Company has reclassified the
cash flows of activities of its trading securities from cash
flows from investing activities to cash flows from operating
activities. The net impact was to increase cash flows from
investing activities and decrease cash flows from operating
activities by $240million in 2004. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004 included cash on-hand, as well as
tax-exempt and taxable money market instruments that are highly
liquid investments. Short-Term Investments The Company classifies its investments depending on the
Companys intent and the nature of the investment. The
Companys short-term investments at the end of
December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 consist of
trading securities, which are recorded at fair market value, and
whose change in fair market value is included in earnings.
Short-term investments at December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004 consisted of municipal auction rate
securities. In 2003 and a portion of 2004, the Company held
available-for-sale securities which were recorded at fair market
value, with the change in fair market value 38 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued during the period excluded from earnings and recorded, net of
tax, as a component of other comprehensive loss. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts that is
based on historical trends, customer knowledge, any known
disputes, and the aging of the accounts receivable balances
combined with managements estimate of future potential
recoverability, based upon managements knowledge of
customers financial condition. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work in process and
finished goods. Raw materials, which principally consists of
hops, bottles and packaging, are stated at the lower of cost,
determined on the
first-in, first-out
basis, or market. The cost elements of work in process and
finished goods inventory consist of raw materials, direct labor
and manufacturing overhead. Packaging design costs are expensed
as incurred. The provisions for excess or expired inventory are based on
managements estimates of forecasted usage of inventories.
A significant change in the timing or level of demand for
certain products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in
recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory
in the future. Provisions for excess inventory are recorded as
cost of goods sold. The computation of the excess hops inventory requires management
to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth,
product mix, cancellation costs, and supply, among others. The
Company manages inventory levels and purchase commitments in an
effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under
commitment. The Companys accounting policy for hops
inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by
establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and
commitments exceed forecasted needs as determined by the
Companys brewmasters. The Company has not recorded any
loss on purchase commitments in the years ended
December31, 2005, December25, 2004 and
December27, 2003. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Major
renewals and betterments that extend the life of the property
are capitalized. Some of the Companys equipment is used by
other brewing companies to produce the Companys products
under contract see NoteI. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives
of the underlying assets as follows   
Kegs
5years   
Machinery and plant equipment
3 to 20years, or the term of the production agreement,
whichever is shorter   
Office equipment and furniture
3 to 5years   
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of the remaining term of the lease or estimated useful
life of the asset   
Building
15 to 20years Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the
Company-owned Cincinnati Brewery over the fair value of the net
assets acquired upon the completion of the acquisition in
November 2000 and relates to the Companys single operating
unit. The Company does not amortize goodwill, but performs an
annual impairment analysis of goodwill by comparing the carrying
value and the fair value of its one reporting 39 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued unit at the end of the third quarter of every fiscal year. The
Company has concluded that its goodwill was not impaired as of
December31, 2005 and December25, 2004. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are recorded at cost. The Company evaluates
potential impairment of long-lived assets on a periodic basis.
If indicators of impairment are present with respect to
long-lived assets used in operations and undiscounted future
cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the
assets carrying amount, an impairment loss representing
the excess of the fair value of the asset over its carrying
value would be charged to expense in the period the impairment
is identified. Income Taxes The Company provides for deferred taxes using an asset and
liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences
of events that have been recognized in the Companys
consolidated financial statements or tax returns, which result
in differences between the book and tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities and carryforwards, such as
tax credits and loss carryforwards. In estimating future tax
consequences, all expected future events, other than enactment
of changes in the tax laws or rates, are generally considered.
Valuation allowances are provided to the extent deemed necessary
when realization of deferred tax assets appears unlikely. The Company records estimated income tax reserves as it deems
necessary in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No5, Accounting for Contingencies. The
Company includes its reserves for probable and estimated income
tax exposures in accrued expenses see NoteH. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on product sales at the time when
the product is shipped and the following conditions exist:
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, title has passed
to the customer according to the shipping terms, the price is
fixed and determinable, and collection of the sales proceeds is
reasonably assured. Further, the Company generally accepts and
destroys beer that has passed its expiration date for freshness
and is returned by distributors. Credits given to distributors
for these returns represent approximately fifty percent of the
distributors cost of the beer. Consequently, the Company
records an allowance for estimated returns, based on historical
experience and current trends. Cost of Goods Sold The following expenses are included in cost of goods sold: raw
material costs, packaging costs, costs related to deposit
activity, purchasing and receiving costs, manufacturing labor
and overhead, brewing and processing costs, inspection costs
relating to quality control, inbound freight charges,
depreciation expense related to manufacturing equipment and
warehousing costs, which include rent, labor and overhead costs. Shipping Costs Costs incurred for the shipping of products to customers are
included in advertising, promotional and selling expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company
incurred shipping costs of $172million 137million and $125million in fiscal years 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Advertising and Sales Promotions The following expenses are included in advertising, promotional
and selling expenses: media advertising costs, sales and
marketing expenses, salary and benefit expenses, promotional
activity expenses, freight 40 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued charges related to shipments of finished goods from
manufacturing locations to distributor locations, and point of
sale items. The Company reimburses its wholesalers and retailers for
promotional discounts, samples and certain advertising and
promotional activities used in the promotion of the
Companys products. The reimbursements for discounts to
wholesalers are recorded as reductions to net revenue.
Reimbursements from wholesalers for certain advertising and
promotional activities are recorded as reductions to
advertising, promotional and selling expenses. The Company also enters into sales incentive arrangements with
its wholesalers based upon performance of certain marketing and
advertising activities by the wholesalers. Depending on
applicable state laws and regulations, these activities
promoting the Companys products may include, but are not
limited to, the following:
point-of-sale
merchandise placement and product displays in retailer
locations, and promotional programs at retail locations. The
costs incurred for these sales incentive arrangements and
promotional activities are included in advertising, promotional
and selling expenses. The costs associated with advertising and
sales promotional programs are charged to expense during the
period in which they are incurred. Total advertising and sales
promotional expenditures of $557million 565million and $554million were included in
advertising, promotional and selling expenses in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income for fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Of these amounts 42million, $44million and $46million
related to sales incentives, samples and other promotional
discounts, and $263million, $277million and
$279million related to advertising costs for fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses The following expenses are included in general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income: general and administrative salary and
benefit expenses, insurance costs, professional service fees,
rent and utility expenses, meals, travel and entertainment
expenses for general and administrative employees, and other
general and administrative overhead costs. Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
equivalents, short-term investments, and trade receivables. The
Company places its short-term investments with high credit
quality financial institutions. The Company sells primarily to
independent beer distributors across the United States. Sales to
foreign customers are insignificant. Receivables arising from
these sales are not collateralized; however, credit risk is
minimized as a result of the large and diverse nature of the
Companys customer base. The Company establishes an
allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding
the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends and
other information. There were no individual customer accounts
receivable balances outstanding at December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004 that were in excess of 10% of the gross
accounts receivable balance on those dates. No individual
customers represented more than 10% of the Companys net
revenues during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003. The Company uses specific hops for its beer. These hops include

specific regions in Germany. To a lesser extent, the Company
uses traditional English hops from England. HHA hops comprised
68%, 69%, and 61% of the Companys hop purchases in fiscal
years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. TTE hops comprised 22 19%, and 8% of the Companys hop purchases in fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company maintains over
one years supply of essential hop varieties on-hand in
order to limit the risk of an unexpected reduction in supply and
stores its hops in multiple cold storage warehouses 41 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued to minimize the impact of a catastrophe at a single site.
Further, the Company believes there are alternate sources of hop
crops available in case of crop failure or a catastrophic event. Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments The Companys primary financial instruments at
December31, 2005 and December25, 2004 consisted of
cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable
and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these financial
instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term
nature of these instruments. Stock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based awards using the
intrinsic-value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and related interpretations. The
Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock-based
awards with graded vesting under APB Opinion No25 using
the straight-line attribution method. The following table illustrates the effect on net income and net
income per share if the Company had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting

STATEMENTSContinued Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by
the weighted-average common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average common shares and potentially dilutive
securities outstanding using the treasury stock method during
the period. Segment Reporting The Company consists of a single operating segment that produces
and sells low alcoholic beverages. The Companys brands,
which include Samuel
Adams,
Sam Adams
Light,
Twisted
Tea
and
HardCore,
are predominantly malt beverages, which are sold to the same
types of customers in similar size quantities, at similar price
points and through substantially the same channels of
distribution. The Companys products are manufactured using
similar production processes and have comparable alcohol content
and constitute a single group of similar products. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued SFASNo151, Inventory
Costs, an Amendment of ARB No43, Chapter4.
SFASNo151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
should be recognized as current period charges in all
circumstances. The Company is required to adopt
SFASNo151 on January1, 2006 and does not
believe the adoption of SFASNo151 will have a
material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123R which
is a revision of SFASNo123. SFASNo123R
addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company
receives employee services in exchange for aequity
instruments of the company or bliabilities that are
based on the fair value of the companys equity instruments
or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity
instruments and generally requires that such transactions be
accounted for using a fair-value-based method. As permitted by the current SFASNo123, the Company
has accounted for share-based compensation to employees using
the intrinsic value method of APB Opinion No25 and, as
such, it generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee
stock awards. The Securities and Exchange Commission the
SEC amended the effective date of
SFASNo123R and the Company is now required to adopt
SFASNo123R on January1, 2006. As permitted
under SFASNo123R, the Company will adopt the
provisions of the statement using the modified-prospective
transition method, which requires recognition of compensation
costs in financial statements issued subsequent to the date of
adoption for all share-based payments granted, modified, or
settled after the date of adoption as well as for any awards
that were granted prior to the adoption date for which the
requisite service has not been provided as of the adoption date.
Prior period financial statements are not restated under the
modified-prospective transition method. Based on stock awards
outstanding as of December31, 2005, the Company estimates
stock-based compensation expense, net of tax effect, to be in
the range of $05million to $11million for fiscal
year 2006, depending upon the assumed vesting of certain
performance based options. 43 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Long-term Debt and Line of Credit The Company has a credit facility in place that provides for a
$200million revolving line of credit which expires on
March31, 2007. The Company may elect an interest rate for
borrowings under the credit facility based on either
ithe Alternative Prime Rate 725% at December31,
2005 or iithe applicable LIBOR rate 446% at
December31, 2005 plus 045%. The Company incurs an annual
commitment fee of 015% on the unused portion of the facility
and is obligated to meet certain financial covenants, including
the maintenance of specified levels of tangible net worth and
net income. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as
of December31, 2005. There were no borrowings outstanding
under the Companys credit facility as of December31,
2005 and December25, 2004. There are also certain restrictive covenants set forth by the
debt agreement. Pursuant to the negative covenants, the Company
has agreed that it will not: enter into any indebtedness or
guarantees other than those specified by the lender, enter into
any sale and leaseback transactions, merge, consolidate, or
dispose of significant assets without the lenders prior
written consent, will not make or maintain any investments other
than those permitted in the debt agreement, will not enter into
any transactions with affiliates outside of the ordinary course
of business, and will not make any distributions on account of,
or in repurchase, retirement or purchase of its capital stock,
partnership or other equity interest, except as noted in the
agreement. In addition, the credit agreement requires the
Company to obtain prior written consent from the lender on
distributions on account of, or in repurchase, retirement or
purchase of its capital stock or other equity interests with the
exception of the following: adistributions of capital
stock from subsidiaries to The Boston Beer Company, Inc. and
Boston Beer Corporation a subsidiary of The Boston Beer
Company, Inc., brepurchase from former employees of
non-vested investment shares of ClassA Common Stock,
issued under the Employee Equity Incentive Plan, and
crepurchase of certain shares of ClassA Common
Stock as approved by the Board of Directors. In the event of a
default that has not been cured, the credit facility would
terminate and any unpaid principal and accrued interest would
become due and payable. 45 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves
dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax
regulations in several different state tax jurisdictions. The
Company is periodically reviewed by tax authorities regarding
the amount of taxes due. These reviews include questions
regarding the timing and amount of deductions, and the
allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In
evaluating the exposure associated with various filing
positions, the Company records estimated reserves for probable
exposures. Based on the Companys evaluation of current tax
positions, the Company believes it has appropriately accrued for
probable exposures. The Company includes its estimated reserves
for probable exposures in accrued expenses.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments The Company had outstanding non-cancelable purchase commitments
related to advertising contracts of approximately
$113million at December31, 2005, most of which are
expected to be incurred in fiscal 2006. The Company has entered into contracts for the supply of a
portion of its hops requirements. These purchase contracts
extend through crop year 2010 and specify both the quantities
and prices, denominated in Euros, which the Company is committed
to. The Company does not use forward currency exchange contracts
and intends to purchase future hops using the exchange rate at
the time of purchase. Purchases under these hops contracts were
approximately $39million, $40million and
$52million for fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. As of December31, 2005, hops purchase
commitments for each of the five succeeding fiscal years are as

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into
various production agreements with brewing companies. Title to
beer products brewed under contract arrangement remains with the
brewing company until the brewery ships the beer. The Company is
required to reimburse the supplier for all unused raw materials
and beer products on termination of these production contract
agreements. The Company is also obligated to meet annual volume
requirements in conjunction with certain production agreements.
During 47 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2005, the Company met all existing minimum volume requirements
in accordance with the production agreements, with the exception
of one brewery location. For that brewery, the fees associated
with not meeting minimum volume requirement were not significant
and have been recognized in the Companys consolidated
financial statements at December31, 2005. The Companys agreements with its contract breweries
require it to periodically purchase fixed assets in support of
brewery operations. As of December31, 2005, there were no
specific fixed asset purchase requirements outstanding under
existing contracts. Changes to the Companys brewing
strategy or existing production agreements, new production
relationships or introduction of new products in the future may
require the Company to purchase fixed assets to support the
contract breweries operations. Lease Commitments The Company has various operating lease agreements in place as
of December31, 2005, primarily involving real estate.
Terms of the leases include, in some instances, purchase
options, renewals, and maintenance costs, and vary by lease.
These lease obligations expire at various dates through 2009.
Rent expense was $13million in each of the fiscal years
2005, 2004 and 2003. Minimum annual rental payments under these agreements are as

The Companys lease for its existing office space in
Boston, Massachusetts expires at the end of September 2006. The
Company anticipates that it will relocate its corporate offices
within the City of Boston in September 2006 and expects to enter
into a new office lease agreement during the first or second
quarter 2006. Litigation The Company, along with numerous other alcohol beverage
producers, has been named as a defendant in a number of class
action law suits in several states relating to advertising
practices and underage consumption. Each complaint contains
substantially the same allegations that each defendant marketed
its products to underage consumers and seeks an injunction and
unspecified money damages on behalf of a class of parents and
guardians. The Company has been defending this litigation
vigorously. In September 2005, one of the complaints was
withdrawn by the plaintiffs. In February 2006, two of the
complaints were dismissed; however, the plaintiffs have appealed
the dismissal in one of the actions. The actions are in their
earliest stages and it is not possible at this time to determine
their likely impact on the Company. In November 2004, Royal Insurance Company of America and its
affiliate RICA, the Companys liability
insurer during most of the period covered by the
above-referenced complaints, filed a complaint in Ohio seeking
declaratory judgment that RICA owes no duty to defend or
indemnify the Company in the underlying actions filed in Ohio
and has subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment. In
July 2005, Royal Indemnity Company, successor in interest to
RICA and its affiliate Royal, filed a complaint in
New York seeking declaratory judgment that Royal owes no duty to
defend or indemnify the Company in five underlying actions filed
in states other than Ohio. In August 2005, the Massachusetts Bay
Insurance Company MBIC, the Companys
liability insurer for parts of 2004 and 2005, filed a complaint
in 48 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Massachusetts seeking declaratory judgment that MBIC owes no
duty to defend or indemnify the Company in the underlying
actions filed during the policy period and that MBIC owes no
duty to contribute to any obligation of Royal to defend or
indemnify the Company as to those underlying actions. While all
three declaratory judgment actions against the Company are in
their very early stages, the Company believes it has meritorious
defenses, that it is entitled to insurance coverage of its
defense costs with respect to the underlying class actions, and
that it is premature to litigate indemnification issues for the
class actions. However, the Company is not able to predict at
this time the ultimate outcome of these insurance coverage
disputes. The Company is not a party to any other pending or threatened
litigation, the outcome of which would be expected to have a
material adverse effect upon its financial condition or the
results of its operations.

Stock Repurchase Program The Board of Directors has approved up to $1000million
for the repurchase of the Companys ClassA Common
Stock. Through December31, 2005, the Company has
repurchased a total of approximately 77million shares of
its ClassA Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of
$873million. Treasury Stock Effective July1, 2004, companies incorporated in
Massachusetts became subject to the Massachusetts Business
Corporation Act, Chapter156D. Chapter156D provides
that shares that are reacquired by a company become authorized
but unissued shares under Section631, and thereby
eliminates the concept of treasury shares.
Accordingly, the Company has redesignated its existing treasury
shares as authorized but unissued and allocated the cost of
treasury stock to retained earnings.   
K.
Employee Retirement Plans The Company has one retirement plan covering substantially all
non-union employees and five retirement plans covering
substantially all union employees. Non-Union Plan The Boston Beer Company 401k Plan, which was established by
the Company in 1993, is a Company-sponsored defined contribution
plan that covers a majority of the Companys non-union
employees. All full-time, non-union employees over the age of 21
are eligible to participate in the plan on the first day of the
first month after commencing employment. Participants may make
voluntary contributions up to 60% of their annual compensation,
subject to IRS limitations. After the sixth month of employment,
the Company matches each employees contribution dollar for
dollar up to $1,000 and, thereafter, 50% of the employees
contribution up to 6% of the employees annual wages,
prorated during the first year of employment. The Company made
contributions of $05million to the Plan in each of the
fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003. 51 Table of Contents THE BOSTON BEER COMPANY, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Union Plans The Company has one Company-sponsored defined contribution plan
and four defined benefit plans, which combined cover
substantially all union employees. The defined benefit plans
include a Company-sponsored medical retirement plan, two
union-sponsored collectively bargained multi-employer pension
plans and a Company-sponsored defined pension plan. The Companys defined contribution plan, the Samuel Adams
Brewery Company, Ltd. 401k Plan for Represented Employees, was
established by the Company in 1997 and is available to all union
employees upon completion of one hour of full-time employment.
Participants may make voluntary contributions up to 60% of their
annual compensation to the Samuel Adams Brewery Company, Ltd.
401k Plan, subject to IRS limitations. The Company does not
make contributions to this plan, but does incur immaterial
administration costs. A comprehensive medical plan is offered to union employees who
have voluntarily retired at 65 or have become permanently
disabled. Employees must have worked for the Company or have
prior ownership for at least 10years at the Cincinnati
Brewery, been enrolled in the Companys medical insurance
plan and be eligible for Medicare benefits under the Social
Security Act. The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation
was determined using a discount rate of 55% at
September30, 2005, 58% at September30, 2004 and
63% at December27, 2003 and a 25% increase in the
Cincinnati Consumer Price Index for the years then ended. The
effect of a 1% point increase and the effect of a 1% point
decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates on the
aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net
periodic postretirement health care benefit costs and the
accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for health care
benefits were not significant. The actuarial and recorded
liabilities for this benefit have been funded within all
material respects as of December31, 2005 and
December25, 2004. The union-sponsored benefit plans are two multi-employer
retirement plans administrated by organized labor unions.
Information from the plans administrators is not
sufficient to permit the Company to determine its share, if any,
of the unfunded vested benefits. Pension expense and employer
contributions for these multi-employer plans were not
significant in the aggregate. The Company-sponsored defined pension plan, The Local
Union#1199 Defined Benefit Pension Plan the Local
1199 Plan, was established in 1991 and is eligible to all
union employees who are covered by the Companys collective
bargaining agreement and have completed twelve consecutive
months of employment with at least 750hours worked. The
defined benefit is determined based on years of service since
July 1991. The Company made combined contributions of
$01million to this plan in each of the fiscal years 2005,
2004 and 2003. Obligations and asset data of the Local 1199 Plan is presented

the Local 1199 Plans current asset mix of approximately
60% debt securities and 40% equity securities with assumed
average annual returns of approximately 5% to 6% for debt
securities and 10% to 12% for equity securities. It is assumed
that the Plans investment portfolio will be adjusted
periodically to maintain the current ratios of debt securities
and equity securities. Additional consideration is given to the
Plans historical returns as well as future long-range
projections of investment returns for each asset category. The Local 1199 Plans weighted-average asset allocations at

The Local 1199 Plan does not have formal investment strategies
but invests in a family of funds that are designed to minimize
excessive short-term risk and focus on consistent, competitive
long-term performance, consistent with the funds
investment objectives. The fund specific objectives vary and
include maximizing long-term returns both before and after
taxes, maximizing total return from capital appreciation plus
income and funds that invest primarily in common stock of
companies that cover a broad range of industries and that have
market capitalization of at least $5billion at the time of
purchase. The Company expects to contribute $01million to the Local
1199 Plan during the fiscal year 2006. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid in thousands
