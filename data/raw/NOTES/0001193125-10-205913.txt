Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
LeCroy Corporation: We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of LeCroy Corporation andsubsidiaries as of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the
53 week period ended July3, 2010 and the 52 week periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the valuation and qualifying accounts
financial statement schedule. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements
and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of LeCroy Corporation and subsidiaries as of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the 53 week period ended July3, 2010 and the 52 week periods ended June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for its convertible
notes on a retrospective basis due to the adoption of new accounting guidance for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement.

LeCROY CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In thousands, except share and per share amounts 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization 
LeCroy Corporation the Company or LeCroy, was founded and incorporated in the State of New York in 1964 and
reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 1995. The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance oscilloscopes and communication protocol analyzers. Oscilloscopes are tools used by designers and engineers to measure and
analyze complex electronic signals in order to develop high-performance systems, to validate electronic designs and to improve time to market. Protocol analyzers are tools used by designers and engineers to generate and monitor traffic over high
speed serial data interfaces, including USB 20, USB 30, Bluetooth, PCI Express, Serial ATA, Serial Attached SCSI SAS and others. The Companys products are sold worldwide into a broad range of industry sectors, including
Electronics, Data Storage, Automotive/Industrial, and Military/Aerospace. Revenues are also generated from the sale of probes, accessories, and applications solutions, and to a lesser extent, extended warranty and
maintenance contracts, repairs and calibrations performed on instruments after the expiration of their warranties. 
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of LeCroy Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. On June28, 2009, the Company retrospectively adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB staff position related to the accounting for convertible debt
instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial settlement See Note 12 Debt and Capital Leases for additional information. 
The Companys Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
US GAAP, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the period. The most significant of these estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition, reserves for accounts receivable, allowance for excess and obsolete
inventory, uncertain tax positions, valuation of deferred tax assets, the effective income tax rate and geographical distribution of taxable income, valuation of long-lived assets and goodwill, share-based compensation expense, estimation of
warranty liabilities and the separation of the Convertible notes between debt and equity. These estimates and assumptions are based on managements judgment and available information and, consequently, actual results could differ from these
estimates. The Companys fiscal years end on the Saturday closest to June30, resulting in an additional week of
results every five or six years. The fiscal year ended July3, 2010 represented a 53-week year, while the fiscal years endedJune27, 2009 and June28, 2008 represented a 52 week period. 
Revenue 
LeCroy recognizes product and service revenue, net of allowances for anticipated returns, provided that 1persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, 2delivery has occurred, 3the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4collection is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the
customer, or when services have been provided. The price is considered fixed or determinable when it is not subject to refund or adjustments. 
The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable estimated to be non-collectible. The Company
analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, 
57 Table of Contents
current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, the Company maintains, when appropriate, an
allowance for anticipated sales returns. The Company analyzes historical return trends as well as in-transit product returns to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for anticipated returns. 
Test and measurement products revenue. The Company generates Test and measurement product revenue from the sales of oscilloscopes
and application solutions, protocol analyzers, probes and accessories. Provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped. 
Application solutions, which provide oscilloscopes with additional analysis capabilities, are either delivered via compact disc or are
already loaded in the oscilloscopes and activated via a key code after the sale is made to the customer. No post-contract support is provided on the application solutions. All sales of Test and measurement products are based upon separately
established prices for the items and are recorded as revenue according to the above revenue recognition criteria. Revenues from oscilloscope products are included in revenues from Test and measurement products in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations, net of any applicable sales or value added taxes. Certain software is embedded in the Companys oscilloscopes, but the embedded software component is considered incidental. 
Currently, the Company recognizes revenue on the sales of its protocol analyzer products, due to their significant software content, in
accordance with specific software revenue recognition guidance, upon shipment, provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Software
maintenance support revenue is deferred based on its vendor specific objective evidence of fair value VSOE and recognized ratably over the maintenance support periods. In limited circumstances where VSOE does not exist for software
maintenance support, the Company recognizes revenue and accrues costs, if applicable, as determined by the facts and circumstances of each transaction. Provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time sales of related products are recognized
as revenue. Revenues from protocol analyzer products are included in Test and measurement products in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, net of any applicable sales or value added taxes. In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the
accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition. These amendments are effective at the beginning of fiscal 2011 and they modify the criteria for revenue recognition in multiple arrangements and what constitutes a non-software deliverable, as
described below, under New Accounting Pronouncements. In an effort to provide end-user customers an alternative
to purchasing the Companys higher end products under its standard terms and conditions, the Company offers customers an opportunity to enter into sales-type or direct financing leases for these products. Lease and rental revenues are reported
within Test and measurement product revenue and were approximately $09 million, $07 million and $18 million for the years ended July3, 2010,June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, respectively. 
Service and other revenue. Service and other revenue includes extended warranty contracts, software maintenance agreements,
repairs and calibrations performed on instruments after the expiration of their normal warranty period and direct service accessories and packages. The Company records deferred revenue for extended warranty contracts, software maintenance agreements
and calibrations services and recognizes such revenue on a straight-line basis over the related service period. When arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses relative fair values to allocate revenue to the elements and recognizes
revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal
2010, the Company entered into a research and development and distribution agreement with a third party. Both the Company and the third party are active participants in the development efforts and are exposed to risks and rewards dependent on the
commercial success of the product development. LeCroy is solely responsible for providing the development efforts contemplated under the agreement and will retain all title and intellectual property rights for any product developed under the
agreement. The Company will utilize its own personnel, facilities, equipment, computer software and information in order to meet the obligations under the agreement. The payments owed by the third party are nonrefundable and are not based on
milestone deliverables and are not tied directly to any development spending made by the Company. The Company 
58 Table of Contents
recognized $10 million in Service and other revenue related to this agreement in fiscal 2010. Revenue is being recognized ratably over the three year term of the agreement. Any research and
development costs incurred in conjunction with this arrangement are recognized as incurred. Deferred license revenue.
Revenue from license fees under agreements that have exclusivity clauses and, from the licensees perspective, have ongoing requirements or expectations that are more than perfunctory, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms
of the related agreements. An ongoing requirement or expectation would be considered more than perfunctory if any party to the contract considers it to be essential to the functionality of the delivered product or service or failure to
complete the activities would result in the customer receiving a full or partial refund or rejecting the products delivered or services performed to date. 
Share -Based Compensation 
The Company recognizes the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values. The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant, while the fair value for cash settled stock appreciation
rights is estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period, since it is liability-classified. Determining the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights requires certain estimates by management including the
expected volatility and expected term of the option. Management also makes decisions regarding the risk free interest rate used in the model and makes estimates regarding forfeiture rates. Fluctuations in the market or other factors that affect
these estimates could have a material impact on the resulting compensation cost. The fair value of restricted stock grants referred to as non-vested stock is determined based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant. Related compensation expense is recognized ratably over the associated requisite service period, giving effect to estimated forfeitures. 
During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company made the election to use the alternative transition method of calculating the pool
of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies the APIC Pool; however, the alternative method does not have an impact on the Companys results of operations or financial condition due to the Companys net
operating loss position for tax purposes. Business Realignment and Related Asset Impairment Costs 
The Company records realignment charges related to workforce reductions, including contractual termination benefits related to employee
severance when they are probable and estimable, in accordance with the ongoing severance policy. The Companys policy for recording the impairment of long-lived assets is described below in the section titled, Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets. Restructuring Charges 
Charges associated with an exit or disposal activity are measured and recognized initially at fair value, only when the liability is
incurred. Related to restructuring exit activities, the Company may also have involuntary terminations that are accounted for under the severance policy discussed above or as restructuring charges, if the severance and related costs are considered
to be a one-time benefit arrangement outside of the Companys ongoing severance policy. Shipping and Handling
Costs Beginning in fiscal 2009, the Company changed its accounting policy to classify certain shipping and handling
costs as Cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The amounts classified as Cost of revenues represent shipping and handling costs associated with the distribution of finished product from their point of manufacturing directly
to customers, distributors and wholly-owned international subsidiaries. Management 
59 Table of Contents
believes that the classification of these shipping and handling costs as Cost of revenues better reflects the cost of producing and distributing its products and aligns external financial
reporting with the results used internally to evaluate the Companys operational performance. Shipping and handling costs associated with the transportation of demonstration units shipped to sales personnel and customers, as well as
distribution costs associated with servicing the Companys international customers through its foreign sales offices are recorded as Selling, general and administrative SGA, as they are considered direct selling expenses.
For purposes of comparability, approximately $18 million of shipping and handling costs previously classified as SGA
for fiscal year ending June28, 2008 have been reclassified to Cost of revenues to apply the new policy.The remaining shipping and handling costs within SGA totaled approximately $12 million, $13 million and $13 million for the
fiscal years ended July3, 2010,June27, 2009 and June28, 2008, respectively. This change in accounting principle and reclassification had no impact on operating loss income, net loss income, or net loss income per share.
Advertising Costs 
The costs of general advertising, promotion and marketing programs are charged to Selling, general and administrative expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations in the fiscal year incurred. The costs of advertising related to new product introductions are deferred until such advertising first takes place, which generally coincides with product introduction. Advertising
expense for the fiscal years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 was approximately $20 million, $24 million and $28 million, respectively. 
Research and Development 
The costs related to research, design and development of test and measurement products are charged to Research and development expense as
incurred. The Company evaluates the requirement to capitalize certain software development costs for protocol analyzers. The costs incurred to develop or significantly enhance computer software products are charged to Research and development
expense as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. The nature of the Companys development for protocol analyzers is generally such that the Company can measure technological feasibility most effectively using the working
model method where the time between establishment of a working model and general availability is of short duration which results in very little or no costs that qualify for capitalization. As such, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs for the years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009 and June28, 2008. Cash and Cash
Equivalents Cash in excess of current operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents, which are short-term,
highly liquid interest bearing investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not
improve or extend the life of the respective asset are expensed as incurred and major betterments are capitalized. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on a straight-line basis over the assets estimated useful life or
related lease term, if shorter, as follows:  Building and improvements
10-32years
Furniture, machinery and equipment
2-10years
Computer software and hardware
2-7 years 
60 Table of Contents
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market, with the exception of demonstration units in finished
goods. Costs include material, labor and overhead charges. Demonstration units are accounted for as inventory since they are sold in the normal course of business and are stated at lower of cost specific identification method or market.
The Company reviews the valuation of inventory on a quarterly basis and provides an allowance for the value of estimated
excess and obsolete raw materials and work in process inventory. The Companys marketing department plays a key role in the inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with the
manufacturing department to maximize recovery of excess inventory. Based upon managements forecast, inventory items no longer expected to be used or saleable in the future are considered obsolete and the difference between an inventorys
quantity and its forecasted usage or sale are classified as excess. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory allowances for excess or obsolete inventory may be required. 
Warranty 
The Company provides a warranty on its products, generally extending between one and three years after delivery, and is accounted for as
a contingency. Estimated future warranty obligations related to products are provided by charges to Cost of revenues in the period that the related revenue is recognized. These estimates are derived from historical data of product reliability and,
for certain new products, third party published expected failure rates. The expected failure rate is arrived at in terms of units, which are then converted into labor hours to which an average fully burdened cost per hour is applied to derive the
amount of accrued warranty required. The Company studies trends of warranty claims and performance of specific products and adjusts its warranty obligation through charges or credits to Cost of revenues. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Acquired Intangible Assets 
The Company monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including
amortizable intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, the Company assesses the recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted
expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. 
Impairment of Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process which requires the Company to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value. Testing is required between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that
could reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. Such an event may occur if, for an extended period of time, the market value of the Companys common stock plus a control premium were less than the carrying value of
the Company. Impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value-based test. A reporting
unit is defined as the same as or one level below the operating segment level. The Company has one reporting unit, in the Test and Measurement business, because none of the components of the Company constitute a business for which discrete financial
information is available and for which Company management regularly reviews the results of operations. The first step of the
impairment test is to identify if an impairment of goodwill has occurred by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit
61 Table of Contents
exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill test
is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. In this second step, the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of the goodwill. 
As the Company consists of only one reporting unit, and is publicly traded, management estimates the fair value of its reporting unit
utilizing the Companys market capitalization, multiplying the number of actual shares outstanding by an average market price over a reasonable period of time considered appropriate to determine fair value, as reflected on the NASDAQ Stock
Market, LLC, and applying an additional premium to give effect to the Companys best estimate of a control premium, as if the Company were to be acquired by a single stockholder, which seeks to give effect to the increased consideration a
potential acquirer would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and make decisions related to the Company. 
The control premium is not a standard amount based on broad assumptions; rather, the amount is based on detailed analysis that considers
appropriate industry, market, economic and other pertinent factors, including, indications of such premiums from data on recent acquisition transactions. The control premium is reviewed taking into consideration current industry, market and economic
conditions along with other factors or available information specific to the Companys business. Managements estimate of an appropriate control premium to apply in determining fair value is an important variable in the Companys
goodwill impairment assessment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company changed its annual impairment testing date
from fiscal year end to the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year. The Company believes the last day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year is preferable as it provides the Company additional time to complete the impairment test and
report the results of that test in the Companys annual filing on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of fiscal 2009, as a
result of the deteriorating economic environment and sustained decline in the Companys stock price since September27, 2008, which affected the Companys market capitalization, the Company performed the first step of its goodwill
impairment test and determined that its carrying value exceeded its fair value, indicating that goodwill was impaired. The Company performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill by
allocating the fair value of the Company determined in the first step to all assets and liabilities other than goodwill, including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, and compared it to the carrying amount of goodwill in order to
determine the amount of the goodwill impairment. As a result, in fiscal 2009 the Company recorded approximately $1058 million of goodwill impairment, reducing the carrying value of Goodwill to zero. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
The Company develops, manufactures, sells and licenses high-performance oscilloscopes, serial data analyzers and communication protocol
test solutions. The Companys products are sold into a broad range of end markets, including  Electronics, Data Storage, Automotive/Industrial, and Military/Aerospace markets. Sales occur in all regions of the
United States as well as a many foreign countries. No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years. There is no significant concentration of the Companys accounts
receivable portfolio in any customer or geographical region that presents a risk to the Company based on that concentration. The Company performs on-going credit evaluations of its customers. Credit risk may sometimes be partially mitigated through
collateral such as letters of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms such as cash in advance. The Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses. Credit losses have been minimal in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Income Taxes 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized under the asset and liability method based upon the difference between the amounts
reported for financial reporting and tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying current enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that
includes the enactment date. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets, such
as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards, will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized. The Company considers all available positive
and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are realizable. 
The realization of deferred tax assets, after accounting for tax exposures, is based on the assessment that it is more likely than not
that the Company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income within statutory carryforward periods to realize the deferred tax assets. Adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the
realizable amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded. Such adjustments may be material to the Companys financial position and results of operations. 
The Companys policy is not to provide for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent such earnings
are determined to be permanently invested outside the United States. Effective July1, 2007, the Company adopted a
comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. A tax benefit from an uncertain tax position
may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized
upon settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax benefit from an uncertain position was previously recognized if it was probable of being sustained. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is
classified as non-current unless the liability is expected to be settled in cash within twelve months of the reporting date. Interest and penalties related to income taxes is included in the benefit provision for income taxes line of the
Consolidated Statement of Operations. Foreign Exchange 
The Companys foreign subsidiaries generally use their local currency as the functional currency and translate all assets and
liabilities at fiscal year-end exchange rates and all income and expenses at average fiscal year exchange rates with translation adjustments recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of Stockholders equity in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, related to short-term intercompany loans, are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred. The foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in Accumulated
other comprehensive income, a component of Stockholders equity, for intercompany loans that are considered long-term in nature. 
Financial Instruments 
Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets equal or approximate their fair value due to their short term to maturity. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit have variable interest rates and their carrying amounts are considered by management to be a reasonable estimate
of their fair value. 
63 Table of Contents
Derivative Instruments 
The Company is exposed to global market exchange rate risks and, as a result, enters into forward exchange contracts to manage financial
exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency rates. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. The accounting for changes in the fair value i.e., gains or losses of a derivative instrument
is dependent upon whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Companys foreign exchange forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges and
therefore, any changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The Company manages its foreign exchange exposure by entering into short-term forward exchange agreements to purchase foreign currencies
at set rates in the future. These foreign currency forward exchange agreements are used to reduce exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Companys
functional currencies. The Company records these short-term forward exchange agreements on the balance sheet at fair value in Other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in the fair values of these contracts
are recorded in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are inversely correlated to changes in the value of certain of the Companys foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. New Accounting Pronouncements 
Recent pronouncements not yet adopted 
In October 2009, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition. These amendments, effective for
fiscal years beginning on or after June15, 2010, modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non-software deliverable. 
The FASBs amendments related to multiple element arrangements include: 1.
Updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated;
2.
Establishment of a selling price hierarchy as a means to determine the selling price of a deliverable. If an entity does not have vendor-specific objective evidence of
selling price VSOE or third-party evidence of selling price TPE, then estimated selling price ESP may be used;  3.
Eliminating the use of the residual method by requiring an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method; and 4.
Enhanced disclosures to provide information about a vendors multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms,
significant deliverables and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require disclosure of significant judgments and how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
Non-software deliverables 
The FASB amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and
non-software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality from the scope of industry-specific software revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what
software elements are considered essential to the functionality. These changes allow software-enabled products to be scoped out of specific software revenue recognition models. Software-enabled products will be subject to other revenue
guidance and disclosure requirements, such as the guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, as discussed above. 
64 Table of Contents
The Company will prospectively apply the new revenue recognition guidance in the first
quarter of fiscal 2011 and believes its adoption will not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations, but may require enhanced disclosures. 
Recent pronouncements adopted 
In September 2006, FASB issued new accounting guidance on fair value measurements, effective beginning in fiscal 2009. This guidance
established a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB deferred the effective date until the beginning of the Companys 2010 fiscal year, as it relates to fair value
measurement requirements for non-financial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis. This includes fair value calculated in impairment assessments of long-lived assets. The Company adopted the new guidance as
it relates to non-financial assets and liabilities and it did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial position and results of operations at the date of adoption, although it may impact the way that fair value for
non-financial assets and liabilities is determined in future periods. In December 2007, the FASB issued new guidance on
business combinations. It established the principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value. Further, it required that acquisition-related costs be expensed as incurred, restructuring costs be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date and changes in accounting for
deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be included in income tax expense. Additionally, disclosure requirements were established to enable users of the financial statements
to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The new accounting guidance applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December15, 2008, with the exception of adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. The Company will apply the provisions under the new guidance to future adjustments made to
valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of the Companys 2010 fiscal year. At July3, 2010, approximately $25 million of unrecognized tax
benefits are related to a prior acquisition and would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. In May 2008, the FASB
issued a staff position on new accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement. The staff position requires cash settled convertible debt to be separated into debt and
equity components at issuance and a value to be assigned to each. The value assigned to the debt component will be the estimated fair value, as of the issuance date, of a similar bond without the conversion feature. The difference between the cash
proceeds and this estimated fair value will be recorded as a debt discount, with an offset to equity, and will be amortized to interest expense, using the effective interest method, over the life of the Convertible notes. The guidance was effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008 and for interim periods within those years and required retrospective application. The Company adopted the staff position in fiscal 2010 and has retrospectively
applied it to prior periods See Note 12 Debt and Capital Leases for additional information. In April
2009, the FASB issued a staff position requiring fair value disclosures in both interim as well as annual financial statements in order to provide more timely information about the effects of current market conditions on financial instruments. The
guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after June15, 2009. The Company adopted the enhanced disclosures required in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and adoption did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position or results of operations. In June 2009, the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
Codification was issued. The Codification is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The Codification does not change U.S. GAAP; instead, it introduces a new structure
that is organized in an easily accessible, user-friendly online research system. The Codification, which changes the referencing of financial standards, becomes effective for interim and annual periods ending on or after September15, 2009. The
implementation of the Codification did not have any impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Initiatives 
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, as a result of the economic downturn and resulting business realignment decisions affecting
personnel in Europe, the Company vacated certain space at its Swiss facility. This resulted in a restructuring charge to SGA expense of approximately $07 million, which represented the present value of the estimated future cash payments, net
of estimated subrental income and expense, through the remainder of the lease term which will expire in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. As of July3, 2010, approximately $02 million remains in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities
and approximately $04 million remains in Deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Fiscal
2009 Business Realignment and Related Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, in an effort to further
streamline expenses in response to the economic environment, the Company recorded severance of approximately $02 million, of which less than $01 million was expensed to Cost of revenues, approximately $01 million was expensed to SGA and less
than $01 million was expensed to Research and development. This resulted from headcount reductions of twelve employees or approximately 26% of the workforce as compared to June28, 2008. As of July3, 2010, approximately $02 million has
been paid in cash and no liability remains. In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, in an effort to further streamline expenses

quarter of fiscal 2009, in an effort to streamline expenses in anticipation of further deterioration in the economic environment, the Company recorded severance of approximately $15 million, of which approximately $01 million was expensed to Cost
of revenues, approximately $08 million was expensed to SGA and approximately $06 million was expensed to Research and development. This resulted from headcount reductions of ten employees or 22% of the workforce as compared to June28,
2008. As of July3, 2010, approximately $15 million has been paid in cash and no liability remains. Fiscal 2008 Business Realignment
and Related Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Catalyst trade name failed the impairment test as
a result of a change in the Companys product strategy, and therefore, the Company recorded an approximate $07 million non-cash charge to SGA expense for the impairment. 
In the third quarter of fiscal 2008, as a result of streamlining operational management processes and staffing requirements, the Company
recorded severance of approximately $03 million, which was expensed to SGA. This resulted from headcount reductions of three employees or 07% of the workforce as compared to June30, 2007. Severance and other related amounts under this
plan were fully paid in fiscal 2009 and no liability remains. In the first quarter of fiscal 2008, primarily as the result of
an effort to improve sales effectiveness and channel management, the Company recorded severance of approximately $06 million, which was expensed to SGA. This resulted from headcount reductions of twelve employees or 27% of the workforce as
compared to June30, 2007. Severance and other related amounts under this plan were fully paid in fiscal 2009 and no liability remains.

Companys net deferred tax assets were included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other current assets, $66 million and $56 million, respectively, were included in Other noncurrent assets, and $02 million and $03 million,
respectively, of deferred tax liabilities were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. A valuation
allowance of approximately $20 million and $19 million existed as of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, respectively, for certain tax credit carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty
surrounding the utilization of these deferred tax assets. During the years ended July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the valuation allowance increased by less than $01 million and approximately $02 million, respectively. The increases were
mainly due to increases in foreign net operating loss carryforwards and uncertainty surrounding the utilization of such carryforwards. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the
Companys net deductible temporary differences, net of the valuation allowance. The Company is required to recognize a
valuation allowance for all or a portion of its deferred tax assets if it believes that it is more likely than not, given the weight of all available evidence, that all or a portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management
assesses the realizability of the deferred tax assets at each interim and annual balance sheet date based on actual and forecasted operating results. The Company assessed both its positive and negative evidence to determine the proper amount of its
required valuation allowance. The recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based on the assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize its deferred tax assets within statutory
carryforward periods. 
72 Table of Contents
The factors that the Company considered in assessing the likelihood of realization of the
deferred tax assets include: the Companys past operating results; the nature and existence of cumulative losses in recent years, which were principally due to a non-recurring goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2009, acquisition and business
realignment charges and non-cash amortization of convertible debt; the forecast of future taxable income; the reversal of taxable temporary differences; excess of appreciated asset value over the basis of net assets; the duration of statutory
carryforward periods of net operating losses and tax credits; the Companys positive experience with U.S. net operating loss carryforwards not expiring unused; and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize a portion
of the deferred tax assets. As a result of the review of the quantitative and qualitative information, the Company concluded that sufficient positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence from recent losses to determine that it is more likely
than not the Company will realize its remaining deferred tax assets not already subject to a valuation allowance. Adjustments to the valuation allowance may be made in the future if it is determined that the realizable amount of net operating losses
and other deferred tax assets is greater or less than the amount recorded. Such adjustments may be material to the Companys financial position, and results of operations. 
At July3, 2010, the Companys net U.S. domestic deferred tax assets amounted to approximately $106 million. Management has
considered the realizability of the deferred tax assets and has concluded that a domestic valuation allowance of approximately $14 million should be recorded, mainly related to certain tax credit carryforwards that are not anticipated to be
realized. Although management determined that a valuation allowance was not required with respect to the remaining net U.S. domestic deferred tax assets, realization of these assets is primarily dependent on achieving the forecast of future taxable
income, as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The Company based its forecast of future taxable income on
actual taxable income achieved in fiscal 2010 following business realignment activities, excluding any future growth in revenues attributable to an economic recovery. Unexpected decreases in revenues below levels achieved in fiscal 2010, or an
inability to sustain cost reductions achieved, or unanticipated future business realignment or other charges would adversely affect the forecast of future taxable income and may result in the need for an additional valuation allowance which could be
material. At July3, 2010, the Company requires approximately $38 million in cumulative future taxable income to be generated at various times in the future to realize the net U.S. domestic deferred tax assets. Based upon the Companys
forecast of future taxable income, the U.S. domestic net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credit carryforwards would be fully utilized before expiration. If required, the Company also has prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that
have been and may be used to prevent net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards from expiring unused and prolong their lives. 
Historically, it has been the practice of the Company to reinvest unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In a previous fiscal year,
however, the Company determined that it would repatriate approximately $70 million in future periods from its foreign subsidiaries. The Company believes repatriation of these earnings will result in additional taxes in the amount of $16 million
and provided for that amount in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The cumulative amount of all other undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries, for which U.S. federal income tax has not been provided, was approximately $106 million
and $109 million at July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, respectively. These earnings, which reflect full provision for non-U.S. income taxes, are anticipated to be reinvested permanently outside the United States. Determining the U.S. income
tax liability that might result if these earnings were remitted is not practicable.

Fiscal 2018 The Company
operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within and outside the United States. At July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to federal, state and foreign taxes and accrued interest was
approximately $104 million and $108 million, respectively, of which all would impact the effective tax rate if recognized. As of July3, 2010, the Company has approximately $104 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which, approximately
$13 million are reflected as a non-current liability and approximately $91 million are reflected as a reduction of gross deferred tax assets. 
The Company believes it is reasonably possible that approximately $01 million of net unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized during
the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and impact the Companys effective tax rate. 
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S., various states and in foreign jurisdictions. For federal and foreign income tax
purposes, the fiscal 2007 through 2010 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities. For state tax purposes, principally California and New York fiscal 2006 through 2010 tax years remain open for examination by the tax authorities.
The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended July3, 2010 and June27,
2009 were as follows in thousands:  July3,2010 June27,2009 Beginning balance 10,802 10,409 Additions for current year tax positions 144 236 Additions for prior year tax positions 393 Reduction of tax related to expiration of statute of limitations 482 222 Reduction of interest related to expiration of statute of limitations 31 33 Additional interest 14 19 Ending balance 10,447 10,802 In accordance with the Companys accounting policy, interest expense and penalties related to income
taxes are and have been included in the income tax expense line of the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties which could be assessed related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. For the years ended July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the Company recognized less than $01 million for interest expense related to uncertain tax positions. As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the total amount
of accrued interest and penalties, before federal and, if applicable, state effect, was also less than $01 million. The Company made no accrual for penalties related to income tax positions.

12. Debt and Capital Leases 
Credit Agreement 
On March30, 2007, the Company entered into a $400 million senior, secured, four-year credit agreement with the lenders listed
therein and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company MT Bank, as administrative agent for such lenders the Prior Credit Agreement, which replaced an existing credit facility. The terms of the Prior Credit Agreement
provided LeCroy with a $400 million revolving credit facility Revolver, which includes a $50 million swingline loan subfacility and a $50 million letter of credit subfacility. The performance by LeCroy of its obligations under the
Prior Credit Agreement is secured by all of the domestic assets of LeCroy and its domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by LeCroys domestic subsidiaries. 
Effective as of April26, 2007, LeCroy entered into a First Modification and Lender Joinder Agreement Joinder
Agreement. This Joinder Agreement increased the Companys credit limit to $500 million and added Capital One Bank formerly North Fork Bank to the Prior Credit Agreement. On May7, 2008, the Company entered into a Second
Modification Agreement to modify certain financial and negative covenants of its Prior Credit Agreement and on May4, 2009 the Company entered into a Third Modification Agreement to further modify certain financial and negative covenants, as
well as the effective interest rates, of its Prior Credit Agreement. The Company had $170 million and $175 million of
outstanding borrowings against the Revolver as of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, respectively. The Company did not have any borrowings against the letter of credit subfacility or the swingline loan subfacility as of July3, 2010 and
June27, 2009. Borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement, bear interest at variable rates, based upon LeCroys
senior leverage ratio, equal to, at the Companys election, 1the higher of athe prime rate or bthe federal funds rate plus 05%, or cone-month London Interbank Offering Rate LIBOR as defined in the
Prior Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin of between 175% and 275%, or 2LIBOR plus an applicable margin of between 275% and 375%. The Prior Credit Agreement provides for a LIBOR floor of 150% and requires the Company to pay
commitment fees on unused revolver borrowings during the term of the Prior Credit Agreement at rates between 025% and 05% dependent upon its senior leverage ratio. 
The Prior Credit Agreement contains, among other things, conditions precedent, covenants, representations and warranties and events of
default. Negative covenants include certain restrictions or limitations on, among other things, the incurrence of indebtedness; liens; consolidations and mergers; investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions; sales of assets, subject to
customary exceptions for sales of inventory in the ordinary course and sales of equipment in connection with the replacement thereof in the ordinary course; sale and lease-back transactions; hedging agreements; and restricted payments, including
repurchase of a portion of the Convertible notes not to exceed $500 million of face value or $260 million of cash, dividends and stock repurchases. As of July3, 2010, the Company had the ability to repurchase up to an additional approximate
$177 million face value, utilizing up to approximately $54 million of cash. The Company is required to comply with certain
financial covenants, measured quarterly, including: a minimum interest coverage ratio; minimum total net worth, which includes deferred tax assets; maximum leverage ratio; minimum fixed charge coverage ratio; and limitations on capital expenditures.
As of July3, 2010, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants under the Prior Credit Agreement. The
Company incurred approximately $02 million of financing costs in connection with entering into the Third Modification Agreement. Total financing costs in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement were approximately $08 million, which were
deferred and are being amortized, on a straight line basis, over the term of the Prior Credit Agreement. At July3, 2010, approximately $02 million of deferred financing costs were included in Other current assets and less than $01 million
were included in Other non-current assets. The Prior Credit Agreement would have expired on July15, 2011, unless, in
the absence of any default, extended by LeCroy to April1, 2012, contingent on the waiver or extension of the first redemption date of the 
75 Table of Contents
Companys Convertible notes. On July29, 2010, LeCroy Corporation entered into an Amended and Restated $500 million Senior Secured Credit agreement the New Credit
Agreement. The New Credit Agreement allows for the repayment of the Convertible notes in fiscal 2012 and extends the expiration date of the agreement to fiscal 2014. It is the Companys intention to repay the Convertible notes in fiscal
2012 through a combination of cash generated from operations, working capital and new secured bank debt and will also include possible future financing sources such as: ithe sale or monetization of certain assets; iinew unsecured
debt and additional amendments to existing debt; and iiiissuance of equity and/or equity-like securities. See Note 23 Subsequent Events for additional information. 
Convertible Debt 
On October12, 2006, the Company sold and issued $720million in convertible senior subordinated notes to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 400%per annum, payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each April15 and
October15, beginning April15, 2007. The Notes are direct, unsecured, senior subordinated obligations of the Company and rank: isubordinate in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness;
iiequal in right of payment with all of the Companys existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness, and iiisenior in right of payment to all of the Companys existing and future subordinated indebtedness, except that
the Notes ranked equally with the $35 million note issued in connection with the Catalyst acquisition, which was fully repaid in fiscal 2008. In connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes, the Company entered into an indenture dated as of
October12, 2006, with U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. The terms of the Notes are governed by the indenture. 
The Notes mature on October15, 2026 unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted. Holders of the Notes will have the right to
require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes on each of October15, 2011,October15, 2016 and October15, 2021, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be
repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including, the repurchase date. The Company may, from time to time, at its option repurchase the Notes in the open market. In addition, the Company may redeem the Notes for cash,
either in whole or in part, anytime after October20, 2011 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but not including the redemption date. The Notes
are convertible into Company common stock by the holders at an initial conversion rate equal to 687285 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $1455 per share, subject to adjustment as
described in the indenture. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes, an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of $1,000 and the conversion value, as defined in the indenture and, to the extent that
the conversion value exceeds $1,000, at the Companys election, cash or shares of Company common stock in respect of the remainder. Prior to September15, 2026, holders may convert their notes into cash and shares of the Companys
common stock, if any, at the applicable conversion rate, at their option, only under limited circumstances described in the indenture. On or after September15, 2026, holders may convert their notes into cash and shares of the Companys
common stock, if any, at the applicable conversion price, at the Companys option, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion of each $1,000 principal amount of the
notes, the holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i$1,000 or iithe conversion value, as described in the indenture; if the conversion value exceeds $1,000 on the conversion date, the Company will also deliver,
at the Companys election, cash or common stock or combination of each with a value equal to such excess. The Company
evaluated the accounting for the conversion feature at the date of issuance of the Notes and determined that the conversion feature would be equity-classified if it were a stand-alone instrument, and, therefore, it did not need to be accounted for
separately from the Notes. If the Company undergoes a change in control, as defined in the indenture, holders of
the Notes will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any. 
76 Table of Contents
In connection with the sale of its Notes, the Company also entered into a Registration
Rights Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company filed a shelf registration statement, which has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering resales by holders of the Notes and any common
stock issuable upon conversion of such Notes, subject to certain conditions specified in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement effective until the earliest
of the following has occurred: iall securities covered by the registration statement have been sold pursuant to the registration statement or Rule 144 under the Securities Act; iithe holders of the Notes and the shares of the
Companys common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes that are not affiliates are able to sell all such securities immediately pursuant to Rule 144k under the Securities Act; iiithe date when all of the Notes and shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion have ceased to be outstanding; and ivOctober12, 2008. No amounts are owed, nor have any been recorded for failure to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement. 
As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the market value of the Convertible notes was approximately $375 million and $277
million, respectively. Fair value is determined through information obtained from a third party using the latest available market data. 
Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments 
During the first fiscal quarter of 2010, ending on October3, 2009, LeCroy was required to adopt new accounting guidance which
requires issuers of certain types of convertible notes to separately account for the liability and equity components of such convertible notes in a manner that reflects the entitys nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is
recognized in subsequent periods. Prior to adoption, the liability of the Convertible notes was carried at its principal value and only the contractual interest expense was recognized in LeCroys Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because
the new guidance requires retrospective application, LeCroy was required to adjust all periods for which the Convertible notes were outstanding prior to the date of adoption. 
Upon adoption and effective as of the issuance date of the Convertible notes, LeCroy recorded approximately $179 million of the
principal amount to equity, representing a debt discount for the difference between LeCroys estimated nonconvertible debt borrowing rate of 105% at the time and the 40% coupon rate of the Convertible notes. This debt discount is amortized as
interest expense over the contractual term of the notes using the effective interest method. In addition, LeCroy allocated approximately $07 million of the issuance costs to the equity component of the Convertible notes and approximately $23
million of the issuance costs to the debt component of the Convertible notes. The issuance costs were allocated pro rata based on the initial allocation of debt and equity components. The approximate $23 million of debt issuance costs allocated to
the debt component is amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the Convertible notes using the effective interest method, while the portion allocated to the equity component was charged to Additional paid-in capital at issuance
date. The term of the Convertible notes for amortization purposes is considered to be five years, as that is the first period in which the redemption feature of the Notes can be executed by either the Noteholders or LeCroy and therefore is
considered the mandatory redemption date. As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, approximately $04 million and $08 million, respectively, of unamortized fees related to the Notes were included in Other non-current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company also retroactively applied the derecognition guidance. Upon repurchase, the fair
value of the liability component immediately prior to extinguishment was measured first and the difference between the fair value of the aggregate consideration paid and the fair value of the liability component was attributed to the reacquisition
of the equity component.

500million yen that was cancelled in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. No amounts were outstanding under this facility as of the time of cancellation and as of July3, 2010. The Companys Swiss subsidiary has an overdraft facility
totaling 10million Swiss francs or approximately $09 million as of July3, 2010. As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, approximately 04million Swiss francs were held against supplier obligations leaving an available
balance of 06million Swiss francs under this credit facility. These obligations to Swiss suppliers, such as rent and utilities, are payable under the credit facility only in the event that the subsidiary is unable to meet its financial
obligations to those suppliers.

Capital Lease Agreements 
During fiscal 2005, the Company entered into vendor supplied capital lease agreements for technology rights of approximately $13
million. These leases bore interest at 45% to 488% and were fully paid by the first quarter of fiscal 2008. During fiscal
2008, the Company acquired a software license under a capital lease agreement for approximately $07 million. The lease bears interest at 775% with a three-year term. At July3, 2010, the Companys outstanding balance under this agreement
was approximately $01 million and was included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Future minimum lease payments required during fiscal year 2011 are approximately $01 million. 
13.Share-Based Compensation 
Total share-based compensation expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended July3, 2010,
June27, 2009, and June28, 2008 is approximately $44 million, $28 million, and $47 million, respectively. 
Approximately less than $02 million, $01 million and less than $01 million of compensation cost was capitalized in inventory for the
year ended July3, 2010,June27, 2009, and June28, 2008, respectively. Company Stock-Based Plans

Shares available for grant as options under all Company stock-based plans were 2,114,018 and 1,668,345 at July3, 2010 and
June27, 2009, respectively. These amounts include 711,452 and 93,230 shares at July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, respectively, under the ESPP Plan. 
The 1993 Plan expired on January4, 2003. All options outstanding under the 1993 Plan at the time of its expiration will continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. The lives of the options are generally ten years from the date of grant. 
In October 1998, the Board of Directors and stockholders terminated the 1995 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan 1995
Plan and adopted the 1998 Plan. Pursuant to the 1998 Plan, each non-employee director receives upon initial election to the Board of Directors either a stock option grant of 15,000 shares to vest ratably over 36 months, or a restricted stock
award of 10,000 shares of common stock, subject to such vesting and other conditions and restrictions as the Board may determine at its discretion. A total of 500,000 shares of common stock can be issued during the term of the 1998 Plan. The 1998
Plan expires on October27, 2010. In fiscal 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors revised the Board
compensation such that each non-employee director will receive annually, at their election, an immediately vested restricted stock award and/or an immediately vested stock option award using the Black Scholes valuation technique equal to $85,000,
based on the closing price of the Companys stock on the Annual Shareholder Meeting date, rounded up or down to the nearest hundred shares. The compensation was effective for equity awards granted at the November3, 2008 Annual Shareholder
Meeting, which resulted in approximately 32,000 immediately vested options and 
82 Table of Contents
approximately 57,000 of immediately vested restricted stock being granted to the non-employee directors. Additionally, each non-employee director receives upon initial election to the Board of
Directors, either a stock option grant of 22,500 shares with an exercise price set as the date of the election, or 7,500 shares of restricted stock, as selected by the Board to vest over a three year period. As a result of a new board member being
elected to the Board, the Company issued 7,500 shares of restricted stock in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, the compensation for equity awards granted at the November18, 2009 Annual Shareholder Meeting, which resulted in a total of approximately
121,000 immediately vested options and approximately 48,000 of immediately vested restricted stock being granted to the non-employee directors. The immediately vested restricted shares were granted out of the 2008 Plan. 
The 2003 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards to employees
including officers and employee directors and consultants. Unless approved by stockholders owning a majority of shares present and entitled to vote at a duly convened meeting of stockholders of the Company, the purchase price of any option granted
under the 2003 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or restricted stock awards
under the 2003 Plan is 1,560,167 shares. The 2003 Plan also allows for awards based on performance criteria. Such awards may then qualify as performance-based compensation under Section162m of the Internal Revenue Code. The
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2003 Plan and has the authority to determine the terms of such options or awards including the number of shares, exercise or purchase prices and times at which the options become and
remain exercisable or restricted stock is no longer restricted. In fiscal 2010, 39,500 options have been granted under the 2003 Plan. There have been no performance-based awards granted under the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan expires on October29,
2013. In connection with the CATC Merger, on October29, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved the 2004
Plan to promote the interests of the Company and its stockholders by strengthening the Companys ability to attract and induce persons to become employees of the Company, including certain of CATCs employees. The adoption of the 2004 Plan
did not require stockholder approval. The number of shares of LeCroy common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or restricted stock awards granted under the 2004 Plan is 750,000 shares. On October29, 2004, the Company
issued the following grants under the 2004 Plan: i70,000 shares of restricted common stock to certain former officers of CATC, and iioptions to purchase an aggregate of 230,984 shares of common stock to 61 former CATC employees who
became non-officer employees of LeCroy none of whom received an option grant of more than 20,000 shares. The options were issued with vesting periods of four to six years. On September13, 2005, the Board of Directors resolved that no further
grants would be made under the 2004 Plan. The 2004 Plan expires on October29, 2014. In connection with the CATC Merger,
LeCroy assumed the LeCroy CATC Plans. On October27, 2004, the Board of Directors of CATC approved technical amendments to each of the CATC Stock Plans in anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy pursuant to the CATC Merger including,
without limitation, amendments reflecting that any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable for LeCroy common stock. On September13, 2005, the Board of Directors resolved that no further grants would be made under
the LeCroy CATC Plans. In connection with the Catalyst Merger, LeCroy assumed Catalysts 2005 Stock Option Plan. On
October2, 2006, Catalyst stock option holders approved technical amendments to their stock option grants in anticipation of their assumption by LeCroy pursuant to the Catalyst Merger including, without limitation, amendments reflecting that
any stock option or other award granted thereunder would be exercisable for LeCroy common stock. Upon completion of the Merger, each outstanding stock option issued by Catalyst was assumed by LeCroy and was converted into an option to purchase that
number of shares of LeCroy common stock equal to the number of shares of Catalyst common stock purchasable pursuant to the Catalyst option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of LeCroy common stock. The exercise price per share was equal to the exercise price per share of Catalyst common stock divided by the exchange ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The Companys assumption
of the Catalyst issued options was treated as a modification of the terms of the original Catalyst grant. The same conversion formula was utilized 
83 Table of Contents
to calculate the number of assumed options as was used in the Merger consideration and, as such, the aggregate fair value of Catalysts awards immediately prior to the Merger was
substantially similar to the aggregate fair value of the LeCroy awards on the date of grant. The 2008 Plan provides for the
grant of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards. The purchase price of any option granted under the 2008 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of
grant. The aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be issued or transferred pursuant to options or restricted stock awards under the 2008 Plan is 2,800,000 shares. The 2008 Plan also allows for awards based on performance criteria which
awards may then qualify as performance- based compensation under Section162m of the Internal Revenue Code. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers the 2008 Plan and has the authority to determine the
terms of such options or awards including the number of shares, exercise or purchase prices and times at which the options become and remain exercisable or restricted stock is no longer restricted. In fiscal 2010, 9,000 options have been granted
under the 2008 Plan. There have been no performance-based awards granted under the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan expires on September22, 2015. 
Stock Options 
The fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are
calculated based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. Management monitors share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise
behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company analyzes its historical forfeiture rate, the remaining lives of unvested options and the amount of vested options as a percentage of total options outstanding. If the
Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the
current periods. The expected holding period of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a 5-year U.S. Treasury note in effect on the date
of the grant or such other period that most closely equals the expected term of the option. The table below presents the
assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the fiscal years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009, and June28, 2008:  Years Ended July3,2010

value of stock options exercised during each of the years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009, and June28, 2008 was approximately $01 million, $01 million, and $03 million, respectively. 
As of July3, 2010, there was approximately $14 million, of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related
to stock options granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 26 years. 
In fiscal 2010 there were approximately 121,000 of immediately vested options granted as part of the annual grant to non-employee
directors. The remaining shares issued to employees had vesting periods of four years. Non-Vested Stock 
The fair value of new grants is determined based on the closing price on the date of grant. Related compensation expense is recognized
ratably over the associated requisite service period, giving effect to estimated forfeitures. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future,
the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods. The

share. In fiscal 2010, immediately vested shares were granted to non-employee directors as part of the annual grant.
As of July3, 2010, there was approximately $07 million of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated
forfeitures related to non-vested stock granted under the plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 13 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP with a look-back option that allows employees to purchase shares of
common stock at 85% of the market value at the lower of either the date of enrollment or the date of purchase. Payment for the ESPP is a fixed amount, set at the beginning of the period, made through payroll withholding over the enrollment period of
six months. The number of shares the participant can acquire is variable based on the fixed amount withheld and the applicable fair value. Since the ESPP includes a purchase price discount of greater than 5% and a look-back option, it is considered
to be compensatory. The fair value of the put and call features of the estimated shares to be purchased are estimated at the beginning of the purchase period using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities
are calculated based on the historical six-month volatility of the Companys stock. The expected holding period is equal to the six-month enrollment period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the interest rate of a six-month U.S. Treasury
note in effect on the first day of the enrollment period. The fair value of the shares is liability classified until the end of the six-month period at which time the amount is then equity classified. As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009,
there is less than $01 million of liability classified share-based compensation expense for the ESPP included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The ESPP has reserved for issuance an aggregate of 1,860,000 shares of common stock and is set to expire on November30, 2015. In
fiscal 2010, 181,778 shares were issued under the ESPP. Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Rights 
On August20, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2007 Stock Appreciation Right Plan theSAR
Plan. Under the SAR Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may award stock appreciation rights to eligible employees. Each stock appreciation right SAR awarded represents the right to receive an amount of
cash equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the Companys common stock on the date that a participant exercises such right over the fair market value of a share of the Company common stock on the date that such SAR was
awarded. Awards of SARs will vest in four successive annual installments of 25% of the SARs subject to such award on the anniversary of the date of the grant of such award. The employee will have four years from the date of vesting of an installment
in which to exercise such installment. The SAR Plan will terminate on August20, 2017. The fair value of SARs granted is
estimated on the date of grant and remeasured at each reporting period using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatilities are calculated based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. Management monitors award
exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates. If the Companys actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate, or if the Company reevaluates the forfeiture rate in the future, the stock-based
compensation expense could be significantly different from what was recorded in the current periods. The expected holding period of SARs represents the period of time that SARs granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate is
based on the interest rate of a U.S. Treasury note in effect on the date of the remeasurement for such period closest to the expected term of the SARs. 
The Company records compensation expense ratably over the service period and adjusts for changes in the fair value of SARs at each
reporting period. At July3, 2010, there was approximately $32 million of unrecognized compensation cost net of estimated forfeitures related to SARs, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 24
years. The table below presents the assumptions used to remeasure the value of the SARs at each reporting period: July3,2010

403,215 Purchases under this buyback program may be made from time to time on the open market and in privately negotiated transactions, including
pursuant to the terms of a 10b5-1 plan. A 10b5-1 plan allows a company to purchase shares during a blackout period, provided the company communicates its share purchase instructions to the broker prior to the blackout period, pursuant to a written
plan that may not be changed. The timing of these purchases is dependent upon several factors, including market conditions, the market price of the Companys common stock, the effect of the share dilution on earnings, available cash and any
other potential risks the Company may encounter. The share repurchase plan may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Company. 
The terms of our New Credit Agreement prohibits the Company from repurchasing shares or paying dividends on LeCroys common stock
without the prior consent of lenders.

15.Net Loss Per Common Share EPS 
Basic net loss per common share is net loss divided by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the period. The following
is a presentation of the numerators and the denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per common share computations for the years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 in thousands: Years Ended June27,2009

Diluted net income per common share is calculated using the weighted average of common shares outstanding adjusted to include the effect of shares from the assumed
exercise of dilutive stock options, convertible debt, if dilutive, and non-vested stock using the treasury stock method and is not applicable due to the net loss in each period. 
The computations of diluted EPS for the years ended July3, 2010, June27, 2009 and June28, 2008 do not include
approximately 19million, 19million and 17million, respectively, of stock options and non-vested stock, as the effect of their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive to EPS. Additionally, the Convertible notes had no impact on
diluted EPS because the average share price during the fiscal years was below $1455 per share, the initial conversion price, and accordingly, the Convertible notes, if converted, would have required only cash at settlement. 
16.Stockholder Rights Plan 
On November2, 1998, the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one right in respect to each share of
LeCroys common stock outstanding at the record date, November18, 1998. The rights had been traded together with the common stock and were not exercisable or separately tradable. The rights were exercisable if a person or group acquired
15% or more of the Companys common stock or announced a tender offer. Right holders, other than the acquiring person or group, were then entitled to purchase an amount of the Companys common stock at a 50% discount to the share price at
that time. The number of shares of common stock that a right holder was entitled to purchase was based on the exercise price. Under certain circumstances, the right entitled the stockholder to buy shares in an acquiring entity at a discount.
The Board of Directors could have redeemed the rights at a price of $0001 per right up until 10 days following a public
announcement that any person or group had acquired 15% or more of LeCroys common stock. These rights have expired on November2, 2008, and no new plan has been implemented as of July3, 2010. The rights plan had no impact on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company. 17.Employee Benefit Plans 
Domestic Plan 
The Company has a discretionary employee 401k savings plan for eligible U.S. employees under which the Company contributes an
unconditional match of up to 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum employer contribution of 5% of the employees eligible compensation, as defined. Effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, as a result of the weakening economic
conditions, the Company temporarily suspended its 401k contribution 
88 Table of Contents
matching program in an effort to reduce costs. The Company will review its decision to reinstate the 401k match when economic conditions improve. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
expensed zero, approximately $03 million and $05 million, respectively, in matching contributions to this plan. 
International Plans 
Switzerland 
The Companys subsidiary in Switzerland sponsors a pension plan covering thirty-seven employees and seven former employees as of
July3, 2010. The plan requires employee contributions based upon a percentage of the employees earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 46% to 84%. The Company makes a matching contribution that is also based on a percentage of the
employees earnings, as defined, currently ranging from 54% to 96%. For fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company has made approximately $04 million, $05 million and $05 million, respectively, in matching contributions to this plan. As of
July3, 2010 expected employer contributions for fiscal 2011 are approximately $04million. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2010, the Company applied the provisions under defined benefit pension plan accounting to its Swiss plan, which was previously accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Under Swiss Law, there is a guaranteed minimum benefit requirement
which must be valued as a defined benefit obligation for U.S. GAAP purposes. The results did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations for each of the years presented. As of
July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, the Company had an accrued pension liability of less than $01 million which was recorded in Deferred revenue and other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Swiss plan was valued in accordance with the requirements under U.S. GAAP to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the
date of the Companys fiscal year end statement of financial position. According to the guidance for defined benefit
plans, the rate used to discount post-employment benefit obligations should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds, or suitable alternative means. In Switzerland, where there is a lack
of an active market in such bonds, the market yields at the balance sheet date of government bonds was used, plus a risk premium between 05% - 15%. The currency and term of the government bonds is consistent with the currency and estimated term of
the post-employment benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based on historical market returns
over long periods and expectations of future performance, utilizing the target asset allocations currently in place. The
assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations are as follows in percentages:  Years Ended July3,2010

The Company has a conservative investment strategy for plan assets. The actual and target allocations reflect a risk/return profile that
the Company feels is appropriate relative to the plans liability structure and return goals. The primary goal is to slightly exceed the minimum return on pension assets, as set forth by the Swiss Government on an annual basis.

This amount represents the mathematical reserve for former employees. Upon retirement, if the annuity option is chosen, the pension fund transfers this amount to an
insurance company to buy an annuity. The insurance contracts do not yield a return on assets and are stated at present value, which approximates fair value. As of July3, 2010 and June27, 2009, this amount was approximately $40 million.

Environmental 
The Companys former subsidiary, Digitech Industries, Inc. Digitech, was notified prior to 1999 by the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection the DEP that it may be responsible for environmental damage that occurred at its previously leased facilities in Ridgefield, Connecticut the Ridgefield Site. Based upon
recommendations made by the DEP, Digitech engaged environmental consultants to assist it in evaluating the costs associated with the DEPs recommendations for monitoring and remediation of the environmental damage. 
In May 1999, LeCroy, Digitech and the former owners of the Ridgefield Site entered into an agreement with the current owners of the
Ridgefield Site. The current owners purchased an insurance policy providing for $20 million of coverage against certain environmental liabilities related to the Ridgefield Site. That insurance policy names both LeCroy and Digitech as insured
parties. The current owners of the Ridgefield Site also agreed to remediate all environmental problems associated with the property and to obtain all applicable approvals and certifications from the DEP. The current owners of the Ridgefield Site
also agreed to hold both LeCroy and Digitech harmless in the event of a claim made against them relating to these environmental matters. In return for the above, forty-five days after the DEP has provided written notification to the Company that the
site remediation has been accomplished to its satisfaction, the Company agreed to pay the former owners of the Ridgefield Site $02 million as compensation for the reduced sale value of the property due to the environmental problems existing on the
site. In August 2000, the Company closed the sale of the assets and business of its Vigilant Networks, Inc. subsidiary Vigilant and a portion of the assets and business of its Digitech subsidiary. The Company has accrued retained
liabilities from discontinued operations of $02 million after the sale of the Vigilant business and the residual assets of Digitech, which amount is recorded in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the July3, 2010 and
June27, 2009 Consolidated Balance Sheets. Legal 
From time to time, the Company may be involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including but not limited to, patent,
commercial and environmental matters which arise in the ordinary course of business. There are no matters currently pending that the Company expects to have a material adverse affect on its business, results of operations, financial position or cash
flows. 20.Related Party Transactions 
On July19, 2005 the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a $03 million retention bonus to Mr.Reslewic.
This retention bonus requires Mr.Reslewic to remain an employee for five years. If 
93 Table of Contents
Mr.Reslewic terminates his employment earlier than five years, he will be required to repay the bonus in full. The retention bonus is being amortized over five years on a straight line
basis as compensation expense. At July3, 2010, almost zero of the retention bonus remains in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
In conjunction with the Catalyst acquisition, the Company issued a $35 million, 6% promissory note payable on January2, 2008, to
Nader Salehomoum, a former sole shareholder of Catalyst and former employee of the Company. In fiscal 2008, the note was fully repaid. 
21.Derivative Instruments and Fair Value 
Forward foreign exchange contracts 
The Company is exposed to global market exchange rate risks and, as a result, enters into forward exchange contracts to manage financial
exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency rates. These foreign currency forward exchange agreements are generally 30-day forward contracts, which are monitored and updated on a monthly basis, and used to reduce exposure to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Companys functional currencies. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. 
The Companys forward contracts are not accounted for as hedges. The Company records these agreements on the balance sheet at fair
value in Other current assets and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The changes in the fair value are recognized in Other, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 
The effect of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for years ended 2010 and 2009 are as follows in

a net gain of $03 million and a net loss of $06 million for the fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The U.S.

The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions inputs used
to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:  Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
94 Table of Contents Level 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or
quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.  Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting managements own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
As of July3, 2010, the fair values of the Companys financial assets and liabilities are
categorized as follows in thousands:  Total

The fair
values above were based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward currency prices. The net fair value of the open foreign exchange forward contracts is a net liability of less than $01 million at July3, 2010 as
compared to a net asset of approximately $01 million at June27, 2009. 22.Unaudited Quarterly Results of Operations

23. Subsequent Events 
On July29, 2010, LeCroy Corporation entered into an Amended and Restated $500 million Senior Secured Credit Agreement the
New Credit Agreement with the lenders listed therein and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as administrative agent for such lenders. The New Credit Agreement amends LeCroys existing credit facility that was entered into on
March30, 2007 and subsequently amended. The terms of the New Credit Agreement provide LeCroy with a $500 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $50 million swingline loan subfacility and a $50 million letter of credit
subfacility. LeCroy has the right to increase the total revolving commitment to $600 million within the first twenty-four months of the New Credit Agreement upon meeting certain conditions. The performance by LeCroy of its obligations under the New
Credit Agreement is secured by all of the assets of LeCroy and its domestic subsidiaries, and is guaranteed by LeCroys domestic subsidiaries. 
Subject to complying with applicable covenants, including a covenant which requires the Company to reduce its total debt outstanding to
$400 million by March31, 2011, excluding Notes with a repurchase date no earlier than June30, 2014, the proceeds of the borrowings under the New Credit Agreement have and will be used to refinance existing debt, including the ability to
retire the outstanding Notes which has a first put or redemption date in October 2011, fund short-term and long-term permanent working capital, for issuance of Letters of Credit and general corporate purposes. 
Borrowings under the Agreement except swing line loans will bear interest at variable rates equal to, at LeCroys election,
aa rate based on LIBOR or bBase Rate, as defined, plus a margin based on the total leverage ratio. Swing line loans will bear interest at the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, as defined. In addition, LeCroy must pay commitment
fees during the term of the New Credit Agreement at rates dependent on the Companys leverage ratio. The New Credit
Agreement contains, among other things, conditions precedent, affirmative and negative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default. Negative covenants include certain restrictions or limitations on, among other things, the
incurrence of indebtedness; pledges, liens and encumbrances; mergers and acquisitions; loans, advances and investments; sales of assets and sale leaseback arrangements; and restricted payments, including distributions, dividends, stock repurchases
and the repayment of the Convertible notes. The New Credit Agreement prohibits repayment of the Convertible notes until ithe total leverage ratio is less than 300 to 100, iiafter giving effect to the repurchase the total leverage
ratio is less than 300 to 100 and iiiLeCroy is in compliance with all of the terms and conditions in the New Credit Agreement prior to and after giving effect to the repurchase. 
The Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants, measured quarterly, including, as defined: a total leverage ratio, a
senior leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated EBITDA, a minimum fixed charge ratio, a maximum capital expenditure, a maximum debt outstanding and a minimum liquidity. The maximum debt outstanding covenant will be eliminated upon the repayment of
Notes, in full, or upon extension of the first repurchase date, which is no earlier than one hundred and eighty days after January1, 2014 and replaced by a minimum liquidity covenant. 
The New Credit Agreement will mature on January1, 2014. However, if a default or event of default exists or is continuing the
maturity date will become July15, 2011. At the time of expiration all outstanding amounts under the New Credit Agreement will be due and payable. Under certain conditions, the lending commitments under the New Credit Agreement may be
terminated by the lenders and amounts outstanding under the New Credit Agreement may be accelerated. The Company incurred
approximately $07 million of financing costs in connection with the New Credit Agreement which will be deferred and amortized, on a straight line basis, over the term of the New Credit Agreement, along with the remaining unamortized fees associated
with the Prior Credit Agreement of approximately $02 million.

There have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and
15d-15f under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended July3, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 
Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that management document and test the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting and include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K a report on managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. See Managements Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules
13a-15f and 15d-15f of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the guidelines established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Based on the results of this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July3, 2010.
