Notes to Consolidated Financial   23                    16        REPORT OF CERTIFIED INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TB Wood Corporation We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of TB Wood Corporation and
subsidiaries the Company as of December 27, 2002 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholder
equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated
financial statements of TB Wood Corporation as of December 28, 2001 and for
the two years then ended were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations. These auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements in their report dated February 8, 2002.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatements. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the 2002 consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TB Wood
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 27, 2002, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of TB Wood
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2001 and for the two years then
ended were audited by other auditors, who have ceased operation. As described in
Note 2, these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include
transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company
as of December 29, 2001 beginning of 52/53 week fiscal year ending December 27,
2002. Our audit procedures with respect to the disclosures in Note 2 with
respect to fiscal 2001 and 2000 included a agreeing the previously reported
net income to the previously issued consolidated financial statements and the
adjustments to reported net income representing amortization expense including
any related income tax effects recognized in those periods related to goodwill,
intangible assets that are no longer being amortized, deferred credits related
to an excess over cost, equity method goodwill, and changes in amortization
periods for intangible assets that continue to be amortized as a result of
initially applying SFAS No. 142 including related income tax effects to the
Company underlying records obtained from management, and b testing the
mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net income to reported
net income, and the related earnings-per-share amounts. In our opinion, the
disclosures for fiscal 2001 and 2000 in Note 2 are appropriate. However, we were
not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the fiscal 2001 and
2000 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to
such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other
forms of assurance on the fiscal 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements
as a whole.
We have also audited schedule II for the year ended December 27, 2002. In our
opinion, this schedule when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information therein.

Arthur Andersen LLP. This report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP in

as of December 29, 2000, the consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the
year ended December 31, 1999 and the information in the Schedule for 1999
referred to in this report have not been included in the accompany consolidated

Corporation a Delaware corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 28, 2001
and December 29, 2000 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 28, 2001. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of TB Wood Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 28, 2001 and December 29, 2000 and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended December 28, 2001 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.
Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule of valuation and qualifying
accounts listed in Item 14a 2 of this Form 10-K is presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to
be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole. ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP Atlanta, Georgia

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements
in thousands, except per share amounts
1. Nature of Business and Principles of Consolidation
TB Wood Corporation and subsidiaries collectively, Wood or the Company
is an established designer, manufacturer, and marketer of electronic and
mechanical industrial power transmission products which are sold to
distributors, domestic and international manufacturers, and users of industrial
equipment. Principal products of the Company include electronic drives,
integrated electronic drive systems, mechanical belted drives, and flexible
couplings. The Company has operations throughout the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Germany, Italy and India. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of TB Wood Corporation, its wholly owned
subsidiaries, and its majority-owned joint ventures. All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Year-End
The Company 52/53-week fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to the last day
of December. The Company fiscal year ends were as follows  27, 2002
28, 2001
29, 2000
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Product Warranty
In the ordinary course of business, the Company warrants its products against
defect in design, materials, and workmanship over various time periods. Warranty
reserve and allowance for product returns is established based upon management
best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on
products sold as of the balance sheet date. The warranty reserve and allowance
for product returns is immaterial to the financial position of the Company for
all periods presented and the change in reserve and allowance for each period is
immaterial to the Company results and cash flow.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market primarily using the
last-in, first-out LIFO method. Market is defined as net realizable value.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead.
Approximately 66% and 72% of total inventories at December 27, 2002 and December
28, 2001, respectively, were valued using the LIFO method. In 2001, the Company
changed its method for determining LIFO values from the double-extension method
to the link-chain method. This change did not have a material impact upon the
financial statements. Due to the decline in inventories valued using the LIFO
method, the LIFO reserve decreased $278 and $451 during the years ended December
27, 2002 and December 28, 2001 respectively, which reduced the Cost of Goods
Sold by the same amount. Inventories for foreign operations are stated at the
lower of cost or market using the first-in, first-out FIFO method.
The Company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable
inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.                    23 Property, Plant and Equipment
The Company depreciates its property, plant, and equipment principally using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Equipment
under capital leases is depreciated over the asset estimated useful life and
is included in machinery and equipment. Maintenance and repair costs are charged
to expense as incurred, while major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related
carrying value and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and
any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. The depreciable lives of the
major classes of property, plant and equipment are summarized as follows   
Asset Type              Lives
Machinery and equipment         3 - 15 years
Buildings and improvements        10 - 40 years
Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the expected future net cash
flows generated by the assets. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds its fair value.
Post Retirement Benefits Obligation
The Company in consultation with an actuarial firm specializing in the valuation
of postretirement benefit obligations selects certain actuarial assumptions to
base the actuarial valuation of such obligation on, such as the discount rate
interest rate used to determine present value of obligations payable in the
future, initial health care cost trend rate, the ultimate cost care trend rate
and mortality tables to determine the expected future mortality of plan
participants. To the extent that the actual rates and mortality vary from the
assumptions used to determine the present actuarial valuation of these
postretirement benefits, additional provision for expense may be necessary.
Stock Based Compensation
For fiscal 2002 and prior years the Company used the intrinsic value method as
defined by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 to account for stock-based
employee compensation in each period presented. The Company intends to adopt
SFAS No. 123 as amended by SFAS No. 148 during fiscal 2003 but has not yet made
a determination as to the transition method to use or completed the valuation of
the options granted during January 2003.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and net income
loss per share had compensation costs for the stock-based compensation plan
been determined based on the grant date fair values of awards under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, for the fiscal years                                             2002     2001     2000
Net loss income as reported                             $1,050   $2,906    $6,145

As reported                                    $020    $054    $112
Pro forma                                     $023    $054    $112 Revenue Recognition
The Company revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements issued
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Revenue is recognized at the time
product is shipped and title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with
the customer, the amount due from the customer is fixed and collectibility of
the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Company establishes allowances
to cover anticipated doubtful accounts, sales discounts, product warranty, and
returns based upon historical experience. Shipping and handling costs charged to
customers are included as a component of net sales.                    24 Self-Insurance
For a portion of fiscal 2000 and prior fiscal years the Company workers'
compensation insurance policies had the potential for retrospective premium
adjustments. In fiscal 2000 the Company changed to a fully insured workers'
compensation insurance type of policy. For fiscal 2001 and prior years the
Company maintained a partially self-insured group health insurance policy that
is subject to specific retention levels. During fiscal 2002 the Company changed
to a fully insured group health insurance policy. Insurance administrators
assist the Company in estimating the fully developed workers' compensation
liability and group health insurance reserves that are accrued by the Company.
In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for all incurred
claims. At December 27, 2002, the Company bank had issued letters of credit
totaling $577 to cover incurred but unpaid claims and other costs related to its
workers' compensation liability.
Foreign Currency Translation
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiaries have been
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation.
Translation adjustments, which result from the process of translating financial
statements into U.S. dollars, are accumulated as a separate component of other
comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency
transactions, primarily intercompany sales of products, are included in other
expense in the accompanying statements of operations.
Goodwill
For fiscal 2001 and prior years the excess of cost over the net assets acquired
Goodwill was amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 40 years.
Goodwill amortization before income taxes for 2001 and 2000 was $226 and $259
respectively.
Effective at the beginning of its fiscal year 2002 the Company adopted Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets which requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an
indefinite life will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual
impairment test. As a result of adopting SFAS No. 142, the Company will no
longer record goodwill amortization of approximately $226 $180 after income
tax per year.
The following table provides the comparable effects of the adoption of SFAS No.
142 for the fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000. in thousands, except per share data                        2002     2001     2000

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company performed its first annual
impairment tests that indicated impairment of goodwill of the North American
Electronics reporting unit. As a result the second phase of the tests required
by SFAS No. 142 on a fair value approach for the North American Electronics
reporting unit was performed. This second phase of the impairment evaluation
determined that impairment had occurred, as a result of which an impairment loss
of $4,453 $2,846 net of income taxes, was recognized as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 as
prescribed by SFAS No. 142.
25 Reconciliation of the Goodwill account is as follows                                         
Goodwill, balance at December 29, 2000                 $9,546

Shareholders' Equity
Since 1996, the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to purchase up to
a total of 500,000 of the Company common shares subject to certain business
and market conditions. As of December 27, 2002 the number of treasury shares
purchased under this authorization was 497,936 excluding shares issued to
employees. This total includes 150,003 shares accepted on August 3, 2001 at
$1100 per share plus related costs under the self-tender offer authorized by
the Board of Directors in 2001 and 50,000 shares purchased on September 7, 2001
at $1100 per share that were retired. In addition in 1999, the Board of
Directors authorized a self-tender offer for the Company common shares under
which on December 17, 1999, the Company accepted 400,000 shares at $900 per
share plus related costs. During 2002, the Company transferred 10,310 shares of
treasury stock to the employees stock purchase plan and 11,112 to the 401k
profit-sharing plan.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or
liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable, approximate carrying value due to the short-term maturity of
the instruments. The fair value of short-term and long-term debt amounts
approximate carrying value and are based on their effective interest rates
compared to current market rates.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Research and Development Cost
Research and development costs consist substantially of projects related to new
product development within the electronics business and are expensed as
incurred. Total research and development costs were $2,879 in 2002, $3,077 in
2001, and $3,108 in 2000.
Major Customers
The Company five largest customers accounted for approximately 40%, 36%, and
31% of net sales for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively. Of these
customers, one accounted for close to 25% of net sales for the year ended
December 27, 2002. The loss of one or more of these customers would have an
adverse effect on the Company performance and operations. Foreign and export
sales accounted for 25%, 23% and 25% of total sales in fiscal years 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively.
Net Income Per Share
Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing reported earnings
available to common shareholders by weighted average shares outstanding. No
dilution for any potentially dilutive securities is included in basic EPS.
Diluted EPS is computed by dividing reported earnings available to common
shareholders by weighted average shares and common equivalent shares
outstanding.
26 The computation of weighted average shares outstanding is as follows for fiscal
years 2002, 2001, and 2000                                         2002      2001      2000
Common shares outstanding for basic EPS                     5,232      5,332      5,468
Shares issued upon assumed exercise of outstanding
stock options                                 --       23        5
Weighted average number of common and common
equivalent shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share        5,232      5,355      5,473
Options outstanding for 783,000, 676,250 and 623,100 shares for fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively, are excluded from the calculation of weighted
average shares outstanding because they are anti-dilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 141 Business
Combinations that was effective July 2001 which requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the
purchase method. The Company has made no acquisitions since the effective date
of this statement. Also in July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets effective for the Company at the beginning of its
fiscal year 2002. The effect of adopting this accounting standard is detailed in
the Goodwill section above.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated
asset retirement costs. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2002. The Company intends to adopt this statement effective
December 28, 2002 beginning of the Company fiscal 2003. The Company does not
believe that implementation of this SFAS will have a material impact on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.
In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets, which
supercedes SFAS No. 121. Though it retains the basic requirements of SFAS No.
121 regarding when and how to measure impairment loss, SFAS No. 144 provides
additional implementation guidance. SFAS No. 144 applies to long-lived assets to
be held and used or to be disposed of, including assets under capital leases of
lessees; assets subject to operating leases of lessors; and prepaid assets. This
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The
Company adoption of this SFAS during fiscal 2002 has not had a material impact
on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 145
Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No
13, and Technical Corrections. SFAS No. 145 rescinds previous accounting
guidance, which required all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be
classified as an extraordinary item. Under SFAS No. 145 classification of debt
extinguishment depends on the facts and circumstances of the transaction. This
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The
Company does not expect this SFAS to have a material impact upon the
Consolidated Financial Statements upon its adoption during fiscal 2003.
In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 146
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS No. 146
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the costs associated with exit
or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition
for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity
Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. This statement is
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The
Company does not believe that the adoption of this SFAS during fiscal 2003 will
have a material impact upon the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards No. 148
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation--Transition and Disclosure, an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. The Company intends to adopt SFAS No. 123
as amended by SFAS No. 148 to account for options granted under its 1996 Stock
Based Incentive Compensation Plan during fiscal 2003. The Company is evaluating
the transition methods allowed under this standard. Accordingly the Company
cannot determine the impact of adoption of this SFAS at this time.                    27

The Company has a $52,500 unsecured revolving credit facility with PNC Bank,
N.A. For a portion of 2001 $10,000 of the total was payable in German
deutschemarks. During 2001, the Company converted the German deutschemark
portion into a US dollar denominated amount. In addition to the $18,100 actually
borrowed under this facility at December 27, 2002, there were letters of credit
outstanding in the amount of $5,995 primarily to secure the Company industrial
revenue bonds. The amount available at December 27, 2002 was $28,455. The
revolving credit bears a variable interest of LIBOR at December 27, 2002 plus
1375%, and matures in October 2003. The average rate of the revolving debt at
December 27, 2002 and December 28, 2001 was 283% and 323% respectively. The
credit facility contains numerous restrictive financial covenants which require
the Company to comply with certain financial tests including, among other
things, maintaining minimum tangible net worth, as defined, and maintaining
certain specified ratios. The credit facility also contains other restrictive
covenants that include, among other things, restrictions on outside investments
and restrictions on capital expenditures. The Company was in compliance with
amended debt covenants as of the end of its fiscal year.
In addition to the above facility, one of the Company foreign subsidiaries has
an unsecured revolving credit facility denominated in Euro that translates
into $193 at December 27, 2002, maturing in 2003. The rate for this facility was
38% at December 27, 2002.
The gross proceeds from repayments of the revolving credit facilities are as
follows  
2002        2001        2000

28 In August 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that
effectively converted $10,000 of the underlying variable rate debt in the
unsecured PNC revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt. The notional
principal amount of the swap agreement is $10,000 with an effective fixed rate
of 575%. The swap agreement was settled each month and expired in July 2001.
The Company did not renew or reestablish a similar interest swap agreement.
In April 1997, the Company borrowed approximately $23 million by issuing
Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Industrial Revenue
Board of the City of Chattanooga, bearing variable interest as set by the
Industrial Revenue Board of the City of Chattanooga 17% at December 27, 2002
maturing April 2022. The bonds were issued to finance a new production facility
for the electronics systems business.
In February 1999, the Company borrowed approximately $30 million by issuing
Variable Rate Demand Revenue Bonds under the authority of the Industrial
Development Corporation City of San Marcos, bearing variable interest as set by
the Industrial Development Corporation City of San Marcos 17% at December 27,
2002, maturing April 2024. The bonds were issued to finance a new production
facility for the mechanical division.

Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities at the end of each period
are determined by applying the current tax rate to temporary difference between
the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The components of deferred income taxes at December 27, 2002 and December 28,
2001 are as follows                                      2002        2001

29 The provision for income taxes in fiscal 2001 includes a tax benefit related to
revised estimates of the Company income tax liability and the realization of
certain state income tax refunds of approximately $519 as well as certain income
tax credits.
In 2002, 2001, and 2000 earnings before income taxes included $206, $1,151,
and $3,096, respectively, of losses or earnings generated by the Company
foreign operations. No federal or state income taxes benefit or provision has
been provided on the undistributed earnings of certain of these foreign
operations, as the earnings will continue to be reinvested. It is not practical
to estimate the additional income taxes, including any foreign withholding taxes
that might be payable with the eventual remittance of such earnings.
6. Benefit Plan
Compensation Plans
The Company maintains a discretionary compensation plan for its salaried and
hourly employees, which provides for incentive awards based on certain levels of
earnings, as defined. Amounts awarded under the plan and charged to expense in
the accompanying statements of operations were $0, $0, and $759 for fiscal years
2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively.
Profit-Sharing Plans
Since January 1, 1988, the Company has maintained a separate defined
contribution 401k profit-sharing plan covering substantially all United States
employees. Under this plan, the Company matches a specified percentage of each
eligible employee contribution and 50% of the match is invested in funds
designated by the employee. The Company suspended the matching portion of this
plan from March 1, 2002 until July 31, 2002. The Company contributed 11,112
shares of common stock held in treasury in 2002, 23,630 shares in 2001, and
33,587 shares in 2000. The Company also contributed cash to this profit-sharing
plan of approximately $230, $570, and $452 for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000
respectively. In addition, the Company has a noncontributory profit-sharing plan
covering its Canadian employees for which $55, $70, and $12 was charged to
expense for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP enables employees of the
Company to subscribe for shares of common stock on quarterly offering dates, at
a purchase price which is the lesser of 85% effective September 2001 or 90% for
prior periods of the fair value of the shares on the first or last day of the
quarterly period. Employee contributions to the ESPP were $61, $78, and $103 for
2002, 2001, and 2000 respectively. Pursuant to the ESPP, 10,310 shares were
issued to employees during 2002, 12,194 during 2001, and 13,324 during 2000. At
the annual meeting on April 11, 1997, the Company shareholders approved the
reservation of 500,000 shares to be issued under the ESPP. As of December 27,
2002, 438,505 shares are available for future issuance.
Stock Options
The Company has a 1996 stock-based incentive compensation plan the 1996
Plan, the purpose of which is to assist the Company in attracting and
retaining valued personnel by offering them a greater stake in the Company
success and a closer identity with the Company, and to encourage ownership of
the Company common stock by such personnel.
The 1996 Plan is administered by a committee the Committee designated by the
board of directors. Awards under the 1996 Plan may be made to all officers and
key employees of the Company. No awards can be made under the 1996 Plan after
January 31, 2006.
The Committee may grant stock options and shares of common stock in the form of
either deferred stock or restricted stock, as defined in the 1996 Plan. Options
granted under the 1996 Plan may be either incentive stock options ISOs or
nonqualified stock options. ISOs are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Unless
an option is specifically designated at the time of grant as an ISO, options
under the 1996 Plan will be nonqualified. The Committee will determine the
exercise price of the options. The maximum term of an option or Stock
Appreciation Right SAR granted under the 1996 Plan shall not exceed ten
years from the date of grant or five years from the date of grant if the
recipient on the date of grant owns, directly or indirectly, shares possessing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
Company. No option or SAR may be exercisable sooner than six months from the
date the option or SAR is granted.                    30 Stock option activity for the fiscal years 2002, 2001, 2000 is as follows                                  Number of shares   Weighted average

As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the
Company continues to measure compensation cost for those plans using the method
of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25,
Accounting for Stock Issued To Employees. Under this opinion the Company did
not recognize any compensation expense from such grants because the exercise
price of the options equaled or exceeded the market price on the date of grant.
SFAS No. 123 does, however, require the disclosure of pro forma net income and
earnings per share, as if the fair value-based method of accounting had been
applied.
The Company has calculated the fair value of its stock-based compensation plan
under SFAS No. 123 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 2002, 2001, and 2000                             2002        2001        2000

method was $153, $24, and $57, respectively net of tax, which would be
recognized as expense over the vesting period of the options.
Postretirement Benefits
The Company sponsors an unfunded defined benefit postretirement medical plan
that provides coverage for retirees and their dependents. A portion of the plan
is paid for by retiree cost sharing. The accounting for the plan anticipates
future cost sharing increases to keep pace with health care inflation.
In fiscal 2001 the Company terminated post retirement medical plan benefits for
all employees retiring subsequent to December 31, 2001. While employees retiring
after December 31, 2001 will be allowed to participate in the insured medical
plan, these employees will pay 102% of the cost of the monthly insurance premium
to the Company for such class of employees. As a result of the curtailment of                    31 these postretirement plan benefits, the Company realized a gain in 2001 in the
amount of $482. During fiscal 2001, the Company also recorded a reduction in the
postretirement benefit obligation of $788 as a result of revised actuarial
estimates.
The following table summarizes the Company postretirement benefit obligations
and the assumptions used in determining postretirement benefit cost                                 2002        2001

A one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase
the aggregate of the service and interest components of the net benefit for the
year ended December 27, 2002 by $15 and the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of that date by $251. A one percent decrease in the assumed health
care cost trend rate would decrease the aggregate of the service and interest
components of the net benefit for the year ended December 27, 2002 by $13 and
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of that date by $219.
7. Commitments And Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. In management opinion, the ultimate resolution of these
actions will not materially affect the Company financial position or results
of operations.
Capital Expenditure Commitments
The amount of commitments for capital expenditures at December 27, 2002 was
immaterial.
Environmental Risks
The Company operations and properties are subject to federal, state, and local
laws, regulations, and ordinances relating to certain materials, substances, and
wastes. The nature of the Company operations exposes it to the risk of claims
with respect to environmental matters. Based on the Company experience to
date, management believes that the future cost of compliance with existing
environmental requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company operations or financial position.
32 Operating Lease Commitments
The Company leases warehouse and office space, office equipment, and other items
under non-cancelable operating leases. The expense for non-cancelable operating
leases was approximately $1,319, $468, and $457 for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and
2000 respectively. At December 27, 2002, future minimum lease payments under
non-cancelable operating leases are as follows        2003                   $1,360
2004                   1,073
2005                    836
2006                    457
2007                    314
2008 and thereafter             247
$4,287
8. Joint Ventures
In July 1999, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with The
Electron Corp. Electron to manufacture, machine, market, distribute, and
engineer belted drive components and such other products having similar uses
which may be developed by the Company or Electron in the future. The Company
since the formation of the joint venture held controlling interest and, as such,
has consolidated the joint venture.
In November 2001 Electron filed for reorganization under Chapter 11
Reorganization of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Subsequently in March of 2002 this
filing was converted into a filing under Chapter 7 Liquidation of the Code. In
July 2002, the Company purchased Electron interest in the joint venture from a
bank that succeeded to that interest as a secured creditor. Following the
purchase of Electron interest, the joint venture dissolved and the Company
succeeded to their business and assets. The Company did not suffer any losses as
a result of this event nor did it have a material impact upon the business.
Operating income attributed to the joint venture with Electron for the year
ending December 27, 2002 and from its inception through the year ending December
27, 2002 was $691 and $15,282, respectively. Electron share of these amounts
was $162 and $3,504, respectively. During 2002 and 2001 distributions were made
to Electron in the amounts of $28 and $376, respectively.
9. Business Segment Information
Description of the Types of Products from which each Segment Derives its
Revenues
The Company is engaged principally in the design, manufacture, and sale of
industrial power transmission products. The products manufactured by the Company
are classified into two segments, mechanical business and electronics business.
The mechanical business segment includes belted drives, couplings, gear motors
and gearboxes. The electronics business segment includes electronic drives and
electric drive systems. Products of these segments are sold to distributors,
original equipment manufacturers, and end users for manufacturing and commercial
applications.
Measurement of Segment Profit or Loss and Segment Assets
The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based on profit or
loss from operations before income taxes. The accounting policies of the
reportable segments are the same as described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. Inter-segment sales are not material.
Factors Management Used to Identify the Company Reportable Segments
The Company reportable segments are business units that manufacture and market
separate and distinct products and are managed separately because each business
requires different processes, technologies, and market strategies.
The following table summarizes revenues, operating income, total assets and
expenditures for long-lived assets by business segment for fiscal years 2002,
2001, and 2000                    33                                 2002        2001        2000
