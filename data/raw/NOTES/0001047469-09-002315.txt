SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     Note1. Nature of Business 
Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc., or the Company, is a multinational diversified producer of premium specialty papers headquartered in
the United States of America and is the world largest supplier of fine papers to the tobacco industry. The Company manufactures and sells paper and reconstituted tobacco products to the tobacco
industry as well as specialized paper products for use in other applications. Tobacco industry products comprised approximately 90percent of the Company consolidated net sales in each of the
years 2006 through 2008. The primary products in the group include Cigarette Papers, used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco leaf, or RTL, which is used as a blend with virgin
tobacco in cigarettes and reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for machine-made cigars. These products are sold directly to the major tobacco companies or their designated converters
in the Americas, Europe, Asia and elsewhere. Non-tobacco industry products are a diverse mix of products, certain of which represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine
operations. 
The
Company is a manufacturer of high porosity papers, which are used in manufacturing ventilated cigarettes, banded papers for the production of lower ignition propensity, or LIP, cigarettes and the
leading independent producer of RTL used in producing blended cigarettes. The Company conducts business in over 90 countries and currently operates 11 production locations worldwide, with mills in the
United States, France, the Philippines, Indonesia and Brazil. The Company also has a 50percent equity interest in a paper mill in China. 
The
Company manufacturing facilities have a long history of producing paper dating back to 1545. The Company domestic mills led the development of the North American tobacco-related papers
manufacturing industry, which was originated by Peter J. Schweitzer,Inc. that began as an importer of cigarette papers from France in 1908. 
As
used in this 2008 Annual report on Form10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, references to we, us, our, SWM, Schweitzer-Mauduit or similar terms include
Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
Note2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Presentation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S.GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable, based upon currently available facts and
known circumstances. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this report and in its other public
filings from time to time. 
Principles of Consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Minority
interest represents minority stockholders' 
53 
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued proportionate
share of the equity in SWM-B, the Company Brazilian paper operations, and LTRI, the Company French RTL operations. In January 2008, the Company acquired the minority
interest in LTRI, and now owns 100percent of LTRI see Note16, Acquisition. The Company share of the net loss of its 50percent owned joint venture in China is included in
the consolidated statements of income loss as loss from equity affiliates. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The Company did not have any special purpose
entities during 2008, 2007 or 2006. 
In
July 2005, the Company formed a joint venture with China National Tobacco Corporation, or CNTC, to produce tobacco-related papers in China. CNTC is the principal operating company under China
State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. CNTC and SM-China each own 50percent of the joint venture. The Company uses the equity method to account for this joint venture see
Note7, Joint Venture with CNTC. Investment in equity affiliates represents the Company investment in its China joint venture. 
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes revenue and the related accounts receivable when the following 4 criteria are met: 1persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists; 2ownership has transferred to the customer; 3the selling price is fixed or determinable; and 4collectibility is reasonably assured based on the
Company judgment regarding the collectibility of its accounts receivable. Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when it ships its manufactured product and title and risk of loss passes to its
customer in accordance with the terms of sale of the product. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated f.o.b., or free on board, shipping point. For sales transactions
designated f.o.b. destination, revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer delivery site, at which time title and risk of loss are transferred. Provisions for discounts,
returns, allowances, customer rebates and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related revenue is recorded. Deferred revenue represents advance payments from customers which are
earned based upon a mutually agreed-upon amount per unit of future product sales. 
Freight Costs  The cost of delivering finished goods to the Company customers is recorded as a component of cost of products sold. Those costs include the amounts
paid to a third party to deliver the finished goods. Any freight costs billed to and paid by a customer are included in revenue. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the periods in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No52, Foreign Currency Translation. The balance sheets of these entities are translated
at period-end exchange rates, and the differences from historical exchange rates are reflected in a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as unrealized
foreign currency translation adjustments. 
Foreign
currency risks arise from transactions and balances denominated in non-local currencies. Losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of such transactions and balances,
included in other expense, net, were $40million, $11million and $13million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
Derivative Instruments  As a multinational entity, the Company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Company
utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks, including where considered appropriate, derivative instruments. The Company uses derivative instruments 
54 
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued only
for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation. All derivative instruments the Company uses are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in
order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties. As of December31, 2008, the Company had $38million of its variable-rate long-term debt
fixed under interest rate swap agreements. Usually the contracts extend for no more than 12months, although their contractual term has been as long as 24months. The Company believes
the credit risks with respect to the counterparties, and the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged if the counterparties fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, are not
material in view of its understanding of the financial strength of the counterparties. 
Gains
and losses on instruments that hedge firm commitments are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying hedged items. Premiums paid for options are amortized ratably over the life of the
option. All other hedging gains and losses are included in period income or expense based on the period-end market price of the instrument. 
The
Company had outstanding forward contracts, which were held for purposes other than trading, maturing at various dates in 2008, 2009 and 2010, to purchase approximately $42million and
$16million of various foreign currencies at December31, 2008 and December31, 2007, respectively. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency
transactions to fix the Company local currency cash flow. These contracts had not given rise to any significant net deferred gains or losses as of December31, 2008 and December31,
2007, and their fair values approximated their carrying value. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid, unrestricted investments with remaining maturities of 3months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, goodwill and non-amortizable
intangible assets, when events and circumstances warrant a review. Goodwill is also tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. Goodwill is evaluated using a two-step test at
the reporting unit level. The first step compares the book value of the reporting unit to its fair value. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform the second step. In
the second step, we determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill. The
difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill. Any impairment loss
is measured as the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, no goodwill impairment charges
resulted from our required annual impairment tests. 
The
carrying value of long-lived assets is reviewed periodically to determine if events or circumstances have changed which may indicate that the assets may be impaired or the useful life
may need to be changed. The Company considers internal and external factors relating to each asset, including expectation of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and its plans with respect to
the operations. An impairment loss is measured by the amount the estimated fair value of the asset exceeds its net carrying value.  Environmental Spending 
Environmental spending is capitalized if such spending qualifies as property, plant and equipment, substantially increases the economic value or
extends the useful life of an asset. All other such spending is expensed as incurred, including fines and penalties incurred in connection with environmental violations. 
55 
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued Environmental
spending relating to an existing condition caused by past operations is expensed. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments are probable, and the costs can be reasonably
estimated. Generally, timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action. 
Capitalized Software Costs 
The Company capitalizes certain purchases of software and software development and installation costs in connection with major projects of software
development for internal use. These costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
not to exceed 7years. Costs associated with business process redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.
Amortization of capitalized software was $38million, $24million and $27million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Accumulated
amortization of capitalized software costs was $334million and $317million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
Business Tax Credits 
Business tax credits represent value added tax credits receivable and similar assets, such as Imposto sobre Circulao
de Mercadorias e Servios, or ICMS, in Brazil. Business tax credits are generated when value-added taxes, or VAT, are paid on purchases. VAT and similar taxes are collected from
customers on certain sales. In some jurisdictions, export sales do not require VAT tax collection. The Company currently expects the business tax credits recorded at December31, 2008, to be
fully recoverable. 
Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. In accordance with SFAS No109, deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Income tax expense benefit is the tax payable or refundable for the
period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not
to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, the Company considers estimates of future taxable income. 
In
connection with income tax assessments or unrecognized tax benefits, the Company classifies penalties as provision for income taxes and interest as interest expense in its consolidated statements
of income loss. 
The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. Federal and several state jurisdictions as well as in many foreign jurisdictions. With certain exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S.
Federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations for years before 2004. In France, SMF and its subsidiaries forma consolidated income tax group, and SMH and SMI forma
separate consolidated income tax group, while LTRI has separately filed its own income tax return. Following a legal reorganization during 2008, LTRI joined the SMF tax group effective
January1, 2009.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Accounting 
The Company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees' pension and other postretirement benefits over their approximate period of
service in accordance with SFAS No87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No106, Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions. The Company earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to these benefits, which primarily
consist of U.S. and French pension benefits and U.S. other postretirement benefits, or OPEBs. Each year recorded expenses are estimates based on actuarial calculations of the Company accumulated
and projected benefit obligations, or PBOs, for the Company various plans. 
Suspension
of additional benefits for future service is considered a curtailment under SFAS No88, Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined
Benefit Pension Plans for Termination Benefits, and if material, necessitates a remeasurement of plan assets and PBO. As part of a remeasurement, the Company adjusts its
discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, such as retirement, turnover and mortality table assumptions, as appropriate. The
Company recognized the unfunded status of its postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the PBO and plan assets at fair value, in its consolidated balance sheet as of
December31, 2006 upon its adoption of SFAS No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss, as well as charges and credits directly to stockholders' equity, which are excluded from net
income loss. The Company has presented comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss. 
Components
of accumulated other comprehensive income loss were as follows dollars in millions: December31, 2008

Common Stock purchased for treasury is recorded at cost. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such
stock on the weighted-average cost basis. 
Employee Stock Options 
The Company calculates stock option expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123
revised 2004, Share Based Payment, or SFAS No123R. Stock options have not been granted since 2005 and are not expected to be utilized by the Company in the future. A
summary of the status of stock options outstanding as of December31, 2008 and changes during the 3years then ended is presented in Note14, Stockholders' Equity. 
Restricted Stock 
The Company restricted stock grants generally vest upon completion of a specified period of time. The fair value of each award is equal to the
share price of the Company stock on the date of the grant as defined in SFAS No123R. This cost is recognized over the vesting period of the respective award. As of December31, 2008,
there was $08million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding restricted stock awards, the balance for which is included as an offset to additional
paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheet. A summary of outstanding restricted stock awards as of December31, 2008 and 2007 is included in Note14,
Stockholders' Equity. 
Restricted Stock Plan Performance Based Shares 
The Company Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, for key executives includes an equity-based award component that is provided through its
Restricted Stock Plan, or RSP. The objectives under the LTIP are established for multiple years at the beginning of a performance cycle and are intended to focus management on longer-term
strategic goals. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors designates participants in the LTIP and RSP and determines the equity-based award opportunity in the form of restricted stock for
each performance cycle, which is generally measured on the basis of a 2 or 3-year performance period. Performance is measured on a cumulative basis and a portion of each performance
cycle restricted stock award opportunity may be earned annually. The restricted shares are issued and outstanding when the number of shares becomes fixed, after the annual performance is

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued determined,
and such awards vest at the end of the performance cycle. The Company recognizes compensation expense with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in-capital over
the performance period based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, with compensation expense being adjusted cumulatively based on the number of shares expected to be earned according to
the level of achievement of performance goals. 
Fair Value Option  The Company has elected not to measure any of its financial instruments or certain commitments at fair value in accordance with SFAS No159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of SFAS No115.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
Effective January1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions related to financial assets and liabilities of Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No157 defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Adoption of SFAS No157
related to financial assets and liabilities on January1, 2008 had no effect on the Company consolidated financial position. The provisions of SFAS No157 related to
non-financial assets and liabilities will become effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No157
related to non-financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141R, which is a revision of SFAS No141, Business Combinations. SFAS No141R
applies prospectively to business combinations after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008. The objective of SFAS No141R is to
improve the reporting requirements of business combinations and their effects. To accomplish this, SFAS No141R establishes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer:
arecognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, brecognizes and measures
goodwill in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and cdetermines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. The impact of this standard on the Company consolidated financial statements will depend on the nature, terms and size of acquisitions entered into on
or after January1, 2009. 
During
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin No51,Consolidated Financial Statements, effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning on or after December15, 2008. The objective of SFAS No160 is to improve the reporting requirements for noncontrolling or minority interests by requiring: athe

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an
amendment of SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No161 is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning on or after November15, 2008. SFAS No161 changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are required to
provide enhanced disclosures about ahow and why an
entity uses derivative instruments, bhow derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under SFAS No133 and chow derivative instruments and related
hedged items affect an entity financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No161.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost using the First-In, First-Out, or FIFO, and weighted average methods, or market.
The Company inventoriable costs primarily include pulp, chemicals, direct labor, utilities, maintenance, depreciation, finishing supplies and an allocation of mill overhead costs. Machine
start-up costs or abnormal machine shut downs are expensed in the period incurred and are not inventoried. The definition of market value, with respect to all inventories, is replacement
cost or net realizable value. The Company reviews inventories at least quarterly to determine the necessity of write-offs for excess, obsolete or unsaleable inventory. The Company
estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization. These reviews require the Company to assess customer and market demand. At December31,
2008 and 2007, the Company had inventory reserves of $52million and $59million, respectively.

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Interest is capitalized as a component of the cost of construction
for large projects. Expenditures for betterments are capitalized whereas normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Property, other than land, is depreciated on the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. When property is sold or retired, the cost of the property and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance
sheet, and any gain or loss on the transaction is normally included in cost of products sold.

As
of December31, 2008, management determined the recent and projected losses at its Malaucene facility in France and the shut-down of a paper machine at PdM constituted events
requiring tests be performed for the recoverability of these long-lived assets. Based on analyses of the net book values and the fair market values, the Company French segment recorded
pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges totaling $135million, of which $59million was for buildings and improvements and $76million was for machinery
and equipment. In 2008, the company also recognized $05million in impairment charges for buildings at its Lee Mills in Lee, Massachusetts due to lower estimated fair value as of
December31, 2008. Fair values were estimated using discounted cash flows, market values or salvage value depending on the asset. These impairment charges are presented in restructuring and
impairment expense on the consolidated statements of income loss.

liabilities were classified within accrued expenses in each of the December31, 2008 and December31, 2007 consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the restructuring
liabilities during 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows dollars in millions: 2008

July1, 2008, the Company announced the exit of the coated papers business in the Brazilian market and a resulting decrease of approximately 100 employees, or 16percent, of the
current workforce in Brazil, both effective July 2008. These actions resulted in $13million of severance and other employee related costs during the third quarter of 2008 and
$19million of asset impairment charges during the second quarter of 2008. 
In
October 2007, the Company initiated a 3-part restructuring plan to reduce production capacity for tobacco-related papers in both France and the United States as well as to reduce
employment levels in Brazil. The 3-part plan included the expected idling of a base tipping paper machine at Papeteries de MalaucneS.A.S., or PdMal, in
Malaucne, France and the shutdown of the Company entire operation in Lee, Massachusetts which began in May 2008 and has been completed. The PdMal base tipping paper machine was
originally projected to be shutdown in 2008, but this has been postponed pending ongoing customer qualifications. The Company is in the process of transferring production from the Lee Mills to other
facilities, primarily in Brazil, and has discontinued the sale of the majority of commercial and industrial papers formerly produced at the Lee Mills. 
As
a result of these restructuring actions, including the latest action in Brazil announced July1, 2008, employment at the affected locations decreased by approximately 800 employees, over
20percent from 2006 levels. The announced restructuring activities were substantially completed during 2008, except for the postponed shutdown of the PdMal base tipping paper machine which has
been delayed pending ongoing customer negotiations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
As
of December31, 2008, the Company had availability under its Credit Agreement, of $697million plus availability under bank overdraft facilities of
$121million for a total availability of $818million; however, based on its debt covenant restrictions as of December31, 2008, the Company was limited to borrowing only
$765million from its Credit Agreement, bank overdraft facilities or other sources without violating the most restrictive of those covenants. 
Credit Agreement 
The Company Credit Agreement, which expires July31, 2012, provides for a $95million U.S. dollar revolving credit facility, or U.S.
Revolver, and an 80million euro revolving credit facility, or Euro Revolver. Borrowings under the U.S. Revolver increased to $920million as of December31, 2008 from
$690million as of December31, 2007. Contractual availability under the U.S. Revolver decreased to $30million as of December31, 2008 from $260million as of
December31, 2007. Borrowings under the Euro Revolver increased to 321million euros, or $446million, as of December31,
2008 from zero as of December31, 2007. Contractual availability under the Euro Revolver decreased to 479million euros, or $666million, as of December31, 2008 from
800million euros, or $1113million, as of December31, 2007. 
Under
the Credit Agreement, interest rates are at market rates, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, for U.S. dollar borrowings and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or EURIBOR, for
euro borrowings, plus an applicable margin that varies from 035percent to 075percent per annum depending on the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement.
As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the applicable interest rate was 32% and 55%, respectively on its U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Agreement. As of December31, 2008, the
interest rate on Euro borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 54%. The Company incurs commitment fees at an annual rate of either 030 or 035percent of the applicable margin on the
committed amounts not drawn, depending on the Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. The Company also incurs utilization fees of 025percent per annum when
outstanding borrowings exceed 50percent of the total credit facility. 
The
Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties which are customary for facilities of this type and covenants and provisions that, among other things, require the Company to maintain
aa net debt to equity ratio not to exceed 10 and ba net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio not to exceed 30. The Company was in compliance with all the financial covenants of the
Credit Agreement as of December31, 2008. 
French Employee Profit Sharing 
At both December31, 2008 and 2007, long-term debt other than the U.S. Revolver and the Euro Revolver primarily consisted of
obligations of the French operations related to government-mandated profit sharing. Each year, representatives of the workers at each of the French businesses can make an election for the profit
sharing amounts from the most recent year ended to invest the funds in a financial institution or to invest the funds with their respective employer. To the extent that funds are invested with the
Company, these amounts bear interest at the 5-year treasury note rate in France, 457percent and 452percent at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are
generally payable in the fifth year subsequent to the year the profit sharing is accrued.  Bank Overdraft and Other 
The Company also has bank overdraft facilities totaling $357million, of which $236million was outstanding at December31,
2008 and reported as current debt on the consolidated balance sheet. Interest 
66 
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued is
incurred on outstanding amounts at market rates and was 29% at December31, 2008. No commitment fees are paid on the unused portion of these facilities. 
Other
debt consists of non-interest bearing French segment debt with deferred capital repayment from governmental and commercial institutions primarily related to environmental capital
improvements and debt in Brazil from governmental financing programs and bank institution advances on secured receivables. The Brazilian segment debt has market interest rates in Brazil ranging from
5 to 11percent. 
Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
The Company maintains interest rate swap agreements on a portion of its long-term debt. As of December31, 2008, the LIBOR rate
component on $300million and $80million of the Company variable-rate long-term debt was effectively fixed at 528percent and 544percent,
respectively. The $300million interest swap agreement expires on May30, 2009, and the $80million interest swap agreement expires on March16, 2009. In January 2009,
the Company entered into a 1-year agreement, effective March16, 2009, to replace its $8million swap agreement with a $17million swap agreement with a fixed interest
rate of 138percent. Effective May29, 2009, the Company $30million swap agreement will be fixed at 160percent until May30, 2010. The impact of the swap
agreements on the consolidated financial statements was not material for the year ended December31, 2008. 
Principal Repayments 
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company selects an interest period for each of its borrowings under the U.S. Revolver and Euro Revolver. The
Company can repay such
borrowings and borrow again at a subsequent date if it chooses to do so, providing it flexibility and efficient use of any excess cash. The Company expects to continue to file notices of continuation
related to its U.S. and Euro Revolver borrowings outstanding at December31, 2008 such that those amounts are not expected to be repaid prior to the July 2012 expiration of the Credit
Agreement. Following are the expected maturities for the Company debt obligations as of December31, 2008 dollars in millions:  2009 349 2010 93 2011 22 2012 1306 2013 26 Thereafter 02  1798 Fair Value of Debt 
At December31, 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair value of the Company current and long-term debt approximated the carrying
amount. The carrying value of substantially all of the Company outstanding debt approximated fair value since the interest rates were variable and based on current market indices.

benefits of foreign legal structure result from net foreign tax deductions from the restructuring of the Company foreign operations in 2003. The proportionate effect of this item on the overall
effective income tax rate decreases as earnings increase. 
The
Company considers the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested or plans to repatriate such earnings only when tax-effective to do so.
Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends, loans to the U.S. parent, or otherwise, the
Company could be liable for both U.S. income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to foreign tax authorities. Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred U.S. tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation. 
The
Company reorganized its legal entity structure in 2008. In conjunction with this reorganization, the Company decided that the undistributed earnings of LTRI will be permanently reinvested
resulting in a net deferred income tax charge of $12million.

Under
French tax law, NOLs incurred through 1994 by SMF subsidiaries unrelated to the Company businesses were retained by SMF as of January1, 1995 following SMF distribution of those
subsidiaries to Kimberly-Clark Corporation in the 1995 spin-off of Schweitzer-Mauduit. Additional NOLs have been generated due to operating losses incurred in recent periods in Brazil,
France and the Philippines as a result of lower operating earnings together with substantial restructuring expenses incurred in Brazil and France. Also, NOLs have been generated since 2003 by the SMH
tax group in France and by SM-Spain since its formation in 1997.

later of 15years subsequent to the year generated or 15years subsequent to the first year of taxable income in Spain which was 2000. Of the $2035million of NOLs available at
December31, 2008, $06million and $15million will expire in 2009 and 2010, respectively, if not utilized against taxable income in the Philippines, and $113million
will expire from 2015 to 2023 if not utilized against taxable income in Spain. Valuation allowances related to NOLs in Spain totaled $40million as of December31, 2008, fully reserving
the related deferred tax asset in Spain. The remaining $1901million of NOLs are in France and Brazil and have no expiration date. Although realization is not assured, the Company believes it
is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset of $653million, all of which relates to the NOLs in France, Brazil and the Philippines, will be realized. The Company assumptions,
judgments and estimates relative to the valuation of these net deferred tax assets take into account available positive and negative evidence of realizability, including recent financial performance,
the ability to realize benefits of restructuring and other recent actions, projections of the amount and category of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Actual future operating results
and the underlying amount and category of income in future periods could differ from the Company current assumptions, judgments and estimates. However, continued or future operating losses,
particularly in Brazil and the Company paper operations in France, could result in recording a valuation allowance in a future period. If at a future date the Company determines that the weight of
the positive evidence is not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence, a valuation allowance against the Company deferred tax assets to reduce these net deferred tax assets to an amount we
believe will more likely than not be realizable would be recorded in the period such determination is made.

addition to the NOLs above, the Company has federal research credits, certain state credits, primarily for investments in fixed assets in those states, and AMT credits at December31, 2008.
The Company expects to fully utilize all foreign tax credits generated in the current year and unexpired foreign tax credit carryfowards from prior years. Foreign tax credits carryforward
10years from the date generated. Estimated federal research credits and various U.S. state credits totaled $22million as of December31, 2008, of which the Company has
estimated that $04million of these credits will be realized prior to their expiration and thus have a valuation allowance of $18million at December31, 2008. The Company
U.S. federal AMT credits carry forward indefinitely and no valuation allowance has been recorded on the related $27million deferred tax asset at December31, 2008. 
The
Company adopted the provisions of FIN48 effective January1, 2007. Adoption of FIN48 had no cumulative effect on the Company consolidated financial position at
January1, 2007. At January1, 2007, December31, 2007 and December31, 2008, the Company had no significant unrecognized tax benefits related to income taxes. 
Note13. Postretirement and Other Benefits  North American Pension and Postretirement Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits 
The U.S. segment has defined benefit retirement plans that cover substantially all full-time employees. Retirement benefits are based on
either a cash balance benefit formula or a final average pay formula for certain employees who were grandfathered and retained retirement benefits under the terms of the plan prior to amendment of
the plan to include a cash balance benefit formula. For employees under the cash balance formula, the Company annually credits to the employee account balance a retirement contribution credit, which
is a percentage of the employee earnings based on age and years of vesting service in the plan, and an interest credit, based on the average yield for 30-year treasury bills. For
employees under the final average pay formula, retirement benefits are based on years of service and generally on the average compensation earned in the highest 5 of the last 15years of
service. 
In
May 2006, all affected hourly employees at the Lee Mills were notified that the further accrual of benefits under their defined benefit pension plan would be frozen as of July17, 2006. The
Lee Mills action necessitated a remeasurement of the Company accumulated benefit obligation, or ABO, under the U.S. pension plan and resulted in a curtailment gain of $01million during the
second quarter of 2006. During July 2007, benefits related to the defined benefit pension plan for hourly employees at the Spotswood mill were frozen effective as of December31, 2007. During
December 2008, benefits related to the defined benefit and pension plan for hourly employees at the Ancram mill were frozen effective December31, 2008.

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
The
U.S. segment also has unfunded healthcare and life insurance benefit plans, or OPEB plans, which cover substantially all of its retirees. Certain employees, who were grandfathered and retained
benefits under the terms of the Company plans prior to certain past amendments, receive retiree healthcare coverage at rates subsidized by the Company. For other eligible employees, retiree
healthcare coverage access is offered at full cost to the retiree. The postretirement healthcare plans include a limit on the U.S. segment share of costs for current and future retirees. The U.S.
segment retiree life insurance plans are noncontributory. The Company Canadian postretirement benefits liability is immaterial and therefore is not included in these disclosures. 
French Pension Benefits 
In France, employees are covered under a government-administered program. Also, the Company French operations sponsor retirement indemnity plans,
which pay a lump sum retirement benefit to all of its permanent employees who retire. In addition, the Company French operations sponsor a supplemental executive pension plan, which is designed to
provide a retirement benefit up to 65percent of final earnings, depending upon years of service, and the formula for which the employee is eligible. Plan assets are principally invested in the
general asset portfolio of a French insurance company. 
Restructuring
activities in the French segment necessitated a remeasurement of the ABO under the French pension plan and resulted in a curtailment gain of $04million in 2007, which was
recorded as a reduction in 2007 restructuring expense.  U.S. and French Pension and U.S. Other Postretirement Benefit Disclosures 
The U.S. pension and OPEB plans and French pension plans accounted for approximately 97percent of the Company total plan assets and
approximately 99percent of the Company total ABO at December31, 2008 for the Company and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.

are used to determine the Company benefit obligations. The rate used to discount the Company PBO back to a present value is called the discount rate. The discount rate fluctuates from
year to year based on current market interest rates for high-quality fixed-income investments. The Company also evaluates the expected average duration of its pension obligations in
determining its discount rate. A change in the discount rate assumption of 25 basis points would change the Company estimated 2009 U.S. pension expense by approximately $02million and have
a nominal effect on the Company estimated 2009 French pension expense. An assumed long-term rate of compensation increase is also used to determine the PBO. The weighted average

are used to determine net periodic benefit costs. In addition to the discount rate and rate of compensation increase, which are used to determine benefit obligations, an expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets is also used to determine net periodic pension benefit costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is used to reduce the
expected gross periodic cost of the Company benefits by that amount expected to be earned on assets of the plan. The expected long-term target rate of return on plan assets is based upon
the Company projected investment mix of plan assets, the assumption that future returns will be close to the historical long-term rate of return experienced for equity and fixed income
securities and a 10 to 15year investment horizon, so that fluctuations in the interim should be viewed with appropriate perspective. A change in the long-term rate of return
assumption of 25 basis points would change the Company estimated 2009 U.S. pension expense by approximately $02million and have a nominal effect on French pension expense. The weighted

The
Company investment strategy with respect to its U.S. pension plan assets is to maximize the return on investment of plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and to assure the plans' fiscal
health. The Company investment strategy with respect to its French pension plan assets is to invest plan assets at a low level of risk. The primary goal of the Company pension plans is to maintain
the highest probability of assuring future benefit payments to participants while providing growth of capital in real terms. To achieve this goal, the investment philosophy is to protect plan assets
from large investment losses, particularly over

while growing the assets as fast as prudently possible. While there cannot be complete assurance that the objectives will be realized, the Company believes that the likelihood of realizing the
objectives are reasonable based upon this investment philosophy. The Company has an investment committee that meets formally on a periodic basis to review the portfolio returns and to determine asset
mix targets. The U.S. and French pension plan asset target allocation by asset category for 2009 and actual allocation by asset category at December31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows: United States

in this category under the U.S. pension plan only may include hedge funds, and may include real estate under the French pension plan.

Other Benefits 
We sponsor a qualified defined contribution plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the plan, the Company matches a portion of employee
contributions. The Company cost under the plan was $19million, $16million, and $15million for the years ended December31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. 
The
Company provides U.S. executives, certain other key personnel and its directors the opportunity to participate in deferred compensation plans. Participating employees can elect to defer a portion
of their salaries and certain other compensation. Participating directors can elect to defer their meeting fees, as a cash deferral, as well as their quarterly retainer fees, as deferred stock unit
credits. The Company liability balance under these plans totaled $37million and $56million at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which were included on the
consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities. In connection with these plans, as well as the Company supplemental retirement and severance plans, the Company has a grantor trust into which it has

Effective December 1999, the Company established a Restricted Stock Plan, or RSP, which is intended to promote its long-term financial
success by attracting and retaining outstanding executive personnel and to motivate such personnel by means of restricted stock grants. The Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors
selects participants and establishes the terms of any grant of restricted stock. The Company RSP provides that issuance of restricted stock immediately transfers ownership rights in shares of its
Common Stock to the recipient of the grant, including the right to vote the shares and to receive dividends thereon, at a share price established by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. The
recipient continued ownership of and right to freely transfer the restricted stock is subject to such conditions on transferability and to such risks of forfeiture as are established by the
Compensation Committee at the time of the grant, which may include continued employment with the Company for a defined period, achievement of specified management performance objectives or other
conditions established by the Compensation Committee. The number of shares, which may be issued under this RSP, is limited to the lesser of 1,000,000 shares or the number of treasury shares held by
the Company as of the date of any grant. No single participant may be awarded, in the aggregate, more than 50percent of the shares authorized to be issued under the RSP. As of
December31, 2008, 371,981 restricted shares had been issued under the RSP of which 260,218 shares of issued restricted stock were not yet vested. The following table presents restricted stock

Other Commitments 
The French segment has a minimum purchase agreement for wood pulp of $173million during each of 2009 and 2010. The U.S. segment has an
agreement to purchase $33million in tobacco stems in 2009.

has a minimum annual commitment for calcium carbonate purchases, a raw material used in the manufacturing of some paper products, which totals approximately $2million per year through
2014. PdM future purchases at this mill are expected to be at levels that exceed such minimum levels under the contract. 
The
Company enters into certain other immaterial contracts from time to time for the purchase of certain raw materials. The Company also enters into certain contracts for the purchase of equipment and
related costs in connection with its ongoing capital projects, for which there were no material commitments at December31, 2008. During
2004, LTRI and PdM both entered into agreements with an energy cogeneration supplier whereby the supplier constructed and operates a cogeneration facility at the mills and supplies steam that
is used in the operation of the mills. The construction phase of the LTRI cogeneration facility was completed in late 2005 and the PdM cogeneration facility was placed in service during the fourth
quarter of 2007, with the supplier bearing the entire capital cost of both projects. Following start-up of these facilities, LTRI and PdM are committed to purchasing minimum annual amounts
of steam generated by each of these facilities for a period of 15years under the agreements. These minimum annual commitments together total approximately $4 to $5million. LTRI and
PdM current and expected requirements for steam are at levels that exceed the minimum levels under the respective contracts. 
During
2006, our Brazil segment, or SWM-B, and PdM separately entered into agreements for the transmission and distribution of energy. The SWM-B contract for the electrical
energy supply is for the period May1, 2006 to December31, 2010 covering 100percent of the mill consumption of electrical energy. The value of the electric energy being
provided under this contract is approximately $5million annually. The PdM agreement provides for the supply of 100percent of its requirements for natural gas and associated
distribution to service its paper mill. The value of the natural gas and distribution to be provided under this contract is estimated at approximately $249million and $115million in
2009 and 2010, respectively. 
As
of December31, 2008, the Company had issued guarantee instruments in connection with certain agreements and as required by regulatory agencies in connection with certain of its ongoing
obligations, as follows: iThe Company has a letter of credit to a standby trust of which the State of Massachusetts is the beneficiary in the principal amount of $15million related
to its ongoing obligation for post-closure monitoring and maintenance of a landfill site. The Company has a liability recorded at December31, 2008 of $05million based on
its current estimate of the remaining costs to perform such post-closure care. iiSince 1995, the Company has issued an annual letter of credit to an insurance company, the
current principal amount of which was $10million as of December31, 2008, in connection with its administration of its workers compensation claims in the United States, for which it
has recorded a liability of $21million at December31, 2008. iiiThe Company has certain other letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding at December31, 2008,
which are not material either individually or in the aggregate. 
Litigation 
Imposto sobre Circulao de Mercadorias e Servios,or ICMS, a form of value-added tax in Brazil, was assessed to
SWM-B in December of 2000. SWM-B received 2 assessments from the tax authorities of the State of Rio de Janeiro for unpaid ICMS taxes from January 1995 through November 2000,
which together with interest and penalties totaled approximately $14million based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2000, collectively the Assessment. 
The
Assessment concerned the accrual and use by SWM-B of ICMS tax credits generated from the production and sale of certain non-tobacco related grades of paper sold
domestically that are immune 
81 
SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued from
the tax to offset ICMS taxes otherwise owed on the sale of products that are not immune. One of the 2 assessments related in part to tax periods that predated the Company acquisition of Pirahy
and is covered in part by an indemnification from the sellers of Pirahy, or Assessment 1 case number2001001115144-5. The second assessment pertains exclusively to periods that
SWM-B owned the Pirahy mill, or Assessment 2 case number2001001064544-6. While SWM-B is primarily responsible for the full payment of the Assessment in
the event of an ultimate unfavorable outcome, SWM-B is not aware of any difficulties that would be encountered in obtaining reimbursement of that portion of any payment resulting from
Assessment 1 from the previous owner under the indemnification. 
SWM-B
has contested the Assessment based on Article150, VI of the Brazilian Federal Constitution of 1988, which grants immunity from ICMS taxes to papers used in the production of
books, newspapers and periodicals, or immune papers, and the raw material inputs used to produce immune papers. Presently, part of the Assessment, for which SWM-B has received favorable
lower court rulings, is pending on appeal before the Federal Supreme Court under case number A1588187 and another part of the Assessment, for which SWM-B has primarily received unfavorable
lower court rulings, is pending on appeal before the Third Vice Presidency under case no200513405319. 
SWM-B
continues to vigorously contest the Assessment and believes that the Assessment will ultimately be resolved in its favor. However, since the final resolution involves presentation of
the matter to the Supreme Court of Brazil, it is not likely to be finally resolved in the near future. Based on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2008, the Assessment totaled
approximately $20 to $21million as of December31, 2008, of which approximately $10million is covered by the above-discussed indemnification. No liability has been recorded in
the Company consolidated financial statements for the Assessment based on its evaluation that SWM-B is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the Assessment under the facts
and law as presently understood. 
In
February 2004, SWM-B filed suit against the State of Rio de Janeiro in the 11thCourt of Public sitting in Rio de Janeiro, case
number2004001022063-6, to recover ICMS credits previously reversed in 2000 following receipt of the Assessment. After the Assessment was filed against SWM-B, it
changed its procedures and did not utilize ICMS tax credits through the end of production and sale of immune papers during 2001. As a result of having received favorable lower court rulings to the
Assessment, SWM-B petitioned the court for permission to offset overpaid ICMS taxes against current tax liabilities. The amount of the claim totals approximately $2million, based
on the foreign currency exchange rate at December31, 2008. In August 2006, SWM-B filed an interlocutory appeal, which has not yet been ruled upon. As of December31, 2008,
no asset has been recorded for this potential recovery. 
Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados,or IPI, a form of federal value-added tax in Brazil. Schweitzer-Mauduit do Brasil v. Federal Union, Federal Regional
Tribunal sitting in Rio de Janeiro, case number20045104000502-4 March5, 2004. 
SWM-B
instituted action in March 2004 to recover credits on past and future purchases of raw materials that are exempt from IPI taxes or that carry an IPI tax rate of zero. The recovery
would be in the form of presumed credits that could be applied to offset other IPI tax liabilities. The action for recovery is based on the principle in Brazilian law of non-cumulative
taxes. The potential recovery of IPI credits, depending upon several contested factors, could be in the range of $10 to $20million, which amounts the Company considers a gain contingency and
has not recorded in its consolidated financial statements. While a favorable ruling was received at the first court level during March 2007, the Company received an unfavorable ruling on appeal in the
Second Degree and the Company has appealed that ruling to the Superior Court of Justice where the matter is still pending. The final resolution of this matter will likely

SCHWEITZER-MAUDUIT INTERNATIONAL,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued entail
judicial proceedings up to and including presentation of the matter to the Supreme Court of Brazil and is not likely to be resolved for several years. 
Indemnification Matters 
In connection with its spin-off from Kimberly-Clark in 1995, the Company undertook to indemnify and hold Kimberly-Clark harmless from
claims and liabilities related to the businesses transferred to it that were not identified as excluded liabilities in the related agreements. As of December31, 2008, there are no claims
pending under this indemnification that the Company deems to be material. 
General Matters  The Company is involved in certain other legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Management believes that such
litigation and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial statements. 
Environmental Matters 
The Company operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental matters. The
nature of the Company operations exposes it to the risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in
connection with such claims. While the Company has incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and
regulations, it believes that its future cost of compliance with environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, and its exposure to liability for environmental claims and its obligation to
participate in the remediation and monitoring of certain hazardous waste disposal sites, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. However, future
events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or unknown contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by the Company including contamination caused by prior owners
and operators of such sites or other waste generators may give rise to additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
The
Company incurs spending necessary to meet legal requirements and otherwise relating to the protection of the environment at its facilities in the United States, France, the Philippines, Indonesia,
Brazil and Canada. For these purposes, the Company incurred total capital expenditures of $03million in 2008, and expects to incur less than $1million in each of 2009 and 2010, of
which no material amount is the result of environmental fines or settlements. The foregoing capital expenditures are not expected to reduce the Company ability to invest in other appropriate and
necessary capital projects and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations. 
Note16. Acquisition 
In January 2008, 2 of the Company French subsidiaries purchased the 28percent minority interest in LTRI owned by
Socit Nationale d'Exploitation Industrielle des Tabacs et Allumettes,S.A., a subsidiary of Altadis,S.A., subsequent to which the Company owns
100percent of LTRI outstanding shares. Sole ownership of LTRI is expected to provide enhanced strategic flexibility and improved earnings and cash flow. The purchase price of
350million euros, funded by borrowings under the Company Euro Revolver, was allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including an allocation of
$10million to identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net 
83

acquired resulted in goodwill of $64million. The following table summarizes the final allocation, of the 350million euros, or $513million, purchase price for the
acquisition dollars in millions:  Purchase Price 35million euros 513 Carrying Value 262 Step-Up in Basis 251 Allocation of Step-Up in Basis Inventories 01 Land 21 Tangible depreciable assets 162 Amortizable customer-related intangibles 100 Goodwill 64 Deferred income tax liability 97 Total Step-Up in Basis 251 The
Company is amortizing LTRI customer-related intangibles using the 150percent declining balance method over a 6-year amortizable life. The Company recorded amortization
expense of $25million during 2008. Additionally, the Company recorded $16million of incremental depreciation expense as a result of the stepped-up bases in depreciable
property, plant and equipment during 2008. 
The
increased bases in the LTRI assets are not tax deductible in France. In accordance with SFAS No109, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for the nondeductible purchase allocations
to inventories, land, tangible depreciable assets and amortizable intangibles, but no deferred income tax balance was recorded related to goodwill.

General Information 
The Company operates and manages 3 reportable segments: United States, or U.S., France and Brazil. These segments are based on the geographical
location of the Company manufacturing operations. These business segments manufacture and sell cigarette, plug wrap and tipping papers used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted
tobacco products and paper products used in cigarette packaging, as well as certain non-tobacco industry products. While the products are similar in each segment, they vary based on
customer requirements and the manufacturing capabilities of each of the operations. The Philippine and Indonesian financial results are included in the French business segment because the results of
the Philippine and Indonesian operations are not material for segment reporting purposes and since the products of the Philippine and Indonesian businesses are coordinated with sales of the Company
French operations in southeast Asia. Sales by a segment into markets primarily served by a different segment occur where specific product needs cannot be cost-effectively met by the
manufacturing operations domiciled in that segment. 
Tobacco
industry products comprised approximately 90percent of the Company consolidated net sales in each of the years 2006 through 2008. Non-tobacco industry products are a
diverse mix of products, certain of which represent commodity paper grades produced to maximize machine operations.

Information about Sales, Profit and Assets 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies see
Note2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company primarily evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on
operating profit loss and cash flow. 
For
purposes of the segment disclosure in the following tables, the term United States includes operations in the United States and Canada. The Canadian operations only produce flax fiber used as a
raw material in the U.S. operations. The term France includes operations in France, Indonesia and the Philippines. Sales of products between segments are made at market prices and elimination of
these sales is referred to in the following tables as intersegment sales. Expense amounts not associated with segments are referred to as unallocated expenses. Assets reported by segment represent
assets which are directly used by that segment. Unallocated items and eliminations, net include immaterial balances of the Company holding company in Spain.

Philip Morris USAInc., Philip Morris International, BAT, JTI, and Imperial together with their respective affiliates and designated
converters, accounted for 60percent, 50percent and 47percent of the Company 2008, 2007 and 2006 consolidated net sales, respectively. The loss of 1 or more such customers, or
a significant reduction in 1 or more of these customers' purchases, could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of operations. 
Since
January1, 1993, the Company has been the single source of supply of Cigarette Papers to Altria Group U.S. cigarette manufacturing operations, or Philip Morris USA. During December
2006, the Company provided Philip Morris USA with a notice of phase-out of the Second Amended and Restated Agreement for Fine Paper Supply, or SSA, between the 2 companies, effective
December31, 2006. Under the phase-out terms of the SSA, the Company was obligated to supply up to 100percent of Philip Morris USA annual cigarette, base tipping and plug
wrap paper requirements for 2008 at current selling prices, which was subject to potential increases. Philip Morris
USA was obligated to purchase from the Company at least 50percent of its annual cigarette, base tipping and plug wrap paper requirements for 2008. The phase-out expired on
December31, 2008, and neither company has any further obligation under the SSA. 
The
Company also has an exclusive supply arrangement with Philip Morris USA for a jointly-developed banded cigarette paper that is used in lower ignition propensity, or LIP, cigarettes. The Company
produces banded cigarette paper in sufficient quantities to support Philip Morris USA commercial sales of LIP cigarettes. The notification of phase-out of the SSA does not affect the
supply agreement between the Company and Philip Morris USA concerning banded cigarette paper used to produce LIP cigarettes. Under this agreement, Philip Morris USA is obligated to purchase
100percent of its requirements for banded cigarette papers for a minimum period of 7years, and the Company is obligated to supply such product for a minimum of 13years. 
In
January 2008, we acquired the minority interest of LTRI. The Company had sales to the former minority shareholder of LTRI of $279million and $216million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Philip
Morris USA, Phillip Morris International, BAT, JTI, and Imperial, together with their respective affiliates and designated converters accounted for 55percent and 38percent of
consolidated trade accounts receivable at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Trade receivables due from China Tobacco accounted for 8percent and 4percent of consolidated
trade receivables at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. 
The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations on all of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables. Substantial
portions of the Company consolidated accounts receivable are due from companies in the tobacco industry, which has been and continues to be under substantial pressure from legal, regulatory and tax
developments. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation, regulatory actions and additional taxes may have on the
tobacco industry, its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers. Nor is it possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted, or
to what extent, if any, such legislation or regulations might affect the tobacco products industry in general.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. and Subsidiaries
Alpharetta, Georgia 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
consolidated statements of income loss, changes in stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
As
discussed in Note2 as of December31, 2006, the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans to conform to Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No158, Employer Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Post Retirement Plans. We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the Company internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March6, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting.   Deloitte

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
We have established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries,
is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. Based
on their evaluation as of December31, 2008, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended were effective at a reasonable assurance level to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by us in this Annual Report on Form10-K was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and
instructions for Form10-K. Last year the Chief Executive Officer submitted a Section12a CEO Certification to the NYSE and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer submitted the certification required under Section302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as Exhibits311 and 312 to the Form10-K filed on March7, 2008. There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December31, 2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting. 
Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, is designed to provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in
all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Schweitzer-Mauduit International,Inc. have been
detected. As of December31, 2008, we had no material weaknesses based on our tests using the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company evaluation under the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework, our management has concluded that, as of December31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our
independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte ToucheLLP, has issued an audit report on its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included
herein.
