LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of
Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which Lennar Corporation has a controlling interest and variable interest entities see Note 18 in which Lennar Corporation is deemed the
primary beneficiary the Company. The Companys investments in both unconsolidated entities in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and in variable interest entities in which the Company is not deemed to
be the primary beneficiary are accounted for by the equity method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Share-Based Payments  The Company has share-based awards outstanding under four different plans which provide for the granting of stock options and stock appreciation rights
and awards of restricted common stock nonvested shares to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date
of the grant. No options granted under the plans may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock
appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than ten years after the date of the grant.  Prior to December1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock option awards granted under the plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement
provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, APB 25 and related Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123. Share-based employee compensation expense was not recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings prior to December1,
2005, as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Effective December1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, SFAS 123R using the  method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized during the year ended November30, 2006 included:
acompensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and
bcompensation expense for all share-based awards granted subsequent to December1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the 
method, results for prior periods have not been restated.  As a
result of adopting SFAS 123R, the charge to earnings before provision for income taxes for the year ended November30, 2006 was $256 million. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on net earnings for the year ended November30, 2006 was $185
million. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended November30, 2006 was $012 per share and $011 per share, respectively. See Note 15 for details related to share-based payments. 
Revenue Recognition  Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and
title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowners initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowners receivable is not subject to future subordination and the Company
does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home in accordance with SFAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate SFAS 66. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is
received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and the collectibility of the receivables is reasonably assured. 
51  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Advertising Costs  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $1555 million, $823 million and $603 million
for the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  Cash  The Company considers all highly
liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values. Cash as of
November30, 2006 and 2005 included $1359 million and $1936 million, respectively, of cash primarily held in escrow for approximately three days.  Restricted Cash  Restricted cash consists of customer deposits on home sales held in restricted accounts until title transfers to the homebuyer as required by the state
and local governments in which the homes were sold.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at cost unless
the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory would be written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land
purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. The Company reviews inventories for impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived
Assets, SFAS 144. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the assets. Write-downs of inventories deemed to be impaired are recorded as adjustments to the cost
basis of the respective inventories. During the years ended November30, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $5018 million and $205 million, respectively, of inventory adjustments, which included $2805 million of homebuilding inventory
valuation adjustments in 2006 no adjustments in 2005, $1522 million and $151 million, respectively, in 2006 and 2005 of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land under option that the Company does not intend to purchase
and $691 million and $54 million, respectively, in 2006 and 2005 of land inventory valuation adjustments. During the year ended November 30, 2004, the Company recorded $168 million of write-offs of deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to
land under option that it does not intend to purchase. These valuation adjustments were calculated based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions change.
Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as
incurred. Homes held-for-sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas.  Interest and Real Estate Taxes  Interest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are
capitalized as inventories while they are being actively developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to
the financial services operations is included in its costs and expenses.  During 2006, 2005 and 2004, interest incurred by the Companys homebuilding operations was $2475 million, $1729 million and $1379 million, respectively; interest capitalized into inventories was $2263
million, $1711 million and $1376 million, respectively; and interest expense primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold was $2411 million, $1872 million and $1342 million, respectively.  Operating Properties and Equipment  Operating properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are included in
other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is thirty years, for furniture, fixtures and equipment is two to ten years and for
leasehold improvements is five years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. 
52  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Investment Securities  Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are classified as trading or held-to-maturity.
Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because they are purchased with the intent and
ability to hold to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss, which is a separate
component of stockholders equity, net of tax, until realized.  At November30, 2006 and 2005, investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaled $596 million and $321 million, respectively, and were included in the assets of the Financial Services segment. The held-to-maturity
securities consist mainly of certificates of deposit and U.S. treasury securities. At November30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had investment securities classified as trading that totaled $85 million and $87 million, respectively, and were
included in other assets of the Homebuilding operations. The trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable equity mutual funds designated to approximate the Companys liabilities under its deferred compensation plan. Additionally, at
November30, 2006, the Company had no investment securities classified as available-for-sale, compared to $89 million in the prior year included in other assets of the Homebuilding operations. The available-for-sale securities were comprised
of municipal bonds with an original maturity of 20 years and were sold in 2006.  Derivative Financial Instruments  SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, SFAS 133, as amended and interpreted, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income or loss and recognized in the statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, depending on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for
hedge accounting treatment.  The Companys policy is to
designate at a derivatives inception the specific assets, liabilities, or future commitments being hedged and monitor the derivative to determine if it remains an effective hedge. The effectiveness of a derivative as a hedge is based on high
correlation between changes in its value and changes in the value of the underlying hedged item. The Company recognizes gains or losses for amounts received or paid when the underlying transaction settles. The Company does not enter into or hold
derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  The Company
has various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on $2000 million of outstanding debt related to its homebuilding operations. The swap agreements have been designated as cash flow
hedges and, accordingly, are reflected at their fair value in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at November30, 2006 and 2005. The related loss is deferred, net of tax, in stockholders equity as accumulated other
comprehensive loss. The Company accounts for its interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, as described in SFAS 133. Amounts to be received or paid as a result of the swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest incurred on the
related debt instruments. The Company believes that there will be no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps and therefore no portion of the accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into future earnings. The net effect on
the Companys operating results is that interest on the variable-rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates.  The Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. The segment enters into mortgage-backed securities MBS forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, MBS option contracts to protect the value of fixed rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in
market interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are designated as fair value hedges, and, accordingly, for all qualifying and highly effective fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the loss or gain on
the hedged asset related to the risk being hedged are recorded currently in earnings.

Goodwill  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business
combinations. At November30, 2006 and 2005, goodwill was $2578 million and $2531 million, respectively. During fiscal 2006, the Companys goodwill had a net increase of $47 million due to an acquisition by the Financial Services
segment and payment of contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions. During fiscal 2005, the Companys goodwill increased $138 million due to 2005 acquisitions and payment of contingent consideration related to prior period
acquisitions. Goodwill is included in the assets of the Homebuilding segments $1966 million and $1952 million, respectively, at November30, 2006 and 2005 and the assets of the Financial Services segment $612 million and $580 million,
respectively, at November30, 2006 and 2005 in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company reviews goodwill annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist for impairment in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The Company performed its annual
impairment test of goodwill as of September30, 2006 and determined that goodwill was not impaired. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 or 2004. As of November30, 2006 and 2005, there were no
material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill.  Income Taxes  Income taxes are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting carrying values and tax
bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.  Product Warranty  Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard
to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. The Company constantly monitors the
warranty reserve and makes adjustments to its pre-existing warranties in order to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Warranty reserves are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
The activity in the Companys warranty reserve was as follows:  November30 2006 2005 In thousands Warranty reserve, beginning of year 144,916 116,826 Warranties issued during the period 170,020 145,519 Adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates 25,487 31,766 Payments 167,852 149,195 Warranty reserve, end of year 172,571 144,916  Self-Insurance
Certain insurable risks such as general liability, medical
and workers compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Companys self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported.
Minority Interest  The Company has consolidated certain joint ventures because the Company
either was determined to be the primary beneficiary pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No46R FIN 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, or has a controlling
interest in these joint ventures. Therefore, the entities financial statements are consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements and the other partners equity is recorded as minority interest. At November30,
2006 and 2005, minority interest was $554 million and $782 million, respectively. Minority interest expense, net was $134 million, $450 million and $108 million, respectively, for the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Earnings per Share  Earnings per share is accounted for in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings per Share, which requires a dual
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common
stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.  Financial Services  Loan origination revenues, net of
direct origination costs and gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates
of the policies. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow.  Loans held-for-sale by the Financial Services segment that are designated as hedged assets are carried at fair value because the effect of changes in fair
value are reflected in the carrying amount of the loans and in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized.  When the segment sells loans in the secondary mortgage market, a gain or loss
is recognized to the extent that the sales proceeds exceed, or are less than, the book value of the loans. Substantially all of these loans were sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis;
however, the Company remains liable for certain limited representations and warranties related to loan sales. Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as a component of the gain or loss when loans are sold.
Loans for which the segment has the positive intent and
ability to hold to maturity consist of mortgage loans carried at cost, net of unamortized discounts. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is recognized as
earned over the term of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates.  The segment also provides an allowance for loan losses. The provision recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by managements continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past
loan loss experience, credit worthiness and nature of underlying collateral, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic factors, which may influence the level of the allowance,
are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a
result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond managements control.  New Accounting Pronouncements  In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes-an interpretation of SFAS 109, FIN
48. FIN 48 provides interpretive guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2006
the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2007. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of this Interpretation on its consolidated financial statements.  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements, SFAS 157. SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007 the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS 157 is not expected to materially affect how the Company determines fair value. 
55  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Staff issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, SAB 108. SAB 108 addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial
statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements. SAB 108 requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in
quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors. SAB 108 is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November15, 2006 the Companys fiscal year
ended November30, 2006. SAB 108 did not have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  In November 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment
under FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums, EITF 06-8. EITF 06-8 establishes that a company should evaluate the adequacy of the buyers continuing investment in determining
whether to recognize profit under the percentage-of-completion method. EITF 06-8 is effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after March15, 2007 the Companys fiscal year beginning December1, 2007. The effect of
this EITF is not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements.  Reclassifications  Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2006 presentation. These reclassifications
had no impact on reported net earnings.  2.Discontinued
Operations  In May 2005, the Company sold North American
Exchange Company NAEC, a subsidiary of the Financial Services segments title company, which generated a $158 million pretax gain. NAECs revenues were $33 million and $39 million, respectively, for the years ended
November30, 2005 and 2004. As of November30, 2005, there were no remaining assets or liabilities of discontinued operations.  3.Acquisitions  During 2006, the Company did not have any material acquisitions. During 2005, the Company expanded its presence through homebuilding acquisitions in all
of its homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company paid $4160 million. The results of operations of these acquisitions are
included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not presented as the effect is not material. Total goodwill associated with
these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to acquisitions prior to 2005 was $138 million.  During 2004, the Company expanded its presence through homebuilding acquisitions in all of its homebuilding segments, expanded its mortgage operations in
Oregon and Washington and expanded its title and closing business into Minnesota through the acquisition of Title Protection, Inc. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company
paid $1057 million, net of cash acquired. The results of operations of these acquisitions are included in the Companys results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results
of operations is not presented as the effect is not material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to acquisitions prior to 2004 was $267 million.  4.Operating and Reporting Segments  The Companys operating segments are aggregated into reportable
segments in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. The Companys
reportable segments consist of:  1
Homebuilding East 2
Homebuilding Central 3
Homebuilding West 4
Financial Services 
56  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Information about homebuilding activities in states which are not economically similar to other
states in the same geographic area is grouped under Homebuilding Other, which is not considered a reportable segment in accordance with SFAS 131.  Operations of the Companys homebuilding segments primarily include the sale and construction of single-family attached and detached homes, and to a
lesser extent, multi-level buildings, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Companys unconsolidated entities. The Companys reportable homebuilding segments, and all other homebuilding
operations not required to be reported separately, have divisions located in the following states:  East: Florida, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia Central: Arizona, Colorado and Texas West: California and Nevada Other: Illinois, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina  Operations of the Financial Services segment include mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and other
ancillary services including personal lines insurance, high-speed Internet and cable television for both buyers of the Companys homes and others. Substantially all of the loans the Financial Services segment originated were sold in the
secondary mortgage market on a servicing released non-recourse basis; however, the Company remains liable for certain limited representations and warranties related to loan sales. The Financial Services segment operates generally in the same states
as the Companys homebuilding segments, as well as other states.  Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings from continuing operations before provision for income taxes. Operating earnings for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes
and land, equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities and management fees and other income, net, less the cost of homes and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and minority interest expense, net. Operating earnings for
the Financial Services segment consist of revenues generated from mortgage financing, title insurance and other ancillary services including personal lines insurance, high-speed Internet and cable television less the cost of such services and
certain selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the Financial Services segment.  Each reportable segment follows the same accounting policies described in Note 1Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the
consolidated financial statements. Operational results of each segment are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

For the year ended November30, 2006, the Companys share of net loss recognized from unconsolidated entities includes $1264 million of valuation adjustments to the
Companys investments in unconsolidated entities.  The Companys partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. The unconsolidated entities follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the 
60  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
day-to-day manager of the unconsolidated entities and receives management fees and/or reimbursement of expenses for performing this function. During 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from the unconsolidated entities totaling $728 million, $586 million and $406 million, respectively.  The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can
purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the Company receives the options. During 2006, 2005 and 2004, $7425 million, $4312 million and $5476
million, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to the Company. The Company does not include in its equity in earnings loss from unconsolidated entities its pro rata share of unconsolidated entities
earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of the
Companys share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until the Company delivers a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.  The unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of
partner equity and debt financing. As of November30, 2006, the Companys equity in these unconsolidated entities represented 39% of the entities total equity. In some instances, the Company and its partners have guaranteed debt of
certain unconsolidated entities.  The Companys summary of
guarantees related to its unconsolidated entities was as follows:  November30,2006 In thousands Sole recourse debt 18,920 Several recourse debtrepayment 163,508 Several recourse debtmaintenance 560,823 Joint and several recourse debtrepayment 64,473 Joint and several recourse debtmaintenance 956,682 The Companys maximum recourse exposure 1,764,406 Less joint and several reimbursement agreements with the Companys partners 661,486 The Companys net recourse exposure 1,102,920  The maintenance
amounts above are the Companys maximum exposure of loss, which assumes that the fair value of the underlying collateral is zero. As of November30, 2006 and 2005, the fair values of the maintenance guarantees and repayment guarantees were
not material.  In addition, the Company and/or its partners
occasionally grant liens on their interest in a joint venture in order to help secure a loan to that joint venture. When the Company and/or its partners provide guarantees, the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its
lenders than would otherwise be available to it. In a repayment guarantee, the Company and its venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against
the collateral. The maintenance guarantees only apply if the value or the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If the Company is required to make a payment under a maintenance
guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase the Companys share of any funds the
unconsolidated entity distributes. During 2006, amounts paid under the Companys maintenance guarantees were not material. As of November 30, 2006, if there was an occurrence of a triggering event or condition under a guarantee, the collateral
would be sufficient to repay the obligation.  In November 2003,
the Company and LNR Property Corporation LNR each contributed its 50% interests in certain of its jointly-owned unconsolidated entities that had significant assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities
Development LLC LandSource in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July 2003, the Company and LNR formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL, which in January 2004 purchased The Newhall Land and Farming Company
Newhall for a total of approximately $1 billion. Newhalls primary business is developing two master-planned communities in Los Angeles County, California. 
61  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
LandSource was formed as a vehicle to obtain financing based on the value of the combined assets of
the joint venture entities that the Company and LNR contributed to LandSource. The Company and LNR used LandSources financing capacity, together with the financing value of Newhalls assets, to obtain improved financing for part of the
purchase price of Newhall and for working capital to be used by the LandSource subsidiaries and Newhall.  The Company and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL, and LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which
$400 million was a term loan used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income-producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217 million at the closing of the
transaction. The remainder of the bank financing was a $200 million revolving credit facility that is available to finance operations of Newhall and other property ownership and development companies that are jointly owned by the Company and LNR.

Prior to December1, 2005, the Company accounted for stock option awards granted under the plans in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of APB 25 and related Interpretations, as permitted by SFAS 123. Share-based
employee compensation expense was not recognized in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings prior to December1, 2005, as all stock option awards granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market
value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Effective December1, 2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123R using the  method. Under this transition method, compensation expense recognized
during the year ended November30, 2006 included: acompensation expense for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS 123, and bcompensation expense for all share-based awards granted subsequent to December1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. In accordance
with the  method, results for prior periods have not been restated.  As a result of adopting SFAS 123R, the charge to earnings before provision for income taxes for the year ended November30, 2006 was $256 million.
The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on net earnings for the year ended November30, 2006 was $185 million. The impact of adopting SFAS 123R on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended November30, 2006 was $012 per share and
$011 per share, respectively. 
70  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company presented all tax benefits related to deductions
resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS 123R requires that cash flows resulting from tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation
expense recognized for those options excess tax benefits be classified as financing cash flows. As a result, the Company classified $71 million of excess tax benefits as financing cash inflows for the year ended November30, 2006.
The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and
earnings per share for the years ended November30, 2005 and 2004, if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and
Disclosure, to stock options awards granted under the Companys share-based payment plans. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the stock option awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and amortized
to expense over the options vesting periods.

related to the Companys share-based awards for the year ended November30, 2006 was $366 million of which $256 million related to stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and $110 million related to nonvested shares.
During the years ended November30, 2005 and 2004, compensation expense related to the Companys share-based awards was $69 million and $30 million, respectively, which primarily related to nonvested shares. The total income tax benefit
recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings for share-based awards during the year ended November30, 2006 was $100 million of which $71 million related to stock options resulting from the adoption of SFAS 123R and $29 million
related to nonvested shares. During the years ended November30, 2005 and 2004, the income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings for share-based awards was $26 million and $11 million, respectively, all of which
related to nonvested shares.  Cash received from stock options
exercised during the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $311 million, $381 million and $145 million, respectively. The tax deductions related to stock options exercised during the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and
2004 were $121 million, $232 million and $86 million, respectively.  The fair value of each of the Companys stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. The fair value of the Companys stock
option awards, which are subject to graded vesting, is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on an average of 1historical volatility of the Companys stock and
2implied volatility from traded options on the Companys stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond on the date the stock
option award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option award granted. The Company uses historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within its valuation model. The expected life of stock option
awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the Companys share-based payment plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding.

nonvested shares. That expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 32 years. During the years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, 01 million nonvested shares, 05 million nonvested shares and 05 million
nonvested shares, respectively, vested. The tax deductions related to nonvested share activity during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $37 million, $160 million and $45 million, respectively.  16.Deferred Compensation Plan 
In June 2002, the Company adopted the Lennar Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan the Deferred Compensation Plan that
allows a selected group of members of management to defer a portion of their salaries and bonuses and up to 100% of their restricted stock. All participant contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are vested. Salaries and bonuses that are
deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings or losses based on investment decisions made by the participants. The cash contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are invested by the Company in various investment
securities that are classified as trading.  Restricted stock is
deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan by surrendering the restricted stock in exchange for the right to receive in the future a number of shares equal to the number of restricted shares that are surrendered. The surrender is reflected as a
reduction in stockholders equity equal to the fair value of the restricted stock when it was issued, with an offsetting increase in stockholders equity to reflect a deferral of the compensation expense related to the surrendered
restricted stock. Changes in the fair value of the shares that will be issued in the future are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.  As of November30, 2006, approximately 172,000 ClassA common shares and 17,200 Class B common shares of restricted stock had been surrendered
in exchange for rights under the Deferred Compensation Plan, resulting in a reduction in stockholders equity of $16 million fully offset by an increase in stockholders equity to reflect the deferral of compensation in that amount.
Shares that the Company is obligated to issue in the future under the Deferred Compensation Plan are treated as outstanding shares in both the Companys basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended November30,
2006, 2005 and 2004.  17.Financial Instruments 
The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair
values of financial instruments held by the Company at November30, 2006 and 2005, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting
market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or
estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The table excludes cash, restricted cash, receivables and accounts payable, which had fair values approximating their carrying values due to the short
maturities of these instruments.

The following methods
and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:  HomebuildingSince there are no quoted market prices for investments classified as available-for-sale, the fair value is estimated from available yield curves for investments of similar quality and terms. The fair value for
investments classified as trading is based on quoted market prices. For senior notes and other debts payable, the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings is based on quoted market prices. Variable-rate borrowings are tied to market indices and therefore
approximate fair value. The fair value for interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotations and generally represents an estimate of the amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate the agreement at the reporting date.  Financial servicesThe fair values are based on quoted market
prices, if available. The fair values for instruments that do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial information.  The Homebuilding operations utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage
interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. Credit losses from counterparty non-performance are not anticipated. A majority of the Homebuilding
operations variable interest rate borrowings are based on the LIBOR index. At November30, 2006, the Homebuilding operations had three interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a total notional amount of $200 million, which will
mature at various dates through fiscal 2008. These agreements fixed the LIBOR index at an average interest rate of 68% at November30, 2006. The effect of interest rate swap agreements on interest incurred and on the average interest rate was
an increase of $38 million and 010%, respectively, for the year ended November30, 2006, an increase of $110 million and 040%, respectively, for the year ended November30, 2005 and an increase of $165 million and 089%, respectively,
for the year ended November30, 2004.  The Financial
Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $29 billion at November30, 2006. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $3239 million as of November30, 2006.
Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. 
74  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities MBS forward
commitments and MBS option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS forward commitments and MBS option contracts only with investment banks with primary dealer status and loan sales transactions with permanent investors
meeting the segments credit standards. The segments risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current fair value. At November30, 2006, the segment had open commitments
amounting to $3350 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2007.  18.Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  The Company follows FIN 46R, which requires the consolidation of certain entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entitys expected losses, receives a majority of the entitys expected
residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity.  Unconsolidated Entities  At November30, 2006, the Company had investments in and advances to unconsolidated entities established to acquire and develop land for sale to the
Company in connection with its homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. The Company evaluated all agreements under FIN 46R during 2006 that were entered into or had
reconsideration events and it consolidated entities that at November30, 2006 had total combined assets and liabilities of $1678 million and $1233 million, respectively.  At November30, 2006 and 2005, the Companys recorded investment in unconsolidated entities was $14 billion and
$13 billion, respectively. The Companys estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated entities was primarily its recorded investments in these entities and the exposure under the guarantees discussed in Note 6. 
Option Contracts  In the Companys homebuilding operations, the Company has access to
land through option contracts, which generally enables it to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties including land funds and unconsolidated entities until the Company is ready to build homes on them.  At November30, 2006, the Company had access through option contracts to
189,279 homesites, of which 94,758 were through option contracts with third parties and 94,521 were through option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments. At November30, 2005, the Company had access through
option contracts to 222,119 homesites, of which 127,013 were through option contracts with third parties and 95,106 were through option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which the Company has investments.  A majority of the Companys option contracts require a non-refundable
cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. These options are generally rolling options, in which the Company acquires homesites based on pre-determined take-down schedules. The
Companys option contracts often include price escalators, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at time of the acquisition. The exercise periods of the Companys option contracts vary on a case-by-case
basis, but generally range from one to ten years.  The
Companys investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case the Companys investments are written down to fair value. The Company reviews option contracts for
impairment during each reporting period in accordance with SFAS144. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no
longer meet the Companys targeted return on investment. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development.
Changes in any of these factors would cause the Company to re-evaluate the likelihood of exercising its land options. 
75  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Each option contract contains a predetermined take-down schedule for the optioned land parcels.
However, in almost all instances, the Company is not required to purchase land in accordance with those take-down schedules. In substantially all instances, the Company has the right and ability to not exercise its option and forfeit its deposit
without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of its deposit and pre-acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, the Company does not consider the take-down price to be a firm
contractual obligation. When the Company permits an option to terminate or walks away from an option, it writes-off any unapplied deposit and pre-acquisition costs. For the year ended November30, 2006, the Company wrote-off $1522 million of
option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to 24,235 homesites under option that it does not intend to purchase, compared to $151 million in 2005.  In very limited cases, the land seller can enforce the take-down schedule by requiring the Company to exercise its option. The Company records the option
contract as a financing arrangement when required in accordance with SFAS No49, Accounting for Product Financing Arrangements, and records the optioned property and related take-down liability in its consolidated financial statements.
The Company evaluated all option contracts for land when
entered into or upon a reconsideration event and determined it was the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46R, the Company, if it is deemed to be
the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land. During 2006 and 2005, the effect of the consolidation of these option contracts was an increase of $5487 million and $5163
million, respectively, to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of November30, 2006 and 2005. This increase
was offset primarily by the Company exercising its options to acquire land under certain contracts previously consolidated under FIN 46R, resulting in a net increase in consolidated inventory not owned of $18 million. To reflect the purchase
price of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46R, the Company reclassified $807 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of
November30, 2006. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned represent the difference between the purchase price of the optioned land and the Companys cash deposits.  At November30, 2006 and 2005, the Companys exposure to loss
related to its option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of its non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs totaling $7859 million and $7416 million, respectively. Additionally, the Company posted $5534
million of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain option contracts as of November30, 2006.  19.Commitments and Contingent Liabilities  The Company is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the
disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase, development and
sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and certain unconsolidated entities
until the Company is ready to build homes on them. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At November30, 2006, the Company had access to acquire 189,279 homesites
through option contracts with third parties and agreements with unconsolidated entities in which the Company had investments. At November30, 2006, the Company had $7859 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to
certain of these homesites, which were included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.  At November30, 2006 and 2005, the Company had $1245 million and $693 million, respectively, of reserves recorded in accordance with SFAS
No5, Accounting for Contingencies, for income tax filing positions and related interest based on the Companys evaluation that uncertainty exists in sustaining the deductions. This reserve is included in other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. 
76  LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under

Rental expense for the
years ended November30, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $1406 million, $1160 million and $847 million, respectively.  The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in
the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $14 billion at November30, 2006. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with
estimated costs to complete of $18 billion. The Company does not believe there will be any draws upon these bonds, but if there were any, they would not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

Therefore, the sum of per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with per share amounts for the year.  22.Subsequent Event  On December29, 2006, the Company and LNR reached a definitive agreement to admit a new strategic partner into their LandSource joint venture See
Note 6 for additional information related to the LandSource joint venture. The transaction will result in a cash distribution to the Company and its current partner, LNR, of approximately $660 million each. For financial statement purposes, the
transaction is expected to generate earnings of approximately $500 million for the Company, of which approximately $125 million will be recognized at closing and a potential of approximately $375 million could be realized over future years. The new
partner will contribute cash and property with a combined value of approximately $900 million. Subsequent to the transaction, in addition to options the Company will have on certain LandSource assets, the Company will also have $153 million of
specific performance options on other LandSource assets. Following the contribution and refinancing, the Companys and LNRs interest in LandSource will be diluted to 19% each, and the new partner will be issued a 62% interest in
LandSource. The transaction is expected to close during the Companys first quarter of 2007.
