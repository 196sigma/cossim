Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc.

Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     In this annual report on Form10-K, Rigel, we, us and our refer to Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. common stock refers to Rigel
common stock, par value $0001 per share. 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Nature of operations and basis of presentation 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on June14, 1996. We are engaged in the discovery and development of a broad range of new small molecule
product candidates. On June24, 2003, we effected a one-for-nine reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock, after our stockholders approved the proposal for a
reverse split at our annual meeting of stockholders held on June20, 2003. As a result of the reverse stock split, each outstanding share of common stock automatically converted into
one-ninth of a share of common stock, with the par value of each share of common stock remaining at one tenth of one cent $0001 per share. Accordingly, common stock share and per share
amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the reverse stock split. Financial Statement Preparation 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Stock Award Plans 
We have elected to continue to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, or APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, to account for
employee stock options because the alternative fair value method of accounting prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or FAS, No123, as amended by FAS No148
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, the intrinsic value method of
accounting, no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. See Recent Accounting
Pronouncements below for a discussion of a recently issued FASB Statement related to stock-based compensation. 
Pro
forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan under the fair
value method prescribed by FAS123, as amended by FAS148. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: risk-free interest rates of 29%, 13% and 21%, respectively; volatility of 085, 100 and 085
respectively; an expected option life of five years; and no dividend yield. 
43  For
purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense over the vesting period of the options. Our pro forma information follows in
thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December 31 2004
2003
2002 Net lossas reported 56,255 41,197 37,030 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation determined under APB 25 2,135 957 955 Add: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under the fair value based method for all awards 7,332 3,066 3,391 Pro forma net loss 61,452 43,306 39,466 Basic and diluted net loss per common share As reported 312 362 741 Pro forma 340 380 790 Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities 
We consider all highly liquid investments in debt securities with a remaining maturity from the date of purchase of 90days or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and corporate debt securities. Our short-term investments include obligations of governmental agencies and corporate debt securities. By
policy, we limit the concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers. 
All
cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are
carried at fair value which approximates amortized cost at December31, 2004 and 2003. Unrealized gains losses are reported in stockholders' equity and included in other comprehensive income
loss. Fair value is estimated based on available market information. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. For the years ended December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, gross realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were not material. See Note4 for a summary of available-for-sale
securities at December31, 2004 and 2003. Fair value of financial instruments 
Financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and accrued compensation are carried at
cost or amortized cost, which management believes approximates fair value. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
All derivatives are required to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges must be adjusted to fair value
through earnings. If the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in
fair value of assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is 
44  recognized
in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. We do not hold derivative financial instruments and do no currently
engage in hedging activities. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease, whichever
is shorter. 
Revenue recognition 
We recognize revenue from our contract arrangements. Our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain
criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items. The
consideration we receive is allocated among
the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts
earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned. 
Non-refundable,
up-front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements, including technology access fees, are deferred
and recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement, generally the research term. 
Revenues
related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development funding periods for each
contract. Under these agreements, we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement. The payments received are not refundable and are generally
based on a contractual cost per full-time equivalent employee working on the project. Research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed
the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements. Deferred revenue may result if we were not to incur the required level of effort during a specific period in
comparison to funds received under the respective contracts. 
Milestones
are recognized pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of these specified at risk milestones. Royalties
are expected to be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured. 
Research and development 
Research and development expenses include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, consultants, research sponsored by us, allocated facility costs,
costs related to pre-clinical and clinical trials, and stock-based compensation expense. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred. Collaboration
agreements generally specify minimum levels of research effort required to be performed by us. 
45  Impairment of long-lived assets 
Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. 
Segment reporting 
We have determined that we operate in only one segment. 
Contingencies 
We are subject to claims related to the patent protection of certain of our technologies. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or
outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each
individual issue. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. 
Net loss per share 
Net loss per share has been computed according to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No128, Earnings Per Share, which requires disclosure
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, shares subject to repurchase, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per
share includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities. 
During
all periods presented, we had securities outstanding which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per share, as their effect would have been antidilutive. These outstanding securities consist of the following in thousands, except per share information: December 31 2004
2003
2002 Outstanding options 2,750 2,081 718 Warrants 92 1,725 128 Weighted average exercise price of options 1194 831 3123 Weighted average exercise price of warrants 2833 717 2484 Recent accounting pronouncements 
At its March2004 meeting, the EITF reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under EITF 03-01. The
consensus clarified the meaning of other-than-temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available-for-sale or
held-to-maturity under SFAS No115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities and to investments
accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. In September2004, the FASB delayed indefintely the recognition and measurement guidance to be applied to
other-than-temporary impairment evaluations; however the disclosure requirements remain 
46  effective
and have been adopted for our year ended December31, 2004. We will evaluate the effect, if any, of the recognition and measurement provision of EITF Issue 03-1 when final
guidance is released. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued Statement No123R, Share-Based Paymentan amendment of FASB Statement Nos.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. and 95, Statement of Cash Flows. SFAS123R
addresses the accounting for transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for aequity instruments of the company or bliabilities that are based on the
fair value of the company equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. SFAS123R eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using
APB 25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based
method, thereby requiring companies to recognize an expense for compensation cost related to share-based payment arrangements, including stock options and employee stock purchase plans. This statement
is required to be adopted by us beginning July1, 2005. The cumulative effect of adoption applied on a modified prospective basis would be measured and recognized beginning July1, 2005.
We are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light of SFAS123R related to our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Current estimates of
option values using the Black-Scholes method reflected in Note1 above may not be indicative of results from valuation methodologies ultimately adopted by us in compliance with
SFAS123R. 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS  Research agreements 
In December1998, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V., a division of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical and
Development, LLC to research and identify novel targets for drug discovery. At the time we entered into the contract, Johnson Johnson paid a one-time non-refundable,
non-creditable fee and provided support for research activities during the research period, which concluded in December2003. In addition to these fees, we also received various
milestones payments. Johnson Johnson remains obligated to pay us various milestones and royalties in the future if certain conditions are met. In
January1999, we entered into a two-year collaborative research agreement with PfizerInc. to discover and develop various molecular targets. Upon signing of
the agreement, Pfizer paid a one-time, nonrefundable, noncreditable fee. Under the terms of the contract, Pfizer provided support for research for two years. In 2001, Pfizer notified us
that it was electing to exercise its option to extend the funded research portion of the collaboration one additional year to January31, 2002 and then extended it again for one additional
month to February28, 2002. In February2002, the research phase of our collaboration with Pfizer concluded with Pfizer accepting a total of seven validated targets. In
January2005, we signed a second collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the development of inhaled products for the treatment of allergic asthma and other respiratory
diseases focusing on our small molecule compounds that inhibit Syk kinase. Pursuant to the terms of this collaboration, we received an upfront cash payment, and are eligible to receive
milestone payments and royalties on any future product sales. Pfizer made an equity investment in Rigel at a premium and will be responsible for the worldwide development and commercialization of any
resulting products. 
In
May1999, we entered into a broad collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, pursuant to which we and Novartis agreed to work on up to five different research programs to identify
various targets for 
47  drug
development. Two programs were initiated in 1999 while the third program to be conducted at Novartis was initiated on January1, 2000. In July2001, we expanded our collaboration
with Novartis with the initiation of our angiogenesis program, the fourth and final program in our Novartis collaboration as Novartis chose not to exercise its option to add a fifth project that was
to be conducted at Novartis. Pursuant to the expanded Novartis collaboration, we received a $40million up-front payment from Novartis, which was recognized as revenue ratably
through July2004. We currently have no programs with Novartis in the research phase, however Novartis remains obligated to provide payment for various milestones and royalties in the future if
certain conditions in the collaboration agreement are met. 
In
August2002, we signed an agreement for the establishment of a collaboration with Daiichi to pursue research related to a specific target from a novel class of drug targets
called ligases that control cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation. Per the agreement, the research phase of this three-year collaboration is set to expire in
August2005. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Daiichi paid us $09million at the time we entered into the agreement, two milestone payments totaling $37million,
is obligated to pay us ongoing research support through July2005 and may become obligated to pay us certain other milestones payments in the future. In addition, we are entitled to receive
royalties on any commercialized products to emerge from the collaboration. Under terms of the agreement, we retain the rights to co-develop and co-promote products resulting
from this collaboration in North America while Daiichi retains co-development and promotion rights in the remainder of the world. 
In
November2004, we entered into a broad collaboration agreement with Merck Co.,Inc. to investigate ubiquitin ligases, a new class of drug target, to find
treatments for cancer and potentially other diseases. At the time we entered into the agreement, we received an initial cash payment of $76M and funding for our research scientists for two and a half
years. We are recognizing the upfront payment ratably over the two and a half year term of the research agreement. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments for preclinical and clinical
events in the future. Merck is responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of any resulting compounds and will pay Rigel royalties on future product sales, if any. The collaboration is
based on a number of new targets designated by Merck and do not include our current ligase targets. In addition, we may nominate our own targets for potential inclusion in the collaboration.

than twelve months. As of December31, 2004, 32 individual securities were in an unrealized loss position. As of December31, 2003, 16 individual securities were in an unrealized loss
position. 
Investment Grade Debt Securities.Our investments in investment grade debt securities consist primarily of investments in
federal agency securities and corporate bonds and notes. The unrealized losses on our investments in investment grade debt securities were caused by interest rate increases. Due to the fact that the
decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the severity and duration of the unrealized losses were not significant, we considered these
unrealized losses to be temporary at December31, 2004. 
50  5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 
Property and equipment consists of the following in thousands: Years Ended
December 31 2004
2003 Laboratory and office equipment 13,804 17,448 Construction in progress 288 Total property and equipment 14,092 17,448 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization 11,279 13,904 Property and equipment, net 2,813 3,544 During
2004, we wrote-off $4,900,000 of assets at their original acquisition cost and related accumulated depreciation of 4,870,000 for assets that are no longer in use. We
recorded a loss on disposal of property and equipment of $30,000. 
At
December31, 2004 and 2003, equipment under capital leases was approximately 59million and $87million, respectively. Depreciation expense was
$22million, $26million, and $32million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No amortization expense was incurred for the year ended
December31, 2004. Amortization expense was $24,000 and $1,710,000 for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
6. LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS 
At December31, 2004, future minimum lease payments and obligations under all noncancelable leases were as follows in thousands: Capital
Leases
Operating
Leases 2005 1,452 12,354 2006 576 12,795 2007 258 13,512 2008 13,945 2009 14,399 2010 and thereafter 114,630 Total minimum payments required 2,286 181,635 Less amount representing interest 184 Present value of future lease payments 2,102 Less current portion 1,321 Noncurrent obligations under capital leases 781 Our
current facilities were constructed as a build-to-suit facility. Under the original lease for this new facility we were obligated to fund approximately
$180million of the total tenant improvements. In October2002 we amended this original lease agreement, prior to the completion of the construction of the facility and commencement of
the lease to provide for a delay of the rent commencement date until February1, 2003 and an increase in the tenant improvement allowance from the lessor to cover all the tenant improvement
construction obligations on the facility. The landlord owns 100% of these 
51  tenant
improvements. The lease was also amended to increase the future rental commitments to compensate for the delay of the rent commencement and the increase in the tenant improvement allowance.
Since the amendment was considered a material change to the original lease, we revisited the proper accounting treatment for this lease per FAS13 and again determined the lease to be an
operating lease. We moved into the new facilities during February2003. During May2004, we initiated a sublease of approximately 15,000 square feet of our premises to a tenant for a
period of two years. The operating minimum lease payments above are reflective of the new sublease income stream. On January31, 2005 we entered into another amendment with the landlord to
decrease the contractual rental commitments in 2005 by approximately $10million. The operating lease payment schedule above reflects this amendment. 
Rent
expense under all operating leases amounted to approximately $140million, $135million and $19million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. 
In
August2000, we entered into an equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $50million. We only utilized $41million of the facility before the
drawdown period expired. The lease period was for four years. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging from 106% to 146%. This line has a
bargain purchase buyout provision of $10. As of December31, 2004, the remaining principal balance was approximately $145,000. 
In
January2002, we entered into an additional equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $20million. This line was fully utilized in August2002.
The lease period was for 37months. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of the draw down with the interest rates ranging from 115% to 117%. This line has a buyout provision of
approximately 10% of the original utilized line amount. As of December31, 2004, the remaining principal balance was approximately $452,000. In
December2002, we entered into an additional equipment lease line agreement for an aggregate total of $20million. We originally had the ability to draw down on this
line until December2003, but this date was extended to March2004 through an agreement reached in 2003. Only $14million of this line was utilized before the drawdown period
expired. The lease period is for three years. The interest on the lease is fixed at the time of any draw down and equates to approximately 105%. This line has a buyout provision of either the
fair-market value of the equipment or 10% of the original utilized line amount. As of December31, 2004, the remaining principal balance was approximately $778,000. In
April2004, our equipment credit line under an original master agreement originally signed in August2000 was extended to create an additional total borrowing limit of
$20million. As of December31, 2004, $755,000 of this extended amount has been utilized. We have the ability to draw down through March2005. The lease period will be for three
years. The interest rate on the lease is fixed at drawdown and ranges from 92% to 99%. Each line has a bargain purchase buyout provision of $101. As of December31, 2004, the remaining
principal balance was approximately $727,000. Obligations
under all leases are secured by the assets financed under the leases. 
7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
Common stock 
In January2002, we issued 777,778 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to certain institutional investors at a price of $4050 per share
under a shelf registration statement. We received net proceeds of approximately $294million after deducting commissions and offering costs. In 
52  February2002,
we issued 51,678 shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a certain institutional investor at a price of $3870 per share under a shelf registration statement.
We received net proceeds of approximately $18million after deducting commissions and offering costs. 
In
June2003, we completed a private placement with net proceeds of $450million led by MPM Capital and included Frazier Healthcare, Alta Partners and HBM BioVentures. In
the private placement, we issued 7,986,110 shares of our common stock at a price of $576 per share plus warrants described below. In
June2003, we initiated a rights offering pursuant to which non-transferable rights to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,736,111 shares of our common stock at a
purchase price of $576 per share were offered to our stockholders of record as of April29, 2003, other than certain stockholders affiliated with the investors in the private placement
completed on June26, 2003. Each such stockholder of record received one basic subscription right to purchase 04508 of a share of Rigel common stock at
$576 per share for each share owned as of the record date. By July25, 2003, the expiration of the rights offering period, our stockholders had elected to purchase an aggregate of 1,616,705
shares of our common stock for net proceeds to us of $91million. The shares were issued to the participating stockholders on July31, 2003. In
February2004, we completed a follow-on offering in which we sold 2,850,000 shares and selling stockholders sold 315,000 shares of our common stock at a price to
the public of $2000 per share. In March2004, the underwriters of the follow-on offering exercised their option to purchase an additional 316,750 shares of our common stock, to
cover over-allotments. A total of 3,481,750 shares of our common stock were sold in the offering, of which 3,135,075 were sold by us and 346,675 were sold by selling stockholders. We
received net proceeds of approximately $583million from the sale of shares offered by us, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and related expenses. We did not receive any proceeds
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 
Warrants 
In conjunction with the facilities lease entered into in June1998, we issued three warrants to the lessor to purchase an aggregate of 16,666 shares of
common stock at an exercise price of $1026 per share. The warrants are outstanding as of December31, 2004 and are exercisable at any time up to November28, 2007, the seventh
anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering. 
In
conjunction with the facilities lease entered into in May2001, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase 16,666 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8021
per share, a 15% premium to market at the time of issuance. This warrant was outstanding as of December31, 2004 and will expire on May16, 2006. The fair market value of this warrant,
as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $683,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term assets and is being amortized into expense over the life
of the lease. As of December31, 2004, approximately $595,000 remained to be amortized over the life of the lease. 
In
conjunction with the equipment lease line executed in January2002, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase 2,645 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
$3780 per share. This warrant was outstanding as of December31, 2004 and will expire on January31, 2007. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined by the Black-Scholes
valuation model, was approximately $66,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term assets and is being amortized into expense over 
53  the
payment period of the equipment lease line. As of December31, 2004, approximately $49,000 remained to be amortized over the life of the lease. 
In
conjunction with the equipment lease line executed in July2002, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase 15,432 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2430
per share. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $251,000. This amount was completely expensed in 2002 in conjunction with the
termination of the line. These warrants were net exercised in 2004 and resulted in the issuance of 1,086 shares of common stock. 
In
conjunction with the amendment of our master lease agreement for our 1180 Veterans Blvd. facility entered into in October2002, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase
55,555 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1773 per share. This warrant was outstanding as of December31, 2004 and will expire on October18, 2007. The fair market
value of this warrant, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $565,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term assets and is being amortized
into expense over the life of the lease. As of December31, 2004, approximately $493,000 remained to be amortized over the life of the lease. 
In
conjunction with the equipment lease line executed in December2002, we issued a warrant to the lender to purchase 20,768 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
$963 per share. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $136,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term
assets and is being amortized into expense over the payment period of the equipment lease line. These warrants were net exercised in 2004 and resulted in the issuance of 11,343 shares of common stock. 
In
conjunction with the financing completed in June2003, we issued warrants to the investors to purchase an additional 1,597,221 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
of $576 per share. The fair value of these warrants, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $110million. This amount has been allocated within Additional
paid-in capital in our financial statements. A total of 1,041,666 of these warrants were cash exercised in 2004 resulting in proceeds to us of approximately $60million. The
remaining 555,555 warrant shares were net exercised in 2004 and resulted in the issuance of 415,687 shares of common stock. 
Stock option plans 
In January2000, we adopted the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2000 Plan, which was approved in March2000 by our stockholders. The 2000 Plan is an
amendment and restatement of the 1997 Stock Option Plan. Under the 2000 Plan, incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and shares of common stock may be granted to our employees, directors
and consultants. In July2001, we adopted the 2001 Non-Officer Equity Incentive Plan, or 2001 Plan. Under the 2001 Plan, which was not approved by our stockholders, nonstatutory
stock options may be granted to our employees and consultants. In April2003, our board of directors approved an amendment to the 2000 Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders
at our annual meeting in June2003, to imerge the 2001 Plan into the 2000 Plan and to terminate the 2001 Plan, iiincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under
the 2000 Plan including the available reserve from the merging of the 2001 Plan by 1,600,000 shares of common stock, and iiiadd an evergreen feature that provides for automatic annual
increases in the total number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. Options originally granted under our 2000 Plan and 2001 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant.
The option price of each incentive stock option shall be at least 100% of the fair value on the 
54  date
of grant, and the option price for each nonstatutory stock option shall be not less than 85% of the fair value on the date of grant, as determined by the board of directors. Options may be
granted with different vesting terms from time to time, not to exceed five years from the date of grant. As of December31, 2004, a total of 414,872 shares of common stock are authorized for
issuance under the 2000 Plan. 
In
August2000, we adopted the 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, or Directors' Plan, which was approved in September2000 by our stockholders.
Under the original plan, each non-employee director who becomes a director of Rigel would be automatically granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 2,222 shares of common stock on
the date on which such person first becomes a director. At each board meeting immediately following each annual meeting of stockholders, beginning with the board meeting following the 2001 Annual
Stockholders' Meeting, each non-employee director would automatically be granted a nonstatutory option to purchase 556 shares of common stock. In April2003, our board of directors
approved an amendment to the Directors' Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting in June2003, to iincrease the number of shares authorized for
issuance under the Directors' Plan by 66,667 shares of common stock, iiincrease the size of the initial grants to 6,667 shares of common stock, and iiiincrease the size of the
annual grant to 1,667 shares of common stock. The exercise price of options under the Directors' Plan will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The maximum term
of the options granted under the Directors' Plan is ten years. All grants under the Directors' Plan will vest monthly over two years from date of grant. The Directors' Plan will terminate in
September2009, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the Directors' Plan. As of December31, 2004, a total of 68,177 shares of common stock are authorized for
issuance under the Directors' Plan. 
In
June2003, we initiated an offer to exchange options to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than $900 per share currently outstanding
under the 2000 Plan, the 2001 Plan and the Directors' Plan, for replacement options to purchase shares of our common stock to be granted under the 2000 Plan. There were outstanding eligible options to
purchase an aggregate of 367,961 shares of our common stock as of June26, 2003. Only officers, employees not on certain leaves of absence, consultants and non-employee members of
our board of directors as of June27, 2003, who continued to be employed or providing services through the offer expiration date of July25, 2003, were eligible to participate in the
offer. We offered to conduct the exchange with respect to eligible options on a one-for-one basis. On July28, 2003, we accepted for cancellation options to purchase an
aggregate of 344,207 shares of our common stock. On July28, 2003, we granted replacement options to purchase an aggregate of 344,207 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $920
per share, the fair market value on the date of the grant. Subject to the continuation of the optionholders' employment, service as a consultant or service as a non-employee member of our
board of directors, the replacement options will vest as follows: one-fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the six-month anniversary of the date
of grant; one-fifth of the shares covered by the replacement options will vest on the twelve-month anniversary of the date of grant; and three-fifths of the shares covered by the
replacement options will vest in 24 equal monthly installments over the following two years. The replacement options will expire, at the latest, on the day three years and five business days after the
date of grant if they have not been forfeited earlier due to the optionholders' termination of employment, service as a consultant or service as a non-employee member of our board of
directors. All replacement options, as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange, are being treated for financial reporting purposes 
55  as
variable awards. Therefore, we are recording a non-cash charge, generally for the intrinsic value of the options as they vest using the graded vesting method, reflecting increases and
decreases down to, but not below, the exercise price in the price of our common stock in compensation expense in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not
exchanged. We expect to continue to reflect increases and decreases in the price of our common stock in our statement of operations with respect to these options until they are exercised, forfeited or
terminated. The higher the market value of our common stock, the greater the compensation expense. For the year ended December31, 2004, we recorded a non-cash compensation charge
of $19million related to all options eligible for the replacement until the options are exercised, forfeited, or terminated. For the year ended December31, 2003, we recorded a
non-cash compensation charge of $11million related to all options eligible for the replacement. We are currently evaluating option valuation methodologies and assumptions in light
of SFAS123R related to our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans.

granted 30,000 shares of common stock options to consultants for services in 2004. We granted 100 shares of common stock options to consultants for services in 2003. We also cancelled
and regranted 16,636 common stock options to consultants in association with the repricing on July28, 2003. We granted 7,222 common stock options to consultants in exchange for services in
2002. We recognized stock-based compensation for revaluation of consultant options of $04million and $02million for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
We recognized stock-based compensation recovery for revaluation of consultant options of $02million for the year ended December31, 2002. We
recorded $58,000 of deferred stock compensation for the year ended December31, 2004. We recorded no deferred stock compensation with respect to options granted to employees
for the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002. The amount recorded in 2004 related to an option grant to a certain executive officer that was modified to reduce the vesting term. This amount
has been reflected as a component of stockholders' equity, and the deferred expense is being amortized to operations over the remaining vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method.
As a result of our reduction in force on January31, 2003, we recognized approximately $599,000 of stock-based compensation recovery associated with the unvested and cancelled options of the
terminated employees which had previously been recognized under the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization. We amortized deferred stock compensation of $01million 06million and $17million for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At December31, 2004, we had a total of $56,000 remaining to be amortized
over the remaining vesting periods of the stock options. 
2000 employee stock purchase plan 
In August2000, we adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or Purchase Plan, which was approved in September2000 by our stockholders. In
April2003, our board of directors approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders at our annual meeting in June2003, to
iincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan by 66,667 shares of common stock, and iichange the evergreen feature of the plan. The amendment
provides that the increase in the number of shares reserved automatically pursuant to the evergreen feature will be equal to the least of 1% of the outstanding shares on the date of the annual
increase, 88,889 shares or such amount as may be determined by the board. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined 
57  offering
periods. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first day of the offering or 85% of the fair market value
of our common stock on the purchase date. The initial offering period commenced on the effective date of our initial public offering. We issued 93,529, 37,112 and 19,273 shares of common stock during
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, pursuant to the Purchase Plan at an average price of $876 per share, $845 per share, and $1863 per share in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For 2004, 2003 and
2002, the weighted average fair value of stock issued under the Purchase Plan was $655, $433 and $168, respectively. A total of 44,444 shares of our common stock were initially reserved for
issuance under the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the Purchase Plan on each anniversary date of the effective date
of the offering. The number of shares reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan was increased by 88,888, 66,667 and 44,444 during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
Reserved shares 
As of December31, 2004, we had reserved shares of common stock for future issuance as follows: December 31,

3,447,798 8. INCOME TAXES 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets are as follows: December 31 2004
2003 Deferred tax assets Net operating loss carryforwards 60,462 46,440 Research and development credits 7,637 6,425 Capitalized research and development expenses 9,749 7,643 Other, net 9,140 2,417 Total deferred tax assets 86,988 62,925 Valuation allowance 86,988 62,925 Net deferred tax assets Realization
of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully
offset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $241million, $185million and $182million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 
58  Included
in the valuation allowance balance at December31, 2004 is $16million related to the exercise of stock options which are not reflected as an expense for
financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, any future reduction in the valuation allowance relating to this amount will be credited directly to equity and not reflected as an income tax benefit in the
statement of operations. 
As
of December31, 2004, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $1759million, which expire beginning in the year 2011
and federal research and development tax credits of approximately $112million, which will begin to expire in 2013. Utilization
of the net operating loss and credit may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 IRC
and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that Rigel
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Rigel Pharmaceutical,Inc. management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are 
60  recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceutical,Inc. as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004 of Rigel
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. and our report dated March10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo
