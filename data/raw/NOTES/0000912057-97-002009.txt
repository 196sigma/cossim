INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cameron Ashley Building 
Products, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cameron
Ashley Building Products, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1996 and 1995,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 1996. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Cameron Ashley Building
Products, Inc. and subsidiaries at October 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts 
of Cameron Ashley Building Products, Inc. the Company, and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries, Wm. Cameron & Co. Cameron and Ashley Aluminum, Inc. 
Ashley.
The Company distributes building products to independent dealers 
lumberyards and hardware stores, professional builders, contractors and 
mass merchandisers throughout the United States and in Mexico and Canada. 
Products distributed by the Company are used primarily in new residential 
construction and home improvement, remodeling and repair work, as well as in 
commercial and industrial applications.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CASH EQUIVALENTS. All highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of 
three months or less when purchased are classified as cash equivalents.
INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of last-in, first-out 
LIFO cost or market. Included in inventory cost are costs directly 
associated with the fabrication of the Company products.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is recorded 
at cost. Costs associated with major additions are capitalized and 
depreciated. Upon disposal, the cost of properties and related accumulated 
depreciation are removed from the accounts, with gains and losses reflected 
in earnings.
Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the 
depreciable assets. Assets are generally depreciated on the straight-line 
method over the estimated service lives of the related assets, which range 
from 3 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS. Intangibles consist primarily of noncompete 
agreements, which are recorded at cost and are amortized over periods of 
three to five years, the contractual term of the agreements, and goodwill, 
which is primarily amortized over 25 years.
REVENUE RECOGNITION. Sales are recorded at the time merchandise is 
shipped and are reported net of estimated returns and allowances.
INCOME TAXES. Income taxes are provided for using the asset and 
liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax 
consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement 
carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by 
applying enacted statutory tax rates. The effect on deferred taxes of a 
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the 
enactment date. The Company periodically evaluates the collectibility of 
deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance for the portion of 
such assets not considered realizable.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.  The Company is primarily engaged in the 
distribution of building products throughout the United States. The Company 
grants credit to customers, substantially all of whom are dependent upon the 
construction economic sector. The Company continuously evaluates its 
customers' financial condition but does not generally require collateral. 
The concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is 
limited due to the Company large customer base located throughout the 
United States. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon the expected collectibility of its accounts receivable, and credit 
losses have been within management expectations.              
-23   USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimated.
NET INCOME PER SHARE. Net income per share is computed by dividing net 
income by the weighted average shares outstanding. Weighted average shares 
used in the primary calculation include the actual shares outstanding and the 
net additional shares which would be issuable upon the exercise of stock 
options and tax benefits, assuming that the Company used the proceeds to 
purchase additional shares at estimated fair value during the year. Fully 
diluted income per share is not presented, because such amount differs by 
less than 3% from the primary calculation.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. Statement of Financial Account Standards No. 
121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived 
Assets to be Disposed Of SFAS No. 121 establishes accounting standards for 
the impairment of long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and 
goodwill related to those assets to be held and used and for long-lived 
assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of. SFAS No. 121 
requires the review of long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles 
for impairment. If an impairment has occurred and it is determined that the 
carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable, an impairment loss will 
be recognized as measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the 
assets exceeds the fair value of the asset. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 121
at the beginning of fiscal 1997. The Company does not anticipate adoption of
SFAS No. 121 will have a material impact on its results of operations or 
financial position.  
The Company will adopt SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based 
Compensation during fiscal 1997. Management expects to continue to measure 
compensation costs using APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees, and will therefore include certain disclosures in the notes to 
the financial statements for all awards granted after November 1, 1996. The 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a significant effect on 
the financial statements of the Company.
RECLASSIFICATIONS. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to 
conform to current-year presentation.
3. ACQUISITIONS
Over the past three years, the Company has acquired certain net assets 
and operations of various building materials distributors. All of these 
transactions were accounted for as purchases; therefore, results of 
operations of the Company include the operations of the business subsequent 
to their acquisitions.
In fiscal 1994, five businesses were acquired at a total net cost of 
$292 million. During fiscal 1995, seven businesses were acquired at a total 
net cost of $348 million. During fiscal 1996, five businesses were acquired 
at a total net cost of $248 million. A pro forma results of operations for 
these acquisitions are not presented due to the immaterial effect on 
historical results.
4. INVENTORIES
The Company values its inventories using the LIFO method. Had the 
Company used the first-in, first-out FIFO method, inventories would have 
been approximately $2,227,000 and $3,508,000 higher at October 31, 1996 and 
1995, respectively. Under FIFO, income from operations for the year ended 
October 31, 1996 would have been lower by approximately $1,281,000, and 
income from operations for the years ended October 31, 1995 and 1994 would 
have been higher by approximately $1,299,000 and $806,000, respectively.

In April 1996, the Company amended the credit facility with NationsBank 
and other banks collectively referred to as NationsBank. The financing 
agreement with NationsBank covers a revolving line of credit up to $75 
million. The financing agreement restricts distributions to stockholders to 
50% of net income, issuance of stock by the Company subsidiaries, the 
assumption of debt and liens by the Company subsidiaries, and requires 
compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants. The obligations of 
the Company to NationsBank are unsecured. The NationsBank revolving credit 
note also requires the Company to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the 
unused balance ranging from 02% to 03% on the difference between the 
revolving commitment of $75 million and revolving advances outstanding.
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt during the fiscal years subsequent
