Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent
Auditors Board of Directors and Shareholders of Polaris
Industries Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Polaris Industries Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2002 and the related consolidated statements
of income, shareholders equity and comprehensive income,
and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated
financial statements of Polaris Industries Inc. and subsidiaries
as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and for the two years
then ended, were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations and whose reports dated January23, 2002
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We conducted our audit in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Polaris Industries Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2002 and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. As discussed above, the consolidated financial
statements of Polaris Industries Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 2001 and 2000, and for the two years then ended, were
audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As
described in Note1, these consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional
disclosures required by Financial Accounting Standard
No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
which was adopted by the Company as of January1, 2002. As
further described in Note1, these financial statements
have also been revised to include reclassifications required by
Emerging Issues Task Force No01-09 and No00-25 and
reclassification of income from financial services from
non-operating income to operating income. We have audited the
disclosures and reclassifications in Note1 and, in our
opinion, the disclosures and reclassifications for 2001 and 2000
in Note1 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to
audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with
respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express
an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

19 Table of Contents The accompanying financial statements of the
Company as of December31, 2001 and for the periods ended
December31, 2001 and 2000 were audited by Arthur Andersen
LLP Andersen, who were dismissed by the Company as
its independent auditors on March15, 2002. Due to
Andersens well-publicized change in circumstances since it
issued the following report, the Company has not been able to
obtain either a re-issuance of the report by Andersen or
Andersens consent to the inclusion of the report in this
Form10-K as would normally be required by the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission SEC. The SEC
has provided certain guidance to Andersens former audit
clients, including Rule2-02 of RegulationS-X, which
provides for the inclusion of a copy of the following report in
this Form10-K and Rule437a under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, which
relieves the Company of its obligation to file Andersens
consent with this Form10-K. That guidance from the SEC
also requires that we inform you that under the circumstances
you may not be able to recover against Andersen under
Section11 of the Exchange Act in the event that the
Companys financial statements that were audited by
Andersen contained material misstatements or
omissions. Certain financial information for each of the
two years in the period ended December31, 2001 was not
reviewed by Andersen and includes 1reclassifications to
conform to the Companys fiscal 2002 financial statement
presentation, and 2reclassifications and additional
disclosures to conform with new accounting pronouncements and
SEC rules and regulations issued during fiscal 2002. Report of Independent Public Accountants To Polaris Industries Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Polaris Industries Inc. a Minnesota
corporation and Subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and
2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders equity and comprehensive income and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2001. These financial statements are the
responsibility of Polaris management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Polaris Industries Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and 2000, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2001, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

The accompanying footnotes are an integral part
of these consolidated statements. 24 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Note 1:Organization and Significant
Accounting Policies Polaris Industries Inc. Polaris or
the Company a Minnesota corporation, and its
subsidiaries, are engaged in a single industry segment
consisting of the design, engineering, manufacturing and
marketing of innovative, high-quality, high-performance
motorized products for recreation and utility use, including
all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, motorcycles and personal
watercraft. Polaris products, together with related parts,
garments and accessories are sold worldwide through a network of
dealers, distributors and its subsidiaries located in the United
States, Canada, France, Great Britain, Australia, Norway
andSweden. Basis of presentation:
The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Polaris and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Income from
financial services which was previously reported as
non-operating income is now reported as a component of operating
income to better reflect income from ongoing operations of which
financial services has a significant impact. This
reclassification has no impact on previously reported net income
or shareholdersequity. Use of estimates:
The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Ultimate results could differ from those estimates. Cash equivalents:
Polaris considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days
or less to be cash equivalents and are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value. Such investments have consisted
principally of commercial paper and money market
mutualfunds. Fair value of financial instruments:
Except as noted, the carrying value of
all financial instruments approximates their fair value. Allowance for doubtful accounts:
Polaris financial exposure to
collection of accounts receivable is limited due to its
agreements with certain finance companies. For receivables not
serviced through these finance companies, the Company provides a
reserve for doubtful accounts based on historical rates and
trends. This reserve is adjusted periodically as information
about specific accounts becomes available. Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost first-in, first-out method or market. The major
components of inventories are as follows inthousands

Property and equipment:
Property and equipment is stated at
cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of the respective assets, ranging
from 10-40years for buildings and improvements and from
1-7years for equipment and tooling. Fully depreciated
tooling is eliminated from the accounting records annually. Goodwill and other assets:
Effective January1, 2002, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS142 Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. Statement 142 prohibits the amortization of
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
Statement 142 requires that these 25 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued assets be reviewed for impairment at least
annually. An impairment charge is recognized only when the
calculated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill,
is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed an
analyses as of January1, 2002 and December31, 2002.
The results of the analysis indicated that no goodwill
impairment existed as of January1, 2002 and
December31, 2002. In accordance with SFAS142 the
Company will complete an impairment analysis on an
annualbasis. Goodwill net of accumulated amortization was
$24,267,000 at December31, 2002 and $23,541,000 at
December31,2001. Accumulated amortization was
$11,119,000 at both December31, 2002 and 2001. As required by SFAS142, intangibles with
finite lives continue to be amortized. Included in intangible
assets are patents and customer lists. Intangible assets before
accumulated amortization were $4,095,000 at December31,
2002 and $4,123,000 at December31, 2001. Accumulated
amortization was $3,427,000 at December31, 2002 and
$3,230,000 at December31, 2001. The net value of
intangible assets is included as a component of Intangible and
Other Assets in the accompanying consolidated
balancesheets. A reconciliation of reported net income adjusted
to reflect the adoption of SFAS142 if effective in the
prior years is provided below in thousands

Research and Development Expenses:
Polaris records research and
development expenses in the period in which they are incurred as
a component of operating expenses. In the periods ended
December31, 2002, 2001, and 2000 Polaris incurred
$45,550,000, $35,708,000 and $32,360,000 respectively. Shipping and Handling Costs:
Polaris records shipping and handling
costs as a component of cost of sales at the time the product
isshipped. Product warranties:
Polaris provides a limited warranty
for ATVs for a period of six months and for a period of one year
for its snowmobiles, motorcycles and PWC products. Polaris
provides longer warranties in certain non-U.S.geographical
markets as determined by local regulations and market
conditions. Polaris standard warranties require the
Company or its dealers to repair or replace defective product
during such warranty period at no cost to the consumer. The
warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the
dealer or distributor based on managements best estimate
using historical rates and trends. Adjustments to the warranty
reserve are made from time to time as actual claims become known
in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle
future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance
sheetdate. Sales promotions and incentives:
Polaris generally provides for
estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses, which are
recognized as a sales reduction, at the time of sale to the
dealer or distributor. Examples of sales promotion and incentive
programs include dealer and consumer rebates, volume discounts,
retail financing programs and sales associate incentives. Sales
promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current
programs and historical rates for each product line. Actual
results may differ from these estimates if 26 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued market conditions dictate the need to enhance or
reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer
usage rate varies from historical trends. Historically, sales
promotion and incentive expenses have been within the
Companys expectations and differences have not been
material. Dealer holdback programs:
Polaris provides dealer incentive
programs whereby at the time of shipment Polaris withholds an
amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the
product. Polaris records these amounts as a liability on the
consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid.
Payments are made to dealers twice each year, in February and
August subject to previously established criteria. Polaris has
recorded accrued liabilities of $73,651,000 and
$69,996,000million for dealer holdback programs in the
consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Foreign currency translation:
Polaris entities in Canada,
Australia and New Zealand use the U.S.dollar as their
functional currency. Assets and liabilities for these foreign
subsidiaries are re-measured in U.S.dollars at their
historical exchange rates. Translation gains and losses from
re-measurement of assets and liabilities that have the
U.S.dollar as the functional currency are reflected in the
results of operations. Polaris subsidiaries in France,
Great Britain, Norway and Sweden use the local currencies as
their functional currency. Assets and liabilities for these
foreign subsidiaries are translated at the foreign exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Translation gains and
losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss in the equity section of the balance sheet
for the subsidiaries in France, Great Britain, Sweden,
andNorway. Revenue recognition:
Revenues are recognized at the time of
shipment to the dealer or distributor. Product returns, whether
in the normal course of business or resulting from repossession
under its customer financing program See Note2, have not
been material. Polaris provides for estimated sales promotion
expenses which are recognized as a reduction of sales when
products are sold to the dealer or distributor customer. Major supplier:
During 2002, 2001, and 2000, purchases
of engines and related components totaling 10, 12 and
15percent respectively of Polaris cost of sales were
from a single Japanese supplier. Polaris has agreed with the
supplier to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange
rate between the U.S.dollar and the Japaneseyen. Stock-based employee compensation:
Polaris accounts for all stock based
compensation plans in accordance with the provision of APB
Opinion No25, under which compensation costs of
$16,212,000, $15,455,000, and $11,820,000, were recorded in
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Had compensation costs for
these plans been recorded at fair value consistent with the
methodology prescribed by SFASNo123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
Polaris net income and net income per share would have
been reduced to the following pro forma amounts

hedging activities
SFASNo133: Polaris
adopted SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, on January1,
2001. SFASNo133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset
or liability measured at its fair value. SFASNo133
requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria
are met, and requires that a company must formally document,
designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that
receive hedge accounting. The effect of adopting SFAS133
was to establish the fair market value of certain interest rate
swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts. The cumulative
effect of adoption was an unrealized loss of $2,544,000, net of
tax, and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of
shareholders equity and comprehensive income. As of
December31, 2002 and 2001 the after tax net unrealized
loss of the derivative instruments were $838,000 and $5,218,000
respectively. Interest rate swap agreement:
Polaris has one interest rate swap
agreement on $18,000,000 of long term debt. The swap agreement,
expiring in 2007, has been designated as and meets the criteria
as a cash flow hedge. Initial adoption of SFAS133 resulted
in the recording of a liability for the fair value of this swap
agreement of $1,283,000 during 2001. The fair value of this swap
agreement on December31, 2002 and 2001 was $3,366,000 and
$1,977,000, respectively, which was recorded as a liability in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign exchange contracts:
Polaris enters into foreign exchange
contracts to manage currency exposures of certain of its
purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies and
transfers of funds from its Canadian subsidiary. Polaris does
not use any financial contracts for trading purposes. The
contracts have been designated as and meet the criteria for cash
flow hedges. At January1, 2001, Polaris had open Japanese
yen foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling
$64,997,000 U.S.dollars. Initial adoption of SFAS133
resulted in the recording of a liability of $2,601,000 for the
fair value of the foreign exchange contracts. At
December31, 2002, Polaris had open Japanese yen foreign
exchange currency contracts with notional amounts totaling
$41,006,000 US dollars maturing in 2003 and had a net asset fair
market value of $1,788,000. At December31, 2002 Polaris
had open Canadian dollar foreign exchange currency contracts
with notional amounts totaling $14,283,000 maturing in 2003 and
had a net asset fair market value of $269,000. Comprehensive income:
Comprehensive income reflects the
change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from
transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner
sources. For the Company, comprehensive income represents net
income adjusted for foreign currency translation adjustments 28 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued and the gain or loss on derivative instruments.
The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income in the
accompanying consolidated statements of shareholders equity and
comprehensive income. New accounting
pronouncements: Polaris implemented
two new accounting pronouncements during the first quarter 2002.
Floor plan financing expenses that previously were included in
selling and marketing expenses are now recorded as an offset to
sales to comply with the requirements of Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue EITF01-09. Cooperative advertising expenses
that previously were included in selling and marketing expenses
are now recorded in cost of sales to comply with the
requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
EITF00-25. Certain amounts in the 2001 and 2000 periods
presented have been reclassified to conform to the new
requirements. These changes had no impact on previously reported
net income or shareholders equity. In December 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued the Statement of Financial Accounts
Standards SFASNo148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure an amendment of
SFASNo123. This statement provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. This statement also amends the disclosure
requirements of SFASNo123 and APB Opinion
No28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. The Company has implemented the annual
reporting requirements for SFASNo148 at
December31, 2002 and will implement disclosure
requirements for condensed financial statements for interim
periods after January1, 2003. The Company has determined
at this time to continue to account for all stock-based employee
compensation plans under APB opinion No25. Note2:Financing Bank financing:
Polaris is a party to two unsecured bank lines of credit
arrangements under which it may borrow up to $250,000,000 until
maturity. Interest is charged at rates based on LIBOR or
prime. A $150,000,000 line of credit expires on
June14, 2004, and a $100,000,000 364-day line of credit
expires on June12, 2003 at which time the outstanding
balances are due. The arrangements contain various restrictive
covenants which limit investments, acquisitions and
indebtedness. The arrangements also require Polaris to maintain
certain financial ratios including a minimum tangible net worth,
minimum interest coverage and a maximum leverage ratio. Polaris
was in compliance with each of the covenants as of
December31, 2002. The following summarizes activity under

Polaris has entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates.
The effect of this agreement is to fix the interest rate at
721percent for $18,000,000 of any borrowing until July
2007. The fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability
of $3,366,000 as of December31, 2002. Letters of credit:
At December31, 2002, Polaris had open letters of credit
totaling approximately $5,306,000. The amounts outstanding are
reduced as inventory purchases pertaining to the contracts are
received. Dealer financing
programs: Certain finance companies,
including Polaris Acceptance, an affiliate see note6,
provide floor plan financing to dealers on the purchase of
Polaris products. The amount financed by North American dealers
under these arrangements at December31, 2002, was
approximately $665,000,000. 29 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Polaris has agreed to repurchase products
repossessed by the finance companies up to an annual maximum of
15percent of the average month-end balances outstanding
during the prior calendar year. Polaris financial exposure
under these arrangements is limited to the difference between
the amount paid to the finance companies for repurchases and the
amount received on the resale of the repossessed product. No
material losses have been incurred under these agreements during
the periods presented. As a part of its marketing program,
Polaris contributes to the cost of dealer financing up to
certain limits and subject to certain conditions. Such
expenditures are included as an offset to sales in the
accompanying statements of income. Note3:Income Taxes Components of Polaris provision for income

of income. Under the terms of the agreement, either party has
the right to terminate the agreement if profitability of the
portfolio falls below certain minimum levels. Polaris
financial exposure under this agreement is limited to its

Polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal
course of business. Polaris is currently self insured for all
product liability claims. The estimated costs resulting from any
losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a
loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably
determinable. The Company utilizes historical trends and
actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the
appropriate loss reserve levels. At December31, 2002 the
Company had an accrual of $5,983,000 for the possible payment of
pending claims. This accrual is included as a component of other
accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 34 Table of Contents POLARIS INDUSTRIES INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Litigation: Polaris
is a defendant in lawsuits and subject to claims arising in the
normal course of business. In the opinion of management, it is
unlikely that any legal proceedings pending against or involving
Polaris will have a material adverse effect on Polaris
financial position or results of operations. Leases: Polaris
leases buildings and equipment under non-cancelable operating
leases. Total rent expense under all lease agreements was
$3,118,000, $2,834,000, and $2,981,000, for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Future minimum payments, exclusive of other costs
required under non-cancelable operating leases at
December31, 2002 total $3,823,000 cumulatively through
2005. Note9:Segment Reporting Polaris has reviewed SFASNo131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
