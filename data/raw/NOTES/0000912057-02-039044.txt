INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT   
To
the Board of Directors of
KMG Chemicals,Inc.: 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of KMG Chemicals,Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of July31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of KMG Chemicals,Inc. and subsidiaries as of
July31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the three years in the period ended July31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. s/

KMG CHEMICALS,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
GeneralKMG Chemicals,Inc. the Company is principally involved in the sale and manufacture
of specialty chemicals in niche markets. At the present time, the company sells three wood preserving chemicalspentachlorophenol penta, creosote and sodium pentacholorphenate sodium
penta, and an herbicide product consisting of monosodium and disodium methanearsonic acids MSMA. Penta-manufacturing operations are conducted through KMG de Mexico KMEX, a Mexican
corporation and 9998% owned subsidiary, at a plant in Matamoros, Mexico. The Company has two main suppliers of creosote, which it sells throughout the United States. 
The
Company MSMA agricultural chemicals product line was acquired form Zeneca Ag Products,Inc. Zeneca in October2000. The MSMA production facility acquired from
Zeneca was relocated adjacent to the Company penta manufacturing facility and reassembled. The Company MSMA herbicides are sold under the name Bueno 6 in the United States to protect
cotton crops, primarily in the southern cotton-growing states and in California, and under the name Ansar 66 to state agencies to control highway weed growth. 
The
Company significant accounting policies are as follows: 
Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KMG Chemicals,
KMG-Bernuth, and KMEX. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all investments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents. 
Investments in Marketable SecuritiesThe Company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as
available-for-sale in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss. Fair value of the
equity securities is based upon the quoted market price on the last business day of the fiscal year plus. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. In 2002
the Company sold a portion of its equity securities and realized a gain of approximately $283,000 which was recorded in other income. 
InventoriesInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in
first-out FIFO method. 
Property, Plant, and EquipmentProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 
Income TaxesDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability method in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established 
19  for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. 
Revenue RecognitionThe Company essentially has only one type of revenue transaction in which the Company chemical products
sold in the open market are recognized as revenue as risk and title to the products transfer to the customers, which is usually at the time a shipment is made. Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per common share amounts are calculated using the average number of common shares
outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share assume the exercise of
all stock options having exercise prices less than the average market price of the common stock using the treasury stock method. 
Currency TranslationThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the Company foreign operations. For those operations,
remeasurements to U.S. dollars from currency translations are included in the statement of income. Stock-Based CompensationThe Company has adopted SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under SFAS
No123, the Company is permitted to either record expenses for stock options and other employee compensation plans based on their fair value at the date of grant or to continue to apply its current
accounting policy under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25 APB No25 and recognize compensation expense, if any, based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument at the
measurement date. The Company elected to continue following APB No25 for stock options granted to employees; however, the Company accounts for stock options granted to
non-employees under the provisions of SFAS123. 
Intangible AssetsFor financial statement purposes, identifiable intangible assets are being amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets see Note6. 
Change in EstimatesIn fiscal year 2002, management changed its estimates with respect to certain accrued liabilities that had
been established in prior years. The effect of the changes in estimates was a reduction of accrued liabilities and cost of goods sold by approximately $333,000. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The notes receivable, including the current portion, are of a related-party
nature, and it is not practicable to estimate their fair value. The fair value of the Company debt at July31, 2002 and 2001 was estimated to be the same as its carrying value since the debt
obligations bear interest at a rate consistent with current market rates. 
Concentrations of Credit RisksFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Although the amount of credit exposure to any one institution may exceed federally insured amounts, the Company
limits its cash investments to high-quality financial institutions in order to minimize its credit risk. With respect to accounts receivable, such receivables are primarily from
wood-treating manufacturers located worldwide and agriculture chemicals distributors in the United States. The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer financial
condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is dependent on each customer financial condition. Approximately 52% of the Company gross trade receivables
balance was represented by 5 customers at July31, 2002, which exposes the Company to a concentration of credit risk. 
20  New Accounting StandardsEffective August1, 2002, the Company adopted a statement promulgated by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No142 addresses financial accounting and
reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that the balance sheet valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets be evaluated for impairment at least annually and
requires that the regular charge, or amortization, of goodwill assets against income be discontinued. The Company currently does not have goodwill assets on its balance sheet and will perform an
impairment analysis on its other intangible assets in fiscal 2003 using SFAS142, but based on a preliminary review management does not believe that an impairment charge will be required.
However, the Company has separately identified certain intangible assets that will not be amortizable under SFAS142. Therefore, management expects the adoption of SFAS142 could result
in a reduced amortization expense for the Company. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The new rules supersede SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The new rules retain many of the fundamental recognition and measurement
provisions, but significantly change the criteria for classifying an asset as held-for-sale. SFAS No144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2001, and early adoption is permitted. The Company believes adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or
financial position. 
In
April2002, the FASB issued SFAS No145, Rescission of FASB Statements No4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No13, and Technical Corrections.
The Statement updates, clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements. SFAS No145 rescinds SFAS No4, which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to
be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect. As a result, the criteria in Opinion 30 will now be used to classify those gains and losses. SFAS
No64 amended SFAS No4, and is no longer necessary because SFAS No4 has been rescinded. SFAS No44 was issued to establish accounting requirements for the effects of
transition to the provisions of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980. Because the transition has been completed, SFAS No44 is no longer necessary. SFAS No145 amends SFAS No13 to
require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale-leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale-leaseback transactions.
Management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No145 will have a material impact on the Company financial statements. 
In
June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses accounting and reporting for costs
associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and
Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring. SFAS No146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be
recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue No94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan. Under SFAS
No146, fair value is the
objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS No146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December31, 2002, with early application
encouraged. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS No146 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ReclassificationsCertain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to current year presentation. 
21  2.INVENTORIES 
Inventories are summarized as follows at July31: 2002
2001 Chemical raw materials and supplies 549,098 283,976 Finished chemical products 4,642,920 4,592,285 Total 5,192,018 4,876,261 3.PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

October3, 2000, the Company acquired the MSMA herbicides product line see Note6 and its manufacturing facility from Zeneca, for a total acquisition cost of
$23million. The MSMA manufacturing facility, originally located in Houston, Texas, was dismantled and reassembled adjacent to the Company penta manufacturing facility in Matamoros, Mexico.
Included in construction-in-progress at July31, 2001 are costs of approximately $33million related to the purchase and relocation of the MSMA manufacturing
facility, which costs have been reclassified to building, plant, and equipment in the current year. Depreciation
is principally computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Depreciation expense was $648,503, $336,060 and $333,712 in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The estimated useful lives of classes of assets are as follows: Asset Description 
Life Years Building
15 to 30 Plant
10 to 18 Equipment
3 to 10 Leasehold improvements
5 to 8 4.FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT 
Monetary assets and liabilities and income items for KMEX are remeasured to U.S. dollars at current rates, and certain assets notably plant and production
equipment are remeasured at historical rates. Expense items for KMEX are remeasured at average monthly rates of exchange except for 
22  depreciation and amortization expense. All gains and losses from currency remeasurement for KMEX are included in operations. Foreign currency remeasurement resulted in an aggregate exchange loss of
$2,971 in 2002 and an aggregate exchange gain of $11,705 in 2001 and $15,416 in 1999.

into the supply contract and for the intangible assets, respectively. The supply contract is being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10-year term, which is the initial
term of the contract. The intangible assets, including Allied creosote customer list, one customer contract, certain rail car leases, and Allied rights in creosote product registrations, are being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year term which approximates the life of the assets purchased. 
During
1991, the Company entered into a technology-licensing agreement resulting in the granting to the Company of an exclusive worldwide right and license to use and sublease certain
proprietary and sales information and to manufacture and sell certain products for an indefinite period of time. Total cost to the Company for this license was $320,000, which is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over a 15-year term which approximates the patent life of the products represented by this agreement. On
October3, 2000, the Company acquired various intangible assets, such as brand names and customer lists, in connection with the purchase of the MSMA herbicides product line
from Zeneca Limited see Note3. Approximately $115million of the total $23million acquisition cost was allocated to the
intangible assets purchased. These costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 15-year term, which approximates the life of the assets purchased. 
7.LONG-TERM DEBT 
Effective August1, 1996, the Company entered into a revolving note agreement with a bank that provides for borrowings of up to $3,500,000. The borrowing
base under this agreement is limited by a formula defined in the agreement based on the amount of receivables and inventory. Interest payments will be due monthly. The revolving note is subject to a
one-fourth percent unused line fee and is secured by the Company receivables, inventory, and general intangibles. The loan agreement includes, among other things, restrictions on equity
investments and loans made by the Company and requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and minimum net worth requirements. The 
24  Company was in compliance with debt covenants as of July31, 2002 and 2001. Borrowings outstanding under this agreement at July31, 2002 or 2001 were $1,202,000 and $0, respectively.
The termination date of this loan agreement is January31, 2005. 
On
June26, 1998, the Company entered into a term loan with an original maturity date of July1, 2005 for $6,000,000 with a bank. Starting August1, 1998, the
Company began making monthly principal and interest payments of $91,498. This term loan is secured by the Company receivables, inventory, and general intangibles. The interest rate of the term loan
is variable at LIBOR plus 175% adjusted annually. At July31, 2001, the Company was in compliance with its various debt covenants which, among other things, has restrictions on equity
investments and loans made by the Company and requires the maintenance of a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio and minimum and ratio requirements on tangible net worth. 
The
Company debt at July31, 2002 matures as follows: YearEndingJuly31, 2003 1,059,529 2004 514,003 2005 1,202,000 Total 2,775,532 8.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Operating LeasesThe Company has noncancelable operating leases for its office and warehouse
facilities and certain transportation equipment. At July31, 2002, the Company was obligated under these leases for the following future minimum lease commitments: 2003 325,722 2004 242,884 2005 65,244 2006 10,874 Total 644,724 Rent
expense relating to the operating leases was $355,316, $437,103 and, $346,138 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
EnvironmentalAs a manufacturer and supplier of wood treatment products and herbicides, the Company is subject to a variety of
health, safety, and environmental laws within the countries in which it operates. These governments may implement new laws or regulations that amend or impose restrictions on the sale or use of the
Company raw materials and products. In management opinion, the Company is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and no actions or proceedings against the Company are
known to be in process. 
Producers
of chemicals such as penta, creosote and MSMA are required by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to obtain a registration for their products under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act FIFRA in order to sell those products in the United States. The registration system requires an ongoing submission to the EPA of substantial scientific
research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of pesticides produced by manufacturers. Under an agreement with other industry participants, the Company shares the costs of the
research and testing 
25  required by FIFRA, as well as possible compliance testing required by foreign governments, based on relative market share. 
The
Company incurred expenses in connection with the FIFRA research and testing programs of approximately $520,000, $716,000 and $756,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. These
costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
Future
costs to the Company of the research and testing programs are difficult to quantify, since governments have the authority to amend testing protocols and/or mandate additional
tests. However, management estimates that these costs will be approximately $414,000 in fiscal 2003 and intends to expense these costs as incurred. 
LawsuitsThe Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits in the normal course of business. Management does not believe
that the outcome of any of these matters will have a materially adverse effect on the Company consolidated financial position or results of operations. 9.RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
During 1991, the Company entered into split-dollar insurance arrangements with two officers/stockholders. Under these arrangements, the Company advances funds
for insurance premiums and records these advances as a noncurrent asset. The Company has a security interest in the insurance policies to the extent of the advances made. The security interest is to
be satisfied either from death benefit proceeds or, in the event of termination of the arrangements, by reimbursement from the officers/stockholders. During fiscal 1998, the arrangement with one
such officer was terminated under the provisions of a five-year employment agreement and converted to a noninterest-bearing promissory note. As a portion of the officer compensation
under the employment agreement, the note
is being amortized to compensation expense by the Company over a five-year period beginning January1, 2000 see Note6; such amortization was $74,023, $74,023 and $71,288
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
On
October18, 2000, the Company completed its purchase of 180,000 shares of the Company outstanding common stock from an officer at a price of $500 per share, the value of the
Company common stock on August29, 2000, the date on which the Company Board of Directors approved the transaction. In accordance with the Company desire to remove certain related party
transactions from its accounts, the proceeds from the sale were used by the officer to purchase the Company interest in two promissory notes and to repay loans made to the officer by the Company in
fiscal 1998 and 1994. 
10.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
The Company has a defined contribution 401k plan covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. The participants may contribute from 3% to 15% of their
compensation, and the Company makes matching contributions under this plan equal to 3% of the participant compensation. Company contributions to the plan totaled approximately $31,000, $30,000 and
$40,000 in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
In
July2001, the Company adopted a supplemental executive retirement plan. Only persons specifically designated by the company may be participants in the plan. The plan is
unfunded and amounts payable to participants are general obligations of the company. The plan provides that a participant will be paid a supplemental retirement benefit for 10years equal to a
percentage of the participant three-year average base salary at normal retirement. The benefit payable to participants is reduced by the equivalent actuarial value of the Company other
pension plan payments to the 
26  participant, if any, the Company 401k plan and one-half social security benefits. Normal retirement is the earlier of age 65 and completion of 10years credited service or age
60 with 30years credited service. As of July31, 2001, none of the Company executives were designated as a participant in the plan. One executive was designated as a participant in
August2001, which resulted in $47,164 of expense in 2002. 
11.SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS  The Company had one significant customer in 2002, 2001 and 2000 whose sales as a percentage of total sales were 19%, 15% and 12%, respectively. 
12.STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan the Stock Plan on October15, 1996 and reserved 700,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under
the Stock Plan. The Stock Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, as defined in Section422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and nonqualified stock options.
The Stock Plan will be administered either by the Company Board of Directors or by a committee of two or more nonemployee directors. Subject to the terms of the Stock Plan, the Board of Directors or
the committee has the authority to grant options under the Stock Plan, to amend, construe, and interpret it, and to make all other determinations and take any and all actions necessary or advisable
for its administration. The directors, consultants, and key employees of the Company or any subsidiary are eligible to receive nonqualified options under the Plan but only salaried employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries are eligible to receive incentive stock options. 
Options
will be exercisable during the period specified in each option agreement and in accordance with a vesting schedule to be designated by the Board of Directors or the committee.
Any option agreement may provide that options become immediately exercisable in the event of a change or threatened change in control of the Company and in the event of certain mergers and
reorganizations of the Company. Options may be subject to early termination within a designated period following the option holder cessation of service with the Company. 
27  In 2000 the Company granted an option to acquire 40,000 shares of common stock in consideration for investor relations consulting services. These options would have vested if before
January1, 2000 the average closing price of the Company common stock equaled or exceeded $900 per share for ten consecutive days; however, the options failed to vest and expired
unexercised. Also in 2000 the Company granted warrants to acquire 25,000 shares of common stock to JP Turner Company L.L.P. for consulting services as requested by the Company and pertaining
to the evaluation of acquisition and financing transactions and to investor relations. The warrants are immediately exercisable at a price of $500 per share of common stock through March17,
