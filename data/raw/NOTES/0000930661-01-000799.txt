30             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
MetaSolv, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MetaSolv,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the related financial statement schedule. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MetaSolv,
Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998
1 Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
MetaSolv, Inc. the Company, a Delaware corporation headquartered in
Plano, Texas, develops, delivers and supports software designed to make it
easier for communications service providers to take, manage and fulfill orders
for service from their customers. These communications service providers offer
a full array of communications services including local and long distance
telephone services, high-speed data services and Internet services, often as a
bundled offering. The Company derives substantially all if its revenue from
the sale of licenses, related professional services and maintenance and
support of its MetaSolv SolutionTM packaged software products to these
competitive communications service providers.
a Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statement of
MetaSolv, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
b Revenue Recognition
The Company software products are licensed to customers primarily through
the Company direct sales force. The Company software licensing
arrangements typically include multiple elements, such as software products,
post-contract customer support, consulting, and training. On January 1, 2000,
the Company adopted the residual method of revenue recognition for these
arrangements. The adoption of this method of revenue recognition did not have
a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operation.
Under the residual method, the aggregate arrangement fee is allocated to each
of the undelivered elements in an amount equal to their fair value, with the
residual of the arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements. Fair
values are based upon vendor specific objective evidence. Fees allocated to
each software element of the arrangement are recognized as revenue when the
following criteria have been met: a a written contract for the license of
software has been executed, b the Company has delivered the product to the
customer, c the license fee is fixed or determinable, and d collectibility
of the resulting receivable is deemed probable. If evidence of fair value of
the undelivered elements of the arrangement does not exist, all revenue from
the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does
exist, or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. Fees allocated
to post-contract customer support are recognized as revenue ratably over the
support period. Fees allocated to other services are recognized as revenue as
the service is performed.
The Company is frequently engaged to provide consulting and implementation
services in connection with the licensing of its software. In situations where
such services include significant modification or customization of the
software or are otherwise essential to the functionality of the software,
revenues relating to the software license and services are aggregated and the
combined revenues are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.
Revenue earned using the percentage-of-completion method is based on
management estimate of progress towards completion. Changes to estimates of
progress towards completion, if any, are accounted for as a change in estimate
in the period of the change. Of total deferred revenues, $2,800,695 and
$703,416 as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, represent billings in
excess of costs and related profits on certain contracts accounted for under
the percentage-of-completion method. Of total unbilled receivables, $1,203,526
as of December 31, 2000, represent costs and related profits in excess of
billings on contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method.
36                 METASOLV, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  Accounts receivable include only those amounts due from customers for which
revenue has been recognized. Deferred revenue includes amounts received from
customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Accounts receivable at
December 31, 1999, includes $408,854, which has not been paid in accordance
with the retainage provisions of a long-term contract with a customer.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of investments in an interest-bearing money market
account and commercial paper with maturities of three months or less. For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly
liquid investments with remaining maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
d Marketable Securities
Marketable securities at December 31, 2000, consist of commercial paper of
$194 million, with remaining contractual maturities of 60 days or less, and
debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies of $294 million, with
remaining contractual maturities of 15 months or less. Marketable securities
are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value. Unrealized
holding gains and losses are immaterial.
e Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for
leasehold improvements, the term of the lease, if shorter. The estimated
useful lives are as follows                                     Years
Furniture and   7
Computer   3
Other  3-7 f Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short
maturities.
g Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs incurred prior to the establishment of
technological feasibility of the product are expensed as incurred. After
technological feasibility is established, any additional software development
costs are capitalized. The Company believes its process for developing
software was essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of
technological feasibility and, accordingly, no software development costs have
been capitalized to date.
h Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable.
37                 METASOLV, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the
carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairments to
be recognized are measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the
assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to
sell.
i Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the amounts of existing
assets and liabilities recorded for financial reporting purposes and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is reflected in income tax expense in the
period that includes the enactment date.
j Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
k Stock Option Plan
The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting
prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for
its fixed plan stock options. As such, compensation expense is recorded only
if the fair value of the underlying stock exceeded its exercise price on the
date of grant.
l Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period except
those resulting from investments by and distributions to owners. Net income
loss as reported in the consolidated statements of operations is the
Company only component of comprehensive income during all periods presented.
m Earnings Loss Per Share of Common Stock
Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income or loss
available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings loss per share
reflects the incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the
exercise of all stock options and conversion of all preferred stock that would
have had a dilutive effect on earnings per share.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. Based upon the level of historical
taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods
which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more
likely than not the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible
differences.

5 Convertible Preferred Stock and Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock
In 1996, the Company issued 6,458,480 shares of Class B redeemable
convertible preferred stock for net cash proceeds of $2,475,400. In 1997, the
Company issued 279,680 additional shares of Class B redeemable convertible
preferred stock for cash proceeds of $110,400. In 1998, the Company issued
2,857,146 shares of Class C redeemable convertible preferred stock for cash
proceeds of $10,000,011. In November 1999, effective with the company
initial public offering, each share of outstanding convertible preferred stock
and redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to one share of
common stock. These share amounts have been adjusted for stock splits in June
1998 and October 1999.
6 Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 1992, the Company adopted a stock option plan pursuant to which the
Board of Directors may grant stock options to officers and employees. In
August 1999, the Company adopted the MetaSolv Software, Inc. Long-Term
Incentive Plan which was subsequently merged with the existing stock option
plan. The plan at its adoption authorized grants of options to purchase up to
9,320,000 shares of common stock.
40                 METASOLV, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued  At December 31, 2000, there were 2,644,382 additional shares available for
grant under the plan. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock
options granted for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 was
$2113, $99 and $415, respectively, as estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected dividend yield
of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 6%, an expected life of five years, and
volatility of 80% for 2000 and 0% for 1999 and 1998 prior to the Company
initial public offering.
The number of shares issuable under the plan increases by 5% of the
Company outstanding common stock as of January 1 of each of the first five
calendar years following the plan merger. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2001,
the number of shares authorized under the plan increased to 12,840,534.
Generally, stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the
stock fair market value at the date of grant. All options have terms of ten
years or less, and most options vest in four or five equal cumulative
installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.
The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for stock options
granted to employees and non-employee directors under its stock option plans.
The Company recorded $656,400 of deferred compensation during 1999 as a result
of granting stock options with exercise prices below the estimated fair value
per share of the Company common stock at the date of grant. Deferred
compensation has been recorded as a component of stockholders' equity and is
being amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the
applicable options. Amortization of deferred compensation of $256,000 was
recognized in 2000 and $100,000 was recognized in 1999.
Had the Company determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the
grant date for its stock options and activity under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, the
Company net income loss would have been changed to the pro forma amounts
indicated below in thousands                              Year ended December

Pro  $ 027 $ 007 $002  Pro forma net income loss reflects only stock options granted after
December 31, 1995. Therefore, the full impact of calculating compensation cost
for stock options under SFAS No. 123 is not reflected in the pro forma amounts
presented above because compensation cost is reflected over the options'
vesting periods of five years and compensation expense pertaining to stock
options granted in prior periods is not considered.

Stock Purchase Plan. The plan is authorized to issue 600,000 shares of common
stock, and shares issuable under the plan will increase annually during the
first five years following adoption of the plan by 1% of the Company
outstanding common stock. Accordingly, as of January 1, 2001, the number of
shares authorized under the plan increased to 1,304,107. The plan allows
employees to purchase common stock at a 15% discount from the lower of the
fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of the enrollment
period or the purchase date. During 2000, there were 213,349 shares of common
stock issued under the plan.

10 Segment Information and Concentration of Credit Risk
SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information, establishes standards for the way that public business
enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and requires those enterprises to report selected information about
operating segments in interim financial reports issued to stockholders. The
method for determining what information to report is based on the way
management organizes the operating segments within the Company for making
operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
The Company chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Chief
Executive Officer CEO. The CEO reviews financial information presented on
a company-wide basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues
by product and service line for purposes of making operating decisions and
assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the CEO
is identical to the information presented in the accompanying statements of
operations. Therefore, the Company operates in a single operating segment:
communications software and related services.
