of Contents REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS,Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MAXIMUS,Inc.
as of September30, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended September30, 2008. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
MAXIMUS,Inc. at September30, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September30, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, MAXIMUS,Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2008, based
on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated December10, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst Young LLP McLean, Virginia

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For the years ended September30, 2006,
2007 and 2008 1.
Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies aDescription of Business MAXIMUS,Inc. the Company or we
provides consulting and operations program management primarily to government.
The Company conducts its operations through two business segments: Consulting
and Operations. The Consulting Segment provides specialized financial
consulting services such as assisting states, local agencies, and schools in
obtaining federal funding reimbursements for their programs, and implementing
cost reductions strategies, as well as providing technical services and
software products. The Operations Segment provides a variety of program
management services, primarily the delivery of administrative services for
government health and human service programs. Other than disclosed in Note 2, the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements reflect operating results from continuing
operations. The Company operates predominantly in the
United States. Revenue from foreign-based projects and offices was 13%, 14 and 16% of total revenue for the years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. bPrinciples of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of MAXIMUS,Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. In
addition to the Companys wholly owned subsidiaries, the financial statements
as of and for the fiscal years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008
include a majority 55% owned international subsidiary. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. cRevenue Recognition In fiscal 2008, approximately 74% of our total
revenue was derived from state and local government agencies; 7% from federal
government agencies; 16% from foreign customers; and 3% from other sources,
such as commercial
customers. Revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing
arrangements, including: 1fixed-price; 2performance-based
criteria; 3costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost-plus; and 4time
and materials. Also, some contracts contain not-to-exceed provisions. Of the
contracts with not-to-exceed provisions, to the extent we estimate we will
exceed the contractual limits, we treat these contracts as fixed price. For
fiscal 2008, revenue from fixed-price contracts was approximately 33% of total
revenue; revenue from performance-based contracts was approximately 36% of
total revenue; revenue from cost-plus contracts was approximately 28% of total
revenue; and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately 3% of
total revenue. A majority of the contracts with state and local government
agencies have been fixed-price and performance-based, and our contracts with
the federal government generally have been cost-plus. Fixed-price and
performance-based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve
more risk than cost-plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts. We
recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and
amounts are earned in accordance with the Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101,
Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, as amended by SABNo104,
Revenue Recognition SAB104. We consider amounts to be earned once
evidence of an arrangement has been obtained, services are delivered, fees are
fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. We
recognize revenue on fixed-priced contracts when earned, as services are
provided. For certain fixed-price contracts, primarily systems design,
development and implementation, we recognize revenue based on costs incurred
using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred in
accordance with the provisions of AICPA Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain
Production-Type Contracts SOP 81-1. The cumulative impact of any
revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which
the facts that give rise to the revision become known. 37 Table of Contents For
other fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis
unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in
a different pattern. With fixed-price contracts, we are subject to the risk of
potential cost overruns. For fixed-price contracts accounted for under SOP
81-1, provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided in
full in the period in which such losses become known. Costs related to contracts
may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue. These costs are
generally expensed. However, certain direct and incremental set-up costs may be
deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized, when
such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement. Set-up costs are
costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a
client. The timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit
margins. We
recognize revenue on performance-based contracts as such revenue becomes fixed
or determinable, which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers.
For certain contracts, this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular
increments. Revenue
on cost-plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate
of the negotiated fee earned. Revenue on time and materials contracts is
recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred. Our
most significant expense is cost of revenue, which consists primarily of project-related
costs such as employee salaries and benefits, subcontractors, computer
equipment and travel expenses. Our management uses its judgment and experience
to estimate cost of revenue expected on projects. Our managements ability to
accurately predict personnel requirements, salaries and other costs as well as
to effectively manage a project or achieve certain levels of performance can
have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our fixed-price,
performance-based and time and materials contracts. If actual costs are higher
than our managements estimates, profitability may be adversely affected.
Service cost variability has little impact on cost-plus arrangements because
allowable costs are reimbursed by the customer. We also license software under license agreements. Software revenue is
recognized in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2, as amended by Statement of Position 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, With Respect to Certain Transactions
SOP 98-9. Software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters
into a non-cancelable license agreement, the software product has been
delivered, there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance, there are
no significant future performance obligations, the license fees are fixed or
determinable and collection of the license fee is considered probable. Amounts
received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred and classified as
deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As required
by SOP 98-9, the Company determines the value of the software component of its
multiple-element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific
objective evidence VSOE of fair value exists for the undelivered elements
such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and
training services, but not for all delivered elements such as the software
itself. The residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered
elements based on the fair value of such elements, as indicated by VSOE. VSOE
is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately. Maintenance
and post-contract customer support revenue are recognized ratably over the term
of the related agreements, which in most cases is one year. Revenue from
software-related consulting services under time and material contracts and for
training is recognized as services are performed. Revenue from other
software-related contract services requiring significant modification or
customization of software is recognized under the percentage-of-completion
method. Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No00-21 EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, requires
contracts with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of
accounting if certain criteria are met. We apply the guidance therein and
recognize revenue on multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting if
the criteria are met. dCash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to
be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are valued at cost, which approximates
market. 38 Table of Contents eMarketable Securities Marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of taxes, reported as a separate component of shareholders
equity. Realized gains losses and declines in market value judged to be other
than temporary, of which there were $237,000 in 2006 and none in 2007 and 2008,
are included in other income. Interest and dividends are also included in other
income. Marketable securities consist primarily of short-term auction rate
bonds. At September30, 2006, 2007, and 2008, accumulated unrealized gains
losses on marketable securities, net of tax, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, were none. fRestricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts collected
on behalf of certain customers and its use is restricted to the purposes
specified under our contracts with these customers. gAccounts Receivable and Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at their
face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful
accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of
collecting less than full payment on our receivables. On a regular basis
we re-evaluate our client receivables, especially receivables that are past
due, and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client
collection issues. hProperty and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost and
depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives not
to exceed 395years for the Companys buildings and between three and
seven years for office furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over their useful life or the remaining term of the lease, whichever
is shorter. iSoftware Development Costs Software development costs are capitalized in
accordance with FAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed and are
reported in discontinued operations. The Company capitalizes both purchased
software that is ready for resale and costs incurred internally for software
development projects from the time technological feasibility is established.
Capitalized software development costs are reported at the lower of unamortized
cost or estimated net realizable value. Upon the general release of the
software to customers, capitalized software development costs for the products
are amortized over the greater of the ratio of gross revenues to expected total
revenues of the product or on the straight-line method of amortization over the
estimated economic life of the product, which ranges from three to five years. The Company also capitalizes software
development costs in accordance with AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use SOP 98-1 which are reported in continuing
operations. Direct costs of time and material incurred for the
development of application software for internal use are capitalized and
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the
software, ranging from three to seven years. jDeferred Contract Costs Deferred contract costs consist of
contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service
contracts in progress. These costs include direct and incremental costs
incurred prior to the commencement of us providing service to enable us to
provide the contracted services to our customer. Such costs are expensed over
the period services are provided under the long-term service contract. We review deferred contract costs for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. Our review is based on our projection of the
undiscounted future operating cash flows of the related customer project. To
the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are
not sufficient to recover the carrying amount, we recognize a non-cash
impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal projected future
discounted cash flows. 39 Table of Contents kGoodwill and Intangible Assets The Company applies Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No141, Business Combinations FAS
141, and No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets FAS 142. Under these rules, goodwill is not
amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with FAS 142.
Annually, the Company performs a fair value analysis of its reporting units
using valuation techniques prescribed in FAS 142 as of July1st
of each year. Based on the analysis performed as of July1,2008, the
Company determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill. Subsequent to
the analysis performed as of July1, 2008, the Company recorded a $76
million goodwill impairment charge related to the ERP division which was
retained by the Company following the divestiture of three Systems businesses
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. See Note 7. Goodwill and Intangible
Assets below for more information. Intangible assets from acquisitions, which
consist primarily of customer contracts and relationships, technology-based
intangibles and non-competition agreements, are amortized over five to ten
years, based on their estimated useful lives. lLong-Lived Assets excluding
Goodwill The Company follows the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards No144, Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets FAS 144. FAS
144 requires long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the long-term
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the long-lived
assets being evaluated and a determination is made that the fair value of the
asset is less than its book value. Any write-downs are treated as permanent
reductions in the carrying amount of the assets. The Company believes that the
carrying values of its assets as of September30, 2008 are fully
realizable. mIncome Taxes Deferred tax liabilities and assets are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax
basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect
during the year in which the differences reverse. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax
expense in the period that includes the enactment date. A tax benefit or
expense is recognized for the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability
during the year and the current tax liability for the year. As of September30,
2008, the Company had $05 million of deferred tax assets related to net
operating loss carryforwards in a subsidiary in Canada. We believe we will
generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss
carryforwards within the expiration period based on an existing contract within
this Canadian operation. To the extent that future taxable income from this
contract is revised and it is determined that there will be insufficient
taxable income generated to utilize all available net operating loss
carryforwards, a valuation allowance will be recorded in the provision for
income taxes in the period the determination is made, and the deferred tax
assets will be reduced by this amount. As of September30, 2008, the
Company had $53 million of net operating loss carryforwards related to another
subsidiary in Canada. A full valuation allowance of $18 million has been
established against the related deferred tax asset. Evaluating the net operating loss
carryforwards requires us to make certain estimates, which we believe are
reasonable. Effective October1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
FIN 48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax
positions. FIN48 provides that the financial statement effects of an
income tax position can only be recognized when, based on the technical merits,
it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon
examination. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the Company recognized an
increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $03 million, which
was accounted for as a decrease in the October1, 2007 balance of retained
earnings on our consolidated balance sheet. nComprehensive Income Loss Comprehensive income loss includes changes
in the balances of the items that are reported directly as separate components
of shareholders equity. Comprehensive income loss includes net income plus
changes in the net unrealized gain loss on investments, net of taxes, and
changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. 40 Table of Contents oForeign Currency The assets and liabilities of foreign
operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates and
revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
The resulting cumulative translation adjustment is included in accumulated
other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet. For the
years ended September30, 2006, 2007, and 2008, accumulated foreign
currency gains losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income
loss were $394,000, $2,646,000 and $3,806,000, respectively. Included
within accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal 2008 is a credit of
$56 million representing the cumulative effect of translating goodwill and
intangible assets related to certain 2002 acquisitions to current foreign
exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains losses, including foreign
currency gains losses on short-term loans with our foreign subsidiaries, are
included in other income and were $741,000, $194,000 and $157,000 for the
years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. pEarnings per Share FAS 128, Earnings per Share, requires dual
presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Basic earnings per share exclude
dilution and are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Diluted earnings
per share include the incremental effect of stock options and restricted stock
units calculated using the treasury stock method. qFair Value of Financial Instruments The Company considers the recorded value of
its financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable,
to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at September30,
2007 and 2008. rStock-Based Compensation Effective October1, 2005, the Company
adopted the provisions of SFAS No123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the  method. sUse of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates used by the
Company include estimates of profits or loss on contracts in process, estimates
of collectibility of receivables, evaluation of asset impairment and accrual of
estimated liabilities. tLegal and Settlement Expense Legal and settlement expense consists of costs, net of reimbursed
insurance claims, related to significant legal settlements and non-routine
legal matters, including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred
in connection with those matters. Legal expenses incurred in the ordinary
course of business are included in selling, general and administrative expense. uReclassifications Certain financial results
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Such
reclassifications include the qualification of our Security Solutions division,
Unison MAXIMUS,Inc. and Justice Solutions, Education Systems and Asset
Solutions divisions as discontinued operations under FASB Statement No144.
We reclassified our consolidated balance sheet as of September30, 2007 to
show the assets and liabilities of theses qualifying divisions as discontinued
operations. We also reclassified our consolidated statements of operations and
statements of cash flows for the years ended September30, 2007 and 2006
to show the results of those qualifying divisions as discontinued operations. 41 Table
of Contents vContingencies From
time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, including contract and
employment claims, in the ordinary course of business. We assess the likelihood
of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as
potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly. The
amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new
developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change
in settlement strategy. 2. Discontinued Operations On
April30, 2008, the Company sold its Security Solutions division for cash
proceeds of $46 million, net of transaction costs of $04 million, and
recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $29 million. The financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows of this business are reported as
discontinued operations and all prior periods have been reclassified to conform
to the current periods presentation. The Security Solutions division was previously
reported as part of the Companys Systems Segment. On
May2, 2008, the Company sold its Unison MAXIMUS,Inc. subsidiary for
proceeds of $65 million. The sale transaction is structured as a sale of stock
to the current management team of the subsidiary. The sale price of $65
million consists of $01 million in cash and $64 million in the form of a
promissory note secured by 1a security interest in all of the assets of
the former subsidiary; 2a pledge of shares by the buyer; and 3a
personal guaranty by members of the current management team who are
shareholders of the buyer. In accordance with Topic 5-U of SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No81, Gain Recognition on the Sale of a Business or Operating
Assets to a Highly Leveraged Entity, the Company has deferred recognition of a
pre-tax gain on the sale of $39 million, and interest income on the promissory
note, until realization is more fully assured. The deferred gain of $39
million is reflected as a deduction from the note receivable on the
consolidated balance sheet as of September30, 2008. The financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows of this business are reported
as discontinued operations and all prior periods have been reclassified to
conform to the current periods presentation. Unison MAXIMUS,Inc. was
previously reported as part of the Companys Consulting Segment. On
September30, 2008, the Company sold its Justice Solutions, Education
Systems, and Asset Solutions divisions, which were previously reported as part of
its Systems Segment. Total consideration for the transaction was $400 million,
including a $350 million cash payment received at closing and a $50 million
holdback for one year from closing, subject to a purchase price adjustment and
any claims based on representations and warranties. The Company deferred
recognition of the holdback and, net of transaction costs of $20 million,
recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $122 million. Beginning in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company classified the results of operations of
these divisions as discontinued operations and incorporated the Enterprise
Resource Planning ERP Solutions division into the Consulting Segment. The
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these businesses
are reported as discontinued operations and all prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current periods presentation. The

Unbilled accounts receivable and deferred revenue relate primarily to
contracts wherein the timing of billings to customers varies based on
individual contracts and often differs from the period of revenue recognition.
At September30, 2007 and 2008, there was $30 million and $28 million,
respectively, billed but not paid by customers pursuant to contractual
retainage provisions. Such balances are included in billed accounts receivable
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At September30, 2007 and 2008, $25 million and $22 million of
billed long-term contract receivables, net of reserves of $06 million and $06
million, respectively, are included in other assets. In evaluating the net realizable value of accounts receivable, the
Company considers such factors as current economic trends, customer
credit-worthiness, and changes in the customer payment terms and collection
trends. Changes in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account
receivable may result in a reserve being recognized in the period in which the
change occurs. 43 Table of Contents Changes in the reserves against billed

Deferred Contract Costs Deferred contract costs consist of
contractually recoverable direct set-up costs relating to long-term service
contracts in progress. These costs include direct and incremental costs
incurred prior to the commencement of us providing contracted services to our customers
totaling $286 million and $309 million at September30, 2007 and 2008,
respectively, of which $76 million is leased equipment at September30,
2007 and 2008. Deferred contract costs are expensed ratably as services are
provided under the contracts. For the fiscal years ended September30,
2007 and 2008, accumulated amortization of deferred contract costs was $205
million and $256 million, of which $57 million and $72 million,
respectively, is the accumulated amortization of capital lease assets included
in deferred costs. 44 Table of Contents During
the fiscal year ended September30, 2006, the Company determined that the
estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the Texas Integrated
Eligibility project over its remaining term were insufficient to recover the
projects deferred contract costs. As a result, the Company recognized a
non-cash impairment charge of $171 million to write off the full unamortized
balance of the projects deferred contract costs. The write-off is included in
the results of the Operations Segment. Additional information regarding the
Texas Integrated Eligibility project is disclosed in Note 20. Texas Integrated
Eligibility Project. 7.

Credit Facilities In June2003, in connection with a long-term
contract, the Company issued a standby letter of credit in an initial amount of
up to $200 million, which amount was reduced to $100 million on April1,
2005. The letter of credit, which expires on March31, 2009, may be called
by the customer in the event the Company defaults under the terms of the
contract. The Company also has two letters of credit in connection with
insurance policies, which total approximately $04 million. The letters of
credit for insurance policies expire in May2009 and automatically renew
annually, thereafter. On January25, 2008, the Company entered into
a Revolving Credit Agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit
facility, with SunTrust Bank as administrative agent, issuing bank and
swingline lender, and a syndicate of other lenders the Credit Facility. The
Credit Facility provides for a $500 million revolving line of credit
commitment, which may be used ifor revolving loans, iifor
swingline loans, subject to a sublimit of $50 million, and iiito
request the issuance of letters of credit on the Companys behalf, subject to a
sublimit of $250 million.The Company may request an increase in the
commitment under the Credit Facility, such that the aggregate commitments under
the Credit Facility shall at no time exceed $750 million. On June30,
2008, SunTrust Banks commitment automatically stepped down from $500 million
to $350 million in accordance
with the terms of the Credit Facility. The credit available under the Credit
Facility may be used, among other purposes, to refinance the Companys current
indebtedness, to repurchase shares of the Companys capital stock and to
finance the ongoing working capital, capital expenditure, and general corporate
needs of the Company. At September30,
2008, letters of credit totaling $104 million are outstanding under the Credit
Facility. Subject
to applicable conditions, the Company may elect interest rates on its revolving
borrowings calculated by reference to ithe prime lending rate as
announced by SunTrust Bank or, if higher, the federal funds effective rate
plus 050% a Base Rate
Borrowing,
or iithe reserve adjusted rate per annum equal to the offered rate for
deposits in U.S. dollars for a one 1, two 2, three 3or six 6month
period in the London Inter-Bank Market a LIBOR Borrowing, and, in each case, plus an
applicable margin that is determined by reference to the Companys then-current
leverage ratio. For swingline borrowings, the Company will pay interest at the
rate of interest for a one 1month LIBOR Borrowing, plus the applicable
margin, or at a rate to be separately agreed upon by the Company and the
administrative agent. The
Credit Facility matures on January25, 2013, at which time all outstanding
borrowings must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must have been
terminated or cash collateralized. 46 Table
of Contents The
Credit Facility, as amended by the Company and its lender on December12,
2008, provides for the payment of specified fees and expenses, including an
up-front fee and commitment and letter of credit fees, and contains customary
financial and other covenants that require the maintenance of certain ratios
including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants in the amended Credit Facility as of September30, 2008. The
Companys obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of
the Companys direct and indirect subsidiaries collectively, the Guarantors
and are secured by substantially all of MAXIMUS and the Guarantors present
and future tangible and intangible assets, including the capital stock of
subsidiaries and other investment property. At September30, 2007 and 2008, the Company
had performance bond commitments totaling $877 million and $834 million,
respectively. 10.
Leases The Company leases office space under various
operating leases which typically contain clauses permitting cancellation upon
certain conditions, including the early termination, non-renewal or material
alteration of the related customer contract. The terms of these leases
typically provide for certain minimum payments as well as increases in lease
payments based upon the operating cost of the facility and the consumer price
index. Rent expense for the years ended September30, 2006, 2007, and 2008
was $208 million, $210 million, and $195 million, respectively. On July15, 2003, the Company entered into a capital lease
financing arrangement with a financial institution, whereby the Company acquired
assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement. Rental payments for assets
leased are payable over a 60-month period at a rate of 405% commencing in January2004.
On March29, 2004, the Company entered into a supplemental capital lease
financing arrangement with the same financial institution whereby the Company
acquired additional assets pursuant to an equipment lease agreement. Rental
payments for assets leased under the supplemental arrangement are payable over
a 57-month period at a rate of 361% commencing in April2004. At September30,
2008, capital lease obligations of $04 million were outstanding related to
these lease arrangements for equipment. Minimum future payments under leases in
effect as of September30, 2008 are as follows in thousands

Employee Benefit Plans and Deferred Compensation The Company has 401kplans and other
defined contribution plans for the benefit of all employees who meet certain
eligibility requirements. The plans provide for Company match, specified
Company contributions, and/or discretionary Company contributions. During the
years ended September30, 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Company contributed
$34 million, $32 million, and $39 million to the plans, respectively. 47 Table

Income Taxes Effective October1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of
Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No109,
FIN 48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax
positions. FIN48 provides that the financial statement effects of an
income tax position can only be recognized when, based on the technical merits,
it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon
examination. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN48
was required to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings in the period of adoption. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the Company accounted for the change in
reserve for uncertain tax positions as a $03 million decrease to the beginning
balance of retained earnings in our consolidated balance sheet. The Companys
net unrecognized tax benefits totaled $20 million at October1, 2007 and
remains $20 million at September30, 2008.The total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual
effective income tax rate is $20 million at September30, 2008. It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits could decrease by as much as $04million within the next twelve
months as a result of settlement of audit issues, expiration of statute of
limitations and/or payment of uncertain tax liabilities, which could have an
impact on the effective tax rate. The
anticipated reversals are related to state tax items, none of which
individually are significant. FIN
48 requires uncertain tax positions to be recognized and presented on a gross
basis i.e., without regard to likely offsets for deferred tax assets,
deductions, and/or credits that would result from payment of uncertain tax
amounts. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands

On a net basis, the balance
at September30, 2007 is $20 million including related interest amounts
after offsetting deferred tax assets, competent authority benefits, deductions,
and/or credits on the Companys tax returns, and it remains at $20 million at September30,
2008. The Company files income tax
returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and in various state and
foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to US Federal income
tax examinations for years before 2004 and is no longer subject to state and
local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before
2003. The Company has elected to
report interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. In the
fiscal year ending September30, 2008, the Company recognized interest
expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits of less than $01 million. The
net FIN 48 liability balance at September30, 2008 of $20 million
includes approximately $03 million of interest and penalties. 48 Table

of Contents We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on
the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as we consider these to
be permanently reinvested in the operations of such subsidiaries. If some of
these earnings were distributed, some countries may impose withholding taxes;
in addition, as foreign taxes have been previously paid on these earnings, we
would expect to be entitled to a U.S. foreign tax credit that would reduce the
U.S. taxes owed on such distributions. As such, it is not practical to
determine the net amount of the related unrecognized U.S. deferred tax
liability. As of September30, 2008, the Company
had $05 million of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss
carryforwards in a subsidiary in Canada. These net operating loss carryforwards
begin to expire at the end of fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2016. We believe we
will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards
within the expiration period based on an existing contract within this Canadian
operation. To the extent that future taxable income from this contract is
revised and it is determined that there will be insufficient taxable income
generated to utilize all available net operating loss carryforwards, a
valuation allowance will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the
period the determination is made, and the deferred tax assets will be reduced
by this amount. As of September30, 2008, the Company had $53 million of
net operating loss carryforwards related to another subsidiary in Canada. A
full valuation allowance of $18 million has been established against the
related deferred tax asset. These net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire
at the end of fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2017. Cash paid for income taxes during the years
ended September30, 2006, 2007, and 2008 was $220 million, $103 million,
and $238 million, respectively. Approximately 90% of the Companys total
goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 13.
Shareholders Equity Stock-Based Compensation The Companys Board of Directors established stock
option plans during 1997 pursuant to which the Company may grant non-qualified
stock options to officers, employees and directors of the Company. Such plans
also provide for stock awards and direct purchases of the Companys common
stock. At September30, 2008, the Board of Directors had reserved 80
million shares of common stock for issuance under the Companys stock plans. At
September30, 2007, 19 million shares remained available for grants under
the Companys stock plans. Stock options are granted at exercise prices equal
to the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant.
Stock options generally vest ratably over a period of four years, and beginning
in fiscal 2005, expire six years after date of grant. Options issued prior to
fiscal 2005 expire ten years after date of grant. For the fiscal years ended September30,
2007 and 2008, compensation expense related to stock options was $08 million
and $27 million, respectively. The Company also issues Restricted Stock Units
RSUs to officers, employees and directors of the Company under its 1997
Equity Incentive Plan Plan. Generally, these RSUs vest ratably over six
years with full vesting upon the sixth anniversary of the date of grant,
provided, however, that the vesting will accelerate if the Company meets
certain earnings targets determined by the Board of Directors. The fair value
of the RSUs, based on the Companys stock price at the grant date, is expensed
over the vesting period. For the fiscal years ended September30, 2006,
2007 and 2008, compensation expense recognized related to RSUs was $21
million, $31 million and $68 million, respectively. Prior to October1, 2005, the Company
accounted for its stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations, as permitted by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Effective October1,
2005, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No123R, Share-Based
Payment, using the  method. 50 Table of Contents Under the 
method, compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year ended September30,
2006, included icompensation cost for all stock-based payments granted
prior to but not yet vested as of October1, 2005, based on the grant date
fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No123,
and iicompensation cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent
to October1, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123R. Results for prior
periods have not been restated. Stock-based compensation cost is recognized
in selling, general and administrative expense and, under the fair value
provisions of SFAS No123R, was $66 million, $38 million and $95
million for the fiscal years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008,
respectively. During the
first quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company identified an error in prior periods
in recorded stock-based compensation expense related to stock options and RSUs.
The error was due, in part, to how the software used by the Company applied
estimated forfeiture rates to fully vested stock options and RSUs. The impact
was to underestimate stock compensation expense by $11 million in each of
fiscal 2006 and 2007. The Company has corrected this error by recording
additional stock compensation expense of $22 million in the first quarter of
fiscal 2008. The total income tax
benefit recognized in the income statement for share-based compensation
arrangements was $26 million, $21 million and $07 million for the fiscal
years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The
weighted average fair value of stock options was estimated at the date of the
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method with the following
assumptions for the fiscal years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008

52 Table
of Contents As of September30, 2008, the total remaining
unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and RSUs was
$23 million and $116 million, respectively. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No123R, the
Company presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of
stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
SFAS No123Rrequires the cash flows resulting from the tax
benefits generated from tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs
recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as
financing cash flows. 53 Table
of Contents Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company previously offered an employee stock
purchase plan ESPP that allowed eligible employees to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock each quarter at 95% of the market value on the last day
of the quarter. The ESPP was not considered compensatory under the provisions
of SFAS No123Rand therefore no portion of the costs related to
ESPP purchases were included in the Companys stock-based compensation expense.
During
fiscal 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively, the Company issued 36,971, 6,838,
and zero shares of common stock pursuant to this plan at an average price of
$2813, $2924, and zero per share. The ESPP was terminated in fiscal 2007 and
the last purchase under the plan was made in January2007 for the fiscal
quarter ending December31, 2006. Stock Repurchase Program On July23, 2007, the Company announced that it
had retained UBS Investment Bank as a financial advisor to assist the Board of
Directors in exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value,
including a possible sale of the Company. On November14, 2007, the
Company announced that its Board of Directors had completed its process to
explore strategic alternatives and had authorized the repurchase of up to
$1500 million of the Companys outstanding common stock under an Accelerated
Share Repurchase ASR program. After a thorough review process, the Board of
Directors concluded that launching a $1500 million ASR program, concentrating
the Companys strategic focus on core health and human services offerings and
considering alternatives for certain non-core assets, provides the best
opportunity to maximize shareholder value, reflecting the Companys strong
financial position and future growth prospects. In connection with the ASR program, the Company
entered into an ASR agreement with UBS Investment Bank on November15,
2007. Under the ASR agreement, the Company acquired and retired 3,758,457
shares at an initial price of $3991 per share for $1500 million plus fees of
approximately $04 million. UBS purchased an equivalent number of shares in the
open market over the nine-month period ending August15, 2008. Pursuant to
the ASR agreement, at its completion the Companys initial price under the ASR
agreement was adjusted down based on the volume-weighted average price VWAP
of the Companys stock during this period. Such adjustment could be settled in
cash or stock at the Companys discretion. On July11, 2008, UBS
Investment Bank completed the purchase of shares in the open market, and the
Company elected to receive the price adjustment of $139 million in cash. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, this receipt of cash was recorded as a decrease
to treasury stock in the full amount of $139 million. Under a resolution adopted in July2008, the
Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase, at managements discretion,
of up to an aggregate of $750 million of the Companys common stock. The
resolution also authorized the use of option exercise proceeds for the
repurchase of the Companys common stock. At September30, 2008, $820
million remained available for future stock repurchases under the resolution.
As of December12, 2008, the Company has repurchased 648,490 common shares
at a cost of $200 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The company repurchased 282,100 common shares at a
cost of $101 million, zero common shares at a cost of zero and 4,145,057
common shares at a cost of $1645 million in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. 14. Commitments and
Contingencies Litigation The Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including
contract and employment claims, in the ordinary course of its business. The
matters reported on below involve significant pending or potential claims
against us. aIn January2007, MAXIMUS initiated arbitration
against Accenture LLP to resolve various disputes that had arisen under a
subcontract between the parties in support of Accentures prime contract with
the Texas Health and Human Services Commission HHSC for the Integrated
Eligibility and Enrollment Services program the Program. Among other
things, the Company asserted that Accenture had breached the subcontract
resulting in damages to MAXIMUS in excess of $100 million. 54 Table
of Contents Accenture denied MAXIMUS
claims and asserted a counterclaim that MAXIMUS breached the subcontract.
Accenture alleged unspecified damages which it stated could be hundreds of
millions of dollars. The subcontract incorporated the terms and conditions of
the prime contract which contained a limitation of liability of $2500 million. In February2007,
MAXIMUS terminated its subcontract with Accenture. In March2007, HHSC
announced that it was winding down its contract with Accenture. HHSC alleged a
variety of damages arising from the parties operation of the Program.
Accenture indicated that its damages claim against MAXIMUS in the arbitration
proceeding would include damages asserted by HHSC against Accenture. Shortly after the
wind down of the Accenture contract with HHSC, MAXIMUS entered into agreements
directly with HHSC to provide enrollment broker, CHIP operations and
eligibility support services. The contracts for CHIP operations and eligibility
support services run through December31, 2008, and the enrollment broker
contract runs through August31, 2010. In December 2008,
MAXIMUS, Accenture and HHSC settled all claims among the parties, both the
claims in the arbitration proceeding and the contract wind down claims. In
connection with that settlement, MAXIMUS agreed to pay a total of $400 million
and to provide services to HHSC valued at an additional $100 million. The
Companys primary insurance carrier has agreed to pay $125 million of the
amount due from MAXIMUS. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a pre-tax charge
of $375 million in legal and settlement expense in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. The
corresponding accrued liability related to the settlement is included in other
accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2008 in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. The Company continues to pursue additional insurance recoveries
from its excess insurance carriers; however, such recoveries are not assured. bIn
November2007, MAXIMUS was sued by the State of Connecticut in the
Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford. MAXIMUS had entered into a
contract in 2003 with the Connecticut Department of Information Technology to
update the States criminal justice information system. The State claims that
MAXIMUS breached its contract and also alleges negligence and breach of the
implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. MAXIMUS has sued its
primary subcontractor on the effort ATS Corporation which abandoned the
project before completing its obligations. Although the State did not specify
damages in its complaint, it demanded payment of alleged damages of
approximately $62 million in a letter sent to the Company in September2007.
The Company denies that it has breached its contract with the State. The
Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal proceedings or any settlement
negotiations or the impact they may have on the Companys operating results or
financial condition. cIn
2003, MAXIMUS contracted to provide an integrated case management system and
related services for a certain City. The City alleged that the Company failed
to satisfy various contractual requirements, and the Company denied those
allegations. In the interest of avoiding the costs, risks and distraction of litigation,
the parties agreed to a mutual termination of the contract and settlement of
the claims. Under the terms of the settlement, MAXIMUS paid the City $50
million and forgave outstanding accounts receivable of $20 million.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $70 million classified in
discontinued operations during the year ended September30, 2008. Employment Agreements The Company has an employment agreement with
its chief executive officer with a term ending in fiscal 2010. 15.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and Major Customers Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of accounts receivable, billed and unbilled. To date, these financial
instruments have been derived from contract revenue earned primarily from
federal, state and local government agencies located in the United States. For the years ended September30, 2006,
2007, and 2008, the Company derived approximately 17%, 17%, and 15 respectively, of its consolidated revenue from contracts with the state of
California, principally within our Operations Segment. 55 Table
of Contents For the years ended September30, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Company
derived approximately 6%, 9% and 14%, respectively, of its consolidated revenue
from contracts with the state of Texas, principally within our Operations
Segment. 16.

18. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In
September2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No157, Fair Value
Measurements, which is effective in fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007, which is the Companys 2009 fiscal year. SFAS No157 defines fair
value, establishes a market-based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair
value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The new standard
is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits
assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value, with limited exceptions.
We are in the process of reviewing and evaluating SFAS No157, and
therefore the ultimate impact of its adoption is not yet known. In
February2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB
Statement No115, which is effective in fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007, which is the Companys 2009 fiscal year. SFAS No159 permits
entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified
election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the
fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting
date. We are in the process of reviewing and evaluating SFAS No159, and
therefore the ultimate impact of its adoption is not yet known. 58 Table of Contents In
December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised SFAS 141R,
Business Combinations, which is effective for business combinations entered
into in fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008, which is the
Companys 2010 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is prohibited. Under
SFAS 141R, more transactions will be recorded as business combinations, as it
changes the definitions of a business, which would no longer be required to be
self-sustaining or revenue generating, and a business combination, which would
include combinations that occur by contract alone or due to changes in
substantive participation rights, such as a lapse in minority veto rights. Certain
acquired contingencies will be recorded initially at fair value on the
acquisition date. After the acquisition, if new information is available,
contingent liabilities will be measured at the higher of the likely amount to
be paid and the acquisition-date fair value. Contingent assets will be measured
subsequently at the lower of the current estimated future amount to be realized
and the acquisition-date fair value. Transaction and restructuring costs
generally will be expensed as incurred. In partial acquisitions, companies
generally will record 100 percent of the assets and liabilities at fair value,
including goodwill. This will likely result in higher related depreciation and
amortization charges in subsequent periods than under the current standard. SFAS
141Rwill only impact us if we acquire businesses subsequent to the
effective date of the standard. Concurrent
with the issuance of SFAS 141R, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, which is effective for fiscal
years beginning on or after December15, 2008, which is the Companys 2010
fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is prohibited. This statement will
be applied prospectively as of October1, 2009 except for the presentation
and disclosure requirements. The standard changes the accounting and reporting
for minority interests and requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified, labeled, and
presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity,
but separate from the parents equity. It also requires that the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling
interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated
statement of income. We are in the process of reviewing and evaluating SFAS No160,
and therefore the ultimate impact of its adoption is not yet known. 19. Business Combinations In fiscal 2008, the Company acquired the business described below in a
business combination accounted for as a purchase. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired business
since the date of the acquisition. On
August1, 2008, the Company acquired 100% of the shares of Westcountry
Training and Consultancy Service WTCS Limited, a privately-owned employment
and training company in the United Kingdom that specializes in helping people
who are disadvantaged in the labor market gain employment. The purchase price
for the shares is 30 million approximately $60 million U.S. Per the terms
of the share purchase agreement, additional consideration of approximately 05
million approximately $10 million U.S. may be paid based on the achievement
of certain future performance objectives. The total purchase cost, including
transactions costs of $04 million, was $64 million. In conjunction with the purchase, the Company
recorded goodwill of $43 million and intangible assets, primarily customer
contracts and relationships, of $11 million, and other net assets of $10
million which have been assigned to the Operations Segment. The primary reason
for acquiring WTCS was to establish a presence in the United
Kingdom market from which to expand the Companys workforce services business.
The purchase price allocation is not finalized and is subject to the final
working capital adjustments, which are currently not expected to be material.
Unaudited pro forma results of operations are not provided because the historical
operating results were not significant and pro forma results would not be
significantly different from reported results for the periods presented. 20. Texas Integrated Eligibility Project Our
fiscal 2007 results were respectively impacted by a $252 million operating
loss on the Texas Integrated Eligibility project. Up until February2007,
we served as a subcontractor to Accenture as part of the Texas Access Alliance,
which provides services under the Texas Health and Human Services Commissions
TX HHSC Integrated Eligibility Program. We were awarded the five-year, $370
million subcontract in June2005. In June2006, we amended our
subcontract with Accenture to reduce scope and realign responsibilities. In November2006,
we announced that we commenced negotiations with Accenture to further reduce
our scope on the project. In January2007, we initiated arbitration to
resolve certain disputes under the subcontract and in February2007, we
terminated our subcontract with Accenture. In March2007, the TX HHSC
terminated its contract with Accenture and contracted directly with us to
provide support services for its State Childrens Health Insurance Program
SCHIP and to provide enrollment broker services for its Medicaid program. We
continue to provide services under these programs, but on a profitable basis. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies
above for additional information. 59 Table

Controls and Procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule13a-15eunder
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act as of the end of the
period covered by this Annual Report on Form10-K. Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective and
designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the requisite time periods. Managements Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rule13a-15funder the Exchange Act. Our internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of published
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, we believe that as of September30, 2008, our internal control
over financial reporting was effective based on criteria set forth by COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. The attestation report
concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of September30, 2008, issued by Ernst Young LLP, the
independent registered public accounting firm who also audited our consolidated
financial statements is included following this Item 9A. Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting
as defined in Rules13a-15fand 15d-15funder the Exchange
Act identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal control that
occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2008 that has materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting. 62 Table of Contents REPORT
OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Shareholders of MAXIMUS,Inc. We have audited MAXIMUS,Inc.s
internal control over financial reporting as of September30, 2008, based
on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. MAXIMUS,Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, MAXIMUS,Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September30,
2008, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements of MAXIMUS,Inc., as of September30,
2008 and our report dated December10, 2008 except for Note 14a as to
which the date is December 12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ Ernst
