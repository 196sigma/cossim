Item8.Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements as of
December31, 2002, and for each of the fiscal years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2002, together with
related notes and the report of Deloitte Touche LLP are
set forth on the following pages. MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR
FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of The Dial Corporation has the
responsibility for preparing and assuring the integrity and
objectivity of the accompanying financial statements and other
financial information in this report. The financial statements
were prepared using generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. The financial statements reflect, where
applicable, managements best estimates and judgments and
include disclosures and explanations that are relevant to an
understanding of our financial affairs. Our financial statements have been audited by
Deloitte Touche LLP. Management has made available to
Deloitte Touche LLP all of our financial records and other
relevant data and has made appropriate and complete written and
oral representations and disclosures in connection with the
audit. Management has established and maintains a system
of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are authorized and properly
recorded, that assets are protected and that materially
inaccurate financial reporting is prevented and detected. The
appropriate segregation of responsibilities and careful
selection of employees are components of the system of internal
controls. The internal control system is independently monitored
and evaluated by an internal auditing program. The Board of Directors, acting through its Audit
Committee, oversees the adequacy of our internal control
environment. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management
representatives and, jointly and separately, with
representatives of Deloitte Touche LLP and internal
auditing management to review accounting, auditing and financial
reporting matters.

35 Table of Contents INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Dial Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Dial Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2002, and 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income loss, cash
flows and stockholders equity for each of the three years
in the period ended December31, 2002. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of The Dial Corporation and subsidiaries as
of December31, 2002, and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives as required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets, which was effective January1,
2002.

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Note 1.Nature of
Business We manufacture and sell consumer products. We
market our products primarily under such well-known household
brand names as Dial soaps,
Purex detergents,
Renuzit air fresheners and
Armour canned meats. These products are sold
to consumers primarily though supermarkets, mass merchandisers,
drug stores, membership club stores and other outlets.
Approximately 96% of our business is in the United States. On December23, 2002, we announced the
pending sale of our Argentina business. The sale is subject to
satisfaction of negotiated closing conditions and receipt of
approvals under Argentinas antitrust and bulk transfer
laws. The sale is expected to close late in the second quarter
of 2003. As a result of this pending sale, Argentinas
current and historical earnings have been reclassified to a
discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements. On August28, 2001, we completed the sale of
our Specialty Personal Care SPC business. The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared to reflect
our historical financial position and results of operations and
cash flows as adjusted for the reclassification of the SPC
business as a discontinued operation. The historical results of
operations of the SPC business up to its date of disposition and
the estimated loss on the sale of SPC are reported as a
discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. We believe that our long-term interests and those
of our shareholders would be best served if we were part of a
larger enterprise. We continue to focus on improving our
operating results as a standalone company and we will also
continue to explore opportunities to become part of a larger
company, which could include transactions with multiple parties.
No time constraints have been set for any transaction, and any
decision regarding any potential transactions will be based upon
the best interests of our shareholders. Accordingly, there is no
assurance that any sale, merger or other transactions involving
us or any of our businesses will occur in the near future or at
all. Note
2.Significant Accounting
Policies Principles of
Consolidation. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The
Dial Corporation and all majority-owned subsidiaries. Prior to
our assumption of Henkels interest in Dial/Henkel
LLCs operations in the second quarter of 2002, we
accounted for our investment in the Dial/Henkel LLC joint
venture and our prior investment in the Dial/ Henkel Mexico
joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
Intercompany transactions and profits have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of Estimates.
The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We routinely
evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer
programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, income
taxes, pension and other post-retirement benefits, long-lived
assets, inventories, restructurings, self insurance primarily
workers compensation, environmental matters, exit cost
reserves related to discontinued operations and contingencies
and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions and conditions. Revenue Recognition.
Sales are recorded when the risk of
loss and title to the product transfers to the purchaser. Sales
are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts, estimated
sales returns, trade promotions and other sales incentives. Major Customers.
Wal-Mart, including its affiliate
Sams Club, was our largest customer, accounting for 28 25%, and 22% of net sales in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The loss of or a substantial decrease 41 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued in the volume of purchases by Wal-Mart or any of
our other top customers could harm our sales and profitability. In January 2002, Kmart Corporation filed for
Chapter11 bankruptcy protection. Kmart is one of our top
ten customers. We sell certain products to Kmart primarily
through Kmarts distributor, Fleming Companies, Inc., but
we also sell products to Kmart directly. Kmart and Fleming have
recently announced that Fleming will no longer be Kmarts
contracted distributor. As a result, during 2003, we will begin
to sell our products directly to Kmart. Kmart has already closed approximately
300stores and recently announced plans to close
approximately 300additional stores in its effort to emerge
from bankruptcy. Our sales to Kmart have decreased as a result
of these store closings and from a decline in consumers visiting
Kmarts open stores. To date, Kmarts bankruptcy has
not had a material adverse effect on our planned sales or
operating results. However, the additional store closings and
potential change of Kmarts distribution system could have
an adverse impact on our sales and operating results in 2003. Net sales to the food and mass channels
represented 787%, 790%, and 789% of our domestic sales in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Marketing and Research and Development Costs.
All expenditures for marketing and
research and development are charged against earnings in the
period incurred and are reported in the statement of
consolidated operations under the caption Selling,
general and administrative expenses. Our total
research and development expenditures were approximately
$162million, $143million and $121million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Marketing costs include the
costs of advertising and various consumer related marketing
programs. Cash and Cash Equivalents.
We consider all highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less
from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Inventories.
Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost first in, first out and average cost methods or market. Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives.
In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets, we evaluate the recoverability of property and
equipment and intangibles with definite lives not held for sale
by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets
against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the asset or group of assets and their
eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less
than the carrying value of the asset or group of assets being
evaluated, an impairment loss is recorded. The loss is measured
as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of
the asset or group of assets being evaluated. Assets to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
the fair value less cost to sell. The estimated fair value is
based on the best information available under the circumstances,
including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation
techniques, including the present value of expected future cash
flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks
involved. Intangibles with definite lives primarily consisting
of patents are amortized using the straight-line method over the
period of expected benefit. Property and Equipment.
Property and equipment are stated at
cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided
principally by use of the straight-line method at annual rates
as follows   
Buildings
2% to 5%
Machinery and other equipment
5% to 33%
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of lease term or useful life
42 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Goodwill and Intangibles.
Prior to 2002, goodwill that arose
prior to November 1970 was not amortized, but other goodwill and
intangibles with indefinite lives were amortized over useful
lives ranging from 10 to 40years. Effective
January1, 2002, all goodwill and other intangibles with
indefinite lives ceased to be amortized. Intangible assets with
indefinite lives are analyzed for impairment, on at least an
annual basis, as required by the SFAS No142. Other intangible assets with definite lives,
including trademarks, patents and customer lists, are amortized
over useful lives ranging from 10 to 40years. Intangible
assets with definite lives are analyzed for impairment as
required by the SFAS No144. Net Income Loss Per Common Share.
Basic net income lossper
common share is computed by dividing net income lossby
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year before giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted net income loss per
common share is computed by dividing net income lossby
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the year after giving effect to stock options considered to be
dilutive common stock equivalents. Shares held by the Employee
Equity Trust are not considered outstanding for net income
loss per share calculations until the shares are released from
the Trust and transferred to an employee or transferred on
behalf of an employee. In accordance with SFAS No128,
Earnings per share, the same number of potential
common shares used in calculating the diluted earnings per share
for income from continuing operations is used in calculating all
other reported diluted earnings per share amounts. At December31, 2002, there were 106,372,531
shares of common stock issued and there were 95,462,098 shares
outstanding, including shares held by the Employee Equity Trust.
At December31, 2002, and December31, 2001, a total
of 2,365,901 and 3,175,315, respectively, of the issued shares
were held by the Employee Equity Trust. At December31,
2002, and December31, 2001, a total of 10,910,433 and
10,847,386 shares of common stock, respectively, were held in
treasury. In addition to common stock, we are authorized to
issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value of
$01per share, none of which has been issued. Stock Options. We
have two stock-based employee compensation plans, which are
described in more detail in Note15. We account for these
plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB
Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations. We have adopted
the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended
by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the
stock option plans. Awards under our plans vest over periods

New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No148, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This
Statement amends SFAS No123 to provide alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation.
Specifically, SFAS No148 prohibits companies from
utilizing the prospective method of transition, the only method
offered under the original SFAS No123, in fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2003. However, the statement
permits two additional transition methods for companies that
adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation, which include the modified prospective and
retroactive restatement methods. Under the prospective method,
expense is recognized for all employee awards granted, modified,
or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
recognition provisions are first applied. The modified
prospective method recognizes stock-based employee compensation
cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
provisions are first applied, as if the fair value method had
been used to account for all employee awards granted, modified,
or settled in fiscal years beginning after December15,
1994. Under the retroactive restatement method, all periods
presented are restated to reflect stock-based employee
compensation cost under the fair value method for all employee
awards granted, modified, or settled in fiscal years beginning
after December15, 1994. In addition, this Statement amends
the disclosure requirements of SFAS No123 to require
prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial
statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results with a prescribed specific tabular format and
requiring disclosure in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies or its equivalent. We have adopted the
new disclosure requirements for 2002, and are evaluating the
impact if we were to adopt the fair value method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation under all three methods. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB
Interpretation No. FIN 45, Guarantors
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. This
Interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to
recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation
undertaken in issuing a guarantee and requires certain related
disclosures. Currently, under such guarantees we could be liable
for lease payments extending through 2006 with minimum lease
payments totaling approximately $76million. We are
currently analyzing the impact of FIN No45 on our
business. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities. SFAS No146 supersedes guidance
established in the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF Issue No94-3 regarding certain exit
and disposal costs. The provisions of this Statement are 44 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued effective for exit or disposal activities that
are initiated after December31, 2002. We do not anticipate
a financial impact as a result of this Statement. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No145,
Rescission of Statements No4, 44, and 64, Amendment
of SFAS No13, and Technical Corrections. This
Statement rescinds SFAS No4 that required all gains and
losses from the extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if
material, classified as an extraordinary item. Gains and losses
from the extinguishment of debt will no longer be considered
extraordinary. SFAS No145 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after May15, 2002. As part of our capital
allocation strategy, we are currently considering repurchasing
debt. We are currently evaluating the financial impact of this
statement on a debt-repurchasing plan. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets. This statement supersedes SFAS
No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, and
the accounting and reporting provisions of the Accounting
Principles Board APB Opinion No30,
Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting
the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions, for the disposal of a segment of a business
as previously defined in the Opinion. There was no effect from
adopting SFAS No144 effective January1, 2002, as
required. In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Under the
provisions of SFAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to
annual impairment tests. SFAS No142 also established a
new method of testing goodwill for impairment. We adopted SFAS
No142 effective January1, 2002 and ceased the
amortization of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives.
Amortization expense of these items was $73million
pre-tax $005 per diluted share and $66million pre-tax
$005 per diluted share, respectively in 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge on
our Argentina intangible assets from the change in accounting
principle in the first quarter of 2002. The amount of this
charge was $433million after tax $440million
pre-tax and is included in Cumulative effect of the change
in accounting principle line on the consolidated statement
of operations and comprehensive income. In August 2001, the FASB issued EITF release
Issue No01-09, Accounting for Consideration Given
by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendors
Products. EITF01-09 consolidates the previously
discussed Issue No00-14 Accounting for Certain
Sales Incentives and Issue No00-25 Vendor
Income Statement Characterization of Consideration Paid to a
Reseller of the Vendors Products. EITF01-09
does not change the accounting treatment set forth by
EITF00-14 and EITF00-25. We adopted EITF01-09
effective January1, 2002. The implementation of EITF01-09 requires a
change to the way we previously classified certain sales
incentives that were previously recorded as selling, general and
administrative expenses. We have restated our historical net
sales, cost of sales, and selling, general and administrative
expense as a result of the implementation of the consensus of
Issue01-09. The following table illustrates the effect of the
changes from adopting EITF01-09.

45 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Derivative Financial Instruments.
Effective January1, 2001, we
adopted SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No133
requires that all derivative financial instruments that qualify
for hedge accounting, such as interest rate swap contracts and
forward purchase contracts, be recognized in the financial
statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose
or intent for holding them. Changes in the fair value of
derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income
or stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive
income, depending on whether the derivative is being used to
hedge changes in fair value or cash flows. Our use of financial instruments is limited to
purposes other than trading and includes the management of
interest rate risk. The financial impacts of these hedging
instruments are offset in part or in whole by corresponding
changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We may use
financial instruments for the management of foreign currency,
employee benefits, commodity expense or other risks in the
future.   
Note3.
Special Items   
2002 Special Items Pre-Tax Gain
of $38million We recorded a net gain of $17million
$09million after-tax associated with the sale of our
Mexico manufacturing facility and the reversal of special item
reserves established in 2001 and 2000, which were deemed no
longer necessary, offset in part by a writedown of the carrying
value of our Guatemala manufacturing facility. In addition, we
recorded a $21million gain associated with the previously
dissolved Dial/ Henkel joint ventures for the reversal of
reserves that were no longer required.   
2001 Special Items Pre-Tax
Charge of $88million On August30, 2001, we announced a special
charge to consolidate manufacturing facilities in the United
States and Argentina. In addition, in the third quarter of 2001
we incurred a special charge in connection with the closure of
our Mexico City manufacturing facility. Excluding the Argentina
portion of the charge, which has been reclassified to
discontinued operations, we recorded charges of
$98million $83million after-tax during 2001.
During 2001, we also recorded $10million, pre-tax, of
special item reserves established in 2000, which were no longer
deemed necessary. We recorded employee separation charges related
to severance packages for 64 manufacturing employees in the
United States and 69 manufacturing and 33 general, selling and
administrative employees in Mexico. The predominately
involuntary packages were based on salary levels and past
service and were recorded upon acceptance of the package. We wrote down the carrying value of the Compton
and Mexico manufacturing plants by approximately
$19million. As a result of the closure of our Mexico
manufacturing facility, some inventory, primarily raw material,
became unusable. Accordingly, a charge was recorded for the
difference between cost and net realizable value. We expensed the $28million cumulative
currency translation adjustment previously recorded to other
comprehensive loss in stockholders equity that related to
our Mexico operations.   
2000 Special Items Pre-Tax
Charge of $478million On June28, 2000 and on October18,
2000, we announced special items related to the Specialty
Personal Care business, the Dial/ Henkel joint ventures,
severance costs for prior management and other actions to
improve operational efficiencies. The special charges related to
the Dial/ Henkel joint ventures totaling $305million
pre-tax are discussed in Note 6 and excluded from this note.
Excluding the joint venture and the Specialty Personal Care and
Argentina portions of the charge, which have been reclassified
to discontinued operations, we recorded charges of
$173million during 2000. 46 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued We recorded employee separation charges related
to severance packages for three prior executive officers,
80manufacturing employees located in the United States and
103 primarily general, selling and administrative employees
located in the United States and Mexico. The executive severance
charges were recorded based either on contractual agreements or
in accordance with our policies. The remaining severance charges
were predominately involuntary packages and are based on salary
levels and past service and were recorded upon acceptance of the
package. We recorded accelerated depreciation on the
Bristol, Pennsylvania plant during 2000 for assets that were
taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service
lives. Accordingly, we changed the estimated useful lives of
such assets, resulting in accelerated depreciation. We also
wrote down the carrying value of this plant and certain other
assets by approximately $54million. The following table shows the components of these
special items and changes to related reserves during 2002, 2001

Note4.Acquisition
of Businesses In the second quarter of 2000, we acquired two
businesses for $722million in cash. The acquisitions
included the Coast bar soap and the Zout stain remover
businesses in the United States. In 2002 and 2001 we made
additional earnout payments of $11million and
$09million for the Zout business due to the achievement
of specified level of gross sales. A final earnout payment will
be made in 2003 if a specified level of gross sales of Zout
product is achieved. The results of operations of the
acquired businesses are included in our consolidated results of
operations from their respective acquisition dates. The total
combined net sales of the acquisitions, from their respective
acquisition dates through the end of 2000, was
$228million. In addition, we acquired the Plusbelle hair care
business in Argentina during the second quarter of 2000 for
$479million in cash and assumed $13million in
liabilities. The Plusbelle hair care business has been
reclassified as a discontinued operation effective with the
pending sale of Dial Argentina. Note5.Discontinued
Operations Argentina
Operations In December
2002, we announced that we had reached an agreement to sell our
Argentina business to an entity designated by Southern Cross
Group, a private equity investor in Argentina. The transaction
is structured as the sale of assets of Dial Argentina, S.A.,
which includes the stock of its two subsidiaries, Sulfargen,
S.A. and The Dial Corporation San Juan, S.A. The sale is subject
to satisfaction of negotiated closing conditions and receipt of
approvals under Argentinas antitrust and bulk transfer
laws. The sale currently is expected to close late in the second
quarter of 2003. The sales price is $60million resulting
in 47 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued tax benefits of approximately $61million.
As a result, we recorded an after-tax loss of $624million
on the pending disposal and classified our Argentina business as
a discontinued operation. This non-cash loss includes the
reversal of the $928million currency translation
adjustment that had previously been recorded as a reduction of
equity and an accrual for estimated exit and closing costs. In
the first quarter of 2002, we also recorded an after-tax
impairment charge of $433million for the Argentina
business as a result of adopting the SFAS No142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The tax rates on the loss on disposal and the
impairment charge were 494% and 45% respectively. These rates
differ from federal statutory rate in that no tax benefit was
provided on the impairment charge related to nondeductible
goodwill which becomes fully deductible on the disposal of Dial
Argentina. The combined tax rate for these related items is
369%. The results of the discontinued Argentina
operation are as follows, in thousands

Specialty Personal
Care On August28,
2001, we completed the sale of our Specialty Personal Care
SPCbusiness. Businesses included in the sale segment
consisted of a variety of skin, hair, bath, body and foot care
products sold under the Freeman and Sarah Michaels brand names.
The sale was in line with our strategy to fix or jettison
under-performing businesses. As a result of the sale, we
recorded an after-tax loss of $1984million related to the
write-off of assets and to record an accrual for estimated exit
costs. Proceeds from the sale were primarily used to repay debt.
As a result of this transaction, we sold the stock of our
wholly-owned subsidiary, Sarah Michaels, Inc., and the
inventories, fixed assets and intangibles of the business, but
retained the related receivables and liabilities arising on or
prior to closing. 48 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued As consideration for the sale, we received
aggregate purchase price consideration of $120million,
which consisted of $80million in cash and two
subordinated promissory notes in the amount of $20million
each. On December31, 2001, the $40million in
promissory notes had not been recorded by us because of
uncertainties regarding the realizability of such amounts. In
the first quarter of 2002, we entered into an agreement with the
buyer of this business to resolve disputes that arose in
connection with the sale. Under the terms of that agreement, we
received full payment on one of these notes, forgave the other
note and agreed to bear the cost of some disputed expenses. In
the first quarter of 2002, we recorded the $20million
$13million after-tax received as a reduction of the
loss previously recognized on the sale of the business. In the
fourth quarter of 2002, we further reduced the loss previously
recorded on the disposal of the business by $40million
$25million after-tax as a result of reversing certain
exit cost accruals because of lower than expected costs
associated with exiting the discontinued operation. At
December31, 2002, we still have approximately
$144million of accruals related to the discontinued
business, primarily for future operating lease payments. As a result of the loss recognized on the sale,
we recorded a current tax benefit of approximately
$400million. This tax benefit resulted in cash savings in
the third and fourth quarters of 2001 and the first nine months
of 2002. The loss on the sale is primarily comprised of the
write-off of goodwill and inventories. In addition, the sale
resulted in approximately $523million in capital losses
for which no tax benefits were provided. We will realize
benefits on that capital loss only to the extent that we
generate capital gains within five years of the sale. The results of the discontinued SPC business are

The consolidated financial statements included in

financial position and results of operations and cash flows as
adjusted for the reclassification of the business as a
discontinued operation. The historical results of operations of
the business up to its date of disposition and the estimated
loss on the sale are reported as a discontinued operation in the
consolidated financial statements. Note 6.Dial/
Henkel Joint Ventures In April1999, we formed Dial/ Henkel LLC, a
joint venture with Henkel KGaA of Dsseldorf, Germany. Dial
and Henkel each owned 50% of this joint venture. This joint
venture was formed to develop and market a range of enhanced
laundry products in North America. In 1999, this joint venture
acquired the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning business
and launched the Purex Advanced laundry detergent line. In March2000, we formed another joint
venture with Henkel named Dial/ Henkel Mexico S.A. de C.V.
Henkel owned 51% and Dial owned 49% of this joint venture. This
joint venture was formed primarily to develop and market
consumer detergent and household cleaning products in Mexico. In
May2000, this joint venture acquired 80% of Fabrica de
Jabon Mariano Salgado, S.A.de C.V., a manufacturer and
marketer of consumer detergents and household cleaning products
in Mexico. During the third quarter of 2000, the Dial/
Henkel LLC joint venture decided to discontinue operations of
Purex Advanced laundry detergent. As a result, in 2000
the Dial/ Henkel LLC joint venture reflected Purex 49 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Advanced as a
discontinued operation and the joint venture recorded special
charges to writedown its inventories and establish reserves for
exit costs. Our portion of the loss on disposal of Purex
Advanced is $126million and is included in the
special charge portion of the Loss of Dial/ Henkel joint
ventures on our books. In addition, we recorded a charge of
$54million to write down to net realizable value of fixed
assets used to manufacture Purex Advanced. During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Dial/
Henkel LLC joint venture recorded a $15million special
charge relating to the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning
business. This charge consisted of recording inventory at net
realizable value and writing down impaired goodwill and deferred
tax assets. Our share of this charge was $75million and
is included on our books in the special charge portion of the
Loss of Dial/ Henkel joint ventures. In December2000, we sold our interest in
the Dial/ Henkel Mexico joint venture to Henkel for
$189million, and recorded a $50million loss as
part of the previously announced special charges. In 2000, the
Dial/ Henkel Mexico joint venture had $327million in
sales and our share of the operating loss was $05million. In the third quarter of 2001, Dial/ Henkel LLC
discontinued the Custom Cleaner home dry cleaning
business. In the second quarter of 2002, Henkel received
certain intellectual property rights related to the former
Custom Cleaner business in exchange for their interest in
Dial/ Henkel LLC, which had no operations in 2002. Prior to our
assumption of Henkels interest in Dial/ Henkel LLC, we
accounted for this joint venture under the equity method of
accounting. During 2002, we recorded a $21million gain
related to lower than expected costs associated with the
discontinued Custom Cleaner business. Our
$30million share of the joint ventures net income
in 2001 resulted from lower than expected marketing costs of the
Custom Cleaner and Purex Advanced businesses and
lower than expected costs of exiting the joint venture. In 2000,
the two Dial/ Henkel joint ventures resulted in net losses to us
of $376million, which included $305million in
special charges related to exit activities. These results are

The Dial/ Henkel LLC agreement provided for a
monthly marketing, sales and administrative fee, a trademark fee
and a tolling fee paid to us during 2000. A monthly technology
fee was paid to Henkel. In addition, during 2000 Henkel paid a
disproportionate share of the marketing expenses of Purex
Advanced incurred by the Dial/ Henkel LLC joint venture.
During the joint ventures exit activities, disproportionate
losses were taken by the partners of the joint venture based on
negotiations between the joint venture partners. 50 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Income Gain on Special Items During the second quarter of 2000, we sold the
Dial Center for Innovation DCI, formerly known as
the Dial Technical and Administration Center, and accompanying
23-acre parcel in Scottsdale, Arizona to an unrelated third
party developer for a purchase price of $153million. At
that time, we entered into an operating lease with this third
party for the existing DCI building pending construction of a
new DCI building. The land and building have been removed from
our consolidated balance sheet and a gain of $67million
related to the sale of land was recognized in 2000. In the
fourth quarter of 2000, we paid the buyer $42million and
in return, our obligation to construct a new building was
replaced by an exclusive option to construct a new DCI building.
This option expires in the second quarter of 2003. The lease on
our existing DCI building expires August2008. During 2000, we recorded a $46million
curtailment gain resulting from changes to retiree medical plan
benefits. Note

Additions to goodwill were the result of the Zout
earnout.
In connection with the implementation of SFAS
No142, effective January1, 2002, we ceased
amortizing our intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Amortization expense of these items was $73million and
$66million in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization
expense, net of tax, was approximately $51million and
$46million in 2001 and 2000 respectively, or $005 per
diluted share in both years. Accordingly, net loss and net loss
per diluted share, excluding this amortization expense, would
have been $1272million or $138 per diluted share in
2001, and $64million or $007 per diluted share in 2000.
For the year ended December31, 2002 amortization of
intangibles with definite lives was $01million and is not
expected to materially change in the near future. Effective January1, 2002, we recorded a
$433million after-tax impairment $440million
pre-tax to intangibles as a result of implementing SFAS
No142. See Note5 for further discussion of this
impairment charge.

In the third quarter of 2001, we entered into two
interest rate swap contracts which effectively converted our
$250million 7% Senior Notes due in 2006, to floating rate
debt. We designated the swaps as fair value hedges. Accordingly,
the fair value of the swaps was recorded as an asset and the
carrying value of the underlying debt was increased by an equal
amount in accordance with SFASNo133. During the
third quarter of 2002, the swaps were terminated resulting in a
net gain of $134million. The gain is recorded with total
reported debt and will be amortized as a reduction of interest
expense over the remaining term of the $250million 7%
Senior Notes due 2006. We also have outstanding $200million of
65% Senior Notes due 2008, which were issued in 1998. The
Indenture governing these Senior Notes also imposes restrictions
with respect to, among other things, our ability to place liens
on certain properties and enter into certain sale and leaseback
transactions. We have outstanding $250million of 70%
Senior Notes due 2006, which were issued in 2001. The Indenture
governing these Senior Notes imposes restrictions with respect
to, among other things, our ability to place liens on certain
properties and enter into certain sale and leaseback
transactions. In addition, the Indenture governing these Senior
Notes requires us to purchase from the holders of the Senior
Notes, upon the exercise of such purchase right by each holder,
all or any part of their Senior Notes at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes plus
interest, upon the occurrence of either ia change of
control of Dial that is followed by a rating decline or
iia significant asset sale yielding gross proceeds to us
of $500million or more in the aggregate that is followed
by a rating decline. A rating decline is deemed to
have occurred if, no later than 90days after the public
notice of either the occurrence or intention to effect a change
of control or significant asset sale, either of the rating
agencies assigns a rating to the Senior Notes that is lower than
Baa3, in the case of a rating by Moodys, or BBB-, in the
case of a rating by Standard Poors. The events of default under the indentures
governing our Senior Notes include the following   
failure to pay principal or interest when due
failure to comply with covenants
commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization
default under any other indebtedness for borrowed
money having an aggregate principal amount outstanding of at
least $50million, which default results in such
indebtedness being declared due and payable prior to its
maturity date
In the first quarter of 2002, we terminated our
credit facility and replaced it with a new $150million
revolving credit facility. The new facility is comprised of two
commitments: $75million under commitments available until
March 2005 and $75million under commitments available
until March 2003. In May of 2002, this new credit facility was
increased to $200million, with $100million available
until March 2005 and 53 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued 100million available until March 2003. The
credit facility requires us to pay commitment fees to the
lenders. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at our
option, at the banks prime rate or LIBOR plus a credit
spread. The credit spread and the commitment fees paid for the
facility are subject to adjustment should our debt ratings
change. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility at
December31, 2002. In the first quarter of 2003, we expect
to renew the $100million of commitments that expire in
March 2003 under the same terms and conditions Our credit facility requires us to maintain a
minimum net worth of $100million plus 50% of net income
if positive earned from the date of the facility. For purposes
of calculating our minimum net worth, we exclude foreign
currency translation gains or losses, gains or losses relating
to any sale or other disposition of our Argentina operations
and/or the Armour food business and the $433million
after-tax impairment charge taken in the first quarter of 2002
for Argentina. We also are limited to a maximum ratio of funded
debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization EBITDAof 30 to 10. Our credit facility
also limits our ability to incur additional unsecured
indebtedness, sell, lease or transfer assets, enter into sale
and leaseback transactions, place liens on properties and
complete certain acquisitions without our lenders consent. The events of default under our $200million
credit facility include the following   
failure to pay principal or interest when due
failure to comply with covenants, representations
and warranties under the credit agreement
default in the payment of, or failure to comply
with covenants relating to, other indebtedness with a principal
amount outstanding of at least $15million
default under any material contract which results
in liabilities or damages in excess of $25million
commencing any proceeding for bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization
entry of a final, non-appealable judgment in
excess of $25million
a change in control of Dial
At December31, 2002, we were in compliance
with all covenants under our credit facility, our
$250million of 70% Senior Notes due 2006 and our
$200million of 65% Senior Notes due 2008. Interest expense incurred in 2002, 2001 and 2000
was, in thousands, $29,922, $36,797 and $42,386, respectively.
Interest paid to lenders in 2002, 2001 and 2000 was, in
thousands, $29,890, $37,071 and $40,896, respectively. The fair
value of our Senior Notes was, in thousands, $477,687 and

SFAS109, Accounting for Income
Taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established
when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a
deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in the
valuation allowance from period to period are included in the
tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a
valuation allowance is required, we take into account all
evidence with regard to utilization of the deferred tax asset
including our past earnings history, expected future earnings,
the character and jurisdiction of such earnings and carryback
and carryforward periods. In 2001, we established a full valuation
allowance for $194million of deferred tax assets related
to the $523million capital loss from the sale of the
Specialty Personal Care business in 2001. This capital loss can
only be utilized to offset net capital gains, and will expire on
December31, 2006. As of December31, 2002, we
continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against the
potential future tax benefits of the capital loss carryforward.
We expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on
the potential future tax benefits of the capital loss
carryforward until it is more likely than not that the capital
losses will be utilized. Also included in the 2001 deferred tax assets was
$20million related to a foreign tax loss, for which a
full valuation allowance was provided. The foreign tax loss
carryover expired unused in 2002, and the carryover was
eliminated from the valuation allowance in 2002. Also included
in 2002 was $63million of net operating loss
carryforwards reattributed from a disposed subsidiary. U.S. income tax is not provided when foreign
earnings are indefinitely reinvested in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No23,
Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas. We
determine whether our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will
invest a significant portion of their undistributed earnings
indefinitely. We reassess our determination on a periodic basis.
Changes to our determination may be warranted based on our
experience as well as plans regarding future international
operations and expected tax payments. Changes in the
determination from period to period are included in our tax
provision in the period of change. As of December31, 2002,
we had not provided for any U.S. taxes on approximately
$140million of undistributed earnings from our non-U.S.
subsidiaries since these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Note 14.Pension
and Other Benefits Pension Plans.
Trusteed, noncontributory pension
plans cover substantially all employees, with benefit levels
supplemented in most cases by defined matching contributions to
employees 401k plans. We amended the pension plan to
calculate benefits using an age and pay-based credit formula
beginning January1, 2001. Under the former plan, defined
benefits were based primarily on final average salary and years
of service. The accrued pension benefit under the former plan
was frozen as of December31, 2000, and will grow to
reflect increases in employees base pay. Funding policies
provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be
at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable
regulations. 56 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Note 15.Stock
Options On August15, 1996, we were spun-off from
our former parent. Options granted between 1990 and 1996 to
certain officers and employees to acquire our common stock were
granted under our former parents stock option plans. These
options have been adjusted for stock splits and the spin-off in
1996. These options were 59 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued granted at the market prices on the dates of
grant, became exercisable 50% after one year and 100% after two
years and expire after 10years. No additional options will
be granted under these plans. We adopted The Dial Corporation Stock Incentive
Plan in 1996 1996 Plan, which is administered by
the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
Under the 1996 Plan, the aggregate number of shares of common
and preferred stock covered by awards to any one individual
cannot exceed 1,000,000 shares for any three-year period and no
more than 9,600,000 shares are cumulatively available for
options intended to qualify as incentive stock
options under the Internal Revenue Code. The term of the
options is 10years. The Plan provides that options are
generally to be granted at the market price on the date of
grant; however, the 1996 Executive Compensation Committee may
grant options at less than such market price. The 1996 Plan also
authorizes the issuance of stock appreciation rights and
restricted stock. During the year ended December31, 2002,
no stock appreciation rights or restricted stock were awarded. Under the 1996 Plan, options to purchase 345,456
shares were granted at the market price on the dates of grant
during 2002. These options, which are all classified as
non-qualified options, become one-third exercisable after one
year, two-thirds exercisable after two years, and 100%
exercisable after three years. The options expire after
10years. During 2002, options to purchase 51,800 shares
were also granted to non-employee members of the Board of
Directors at the market price on the date of grant. Of these
options issued, 50,600 are exercisable 50% after one year and
100% after two years, while the balance of 1,200 shares, which
were issued in exchange for director fees, are 100% exercisable
on the date of grant. The options expire after 10years. A summary of the status of our stock option plans

We apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25 and related interpretations in accounting for our
stock option plans. We have adopted the disclosure-only
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
SFAS No123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by
SFASNo148. Accordingly, no compensation cost has
been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation
cost for our stock option plans been determined based on the
fair value at the grant date consistent with the provisions of
SFASNo123 and the amendment of
SFASNo148, our net income lossand net
income lossper share would have been reduced to the pro
forma amounts indicated below. Average assumptions used in determining the
estimated fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes
valuation model, and the estimated fair values are as follows.

We adopted The Dial Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESPP in 2000. Under this plan, up to
650,000 shares of common stock may be purchased by eligible
employees through payroll deductions of 61 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued up to 15% of their eligible compensation, not to
exceed $25,000. The purchase price is equal to the lesser of
a85% of the fair market value of the stock on first day
of the offering period or b85% of the fair market value
of the stock on the last day of the offering period. During
2002, employees purchased approximately 54,191shares under
this plan.   
Note16.
Leases Certain sales, warehouse and administration
offices and equipment are leased. These leases expire in periods
ranging generally from one to five years, and some provide for
renewal options ranging from one to eight years. Leases that
expire are generally renewed or replaced by similar leases,
depending on business needs at that time. Net rent paid in 2002,
2001 and 2000 totaled, in thousands, $12,186, $13,032, $13,589,
respectively. At December31, 2002, our future minimum

sub-lease agreements on non-cancelable leases that we hold. The
total rental obligation related to these sub-leases for 2003,
2004, 2005 and 2006, in thousands, are $2,455, $2,457, $1,826

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet
Risk Our use of financial instruments is limited to
purposes other than trading and primarily includes management of
interest rate and commodity expense. We may use financial
instruments for the management of interest rate risk or other
risks in the future.   
Interest Rate Risk Management At December31, 2002, we had
$4462million in long-term debt outstanding, comprised of
$200million $1988million net of issue discount of
65% Senior Notes due 2008, and $250million
$2475million net of issue discount of 70% bonds due
2006. Our Senior Notes fixed interest rates to maturity. At the time of the issuance of the
$250million 7% bonds due 2006, we entered into two
interest rate swaps, which together were designated as hedges of
that issue. The interest rate swaps had a total notional amount
of $250million. In August of 2002, the interest rate swaps
were terminated and we received a payment of $134million.
The gain on the termination of the swaps was deferred and is
classified as a part of long-term debt. The deferred gain will
be amortized over the remaining term of the $250million 7%
bonds as a reduction of interest expense. The amortization of
the gain on the terminated swaps effectively reduces the fixed
rate of the $250million 7% notes to approximately 54%
annually. We are currently investing our accumulated cash
balance in a variety of short-term investment vehicles with low
principle risk. The weighted average yield on the invested cash
at December31, 2002 was 143%. Each 50 basis point change
in the yield on the invested cash would result in an approximate
$12 million change in our other expense, net. 62 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued In January 2003, we entered into two interest
rate swaps contracts that effectively changes the interest rate
on a portion of our Senior Notes from fixed to variable. The
total notional value of the interest rate swaps that expire in
September 2008 is $200million, effectively converting 45%
of our total debt to variable interest rates. Under the terms of
the swaps, we pay a variable rate of interest based on a 6-month
LIBOR plus 278basis points and receive a fixed interest of
65%. Variable interest rates are paid and reset semi-annually.
The Six-Month LIBOR rate on January9, 2003 was 139%. The
interest rate swaps expose us to the risk of changes in LIBOR
based interest rates. Each 50basis point change in the
swaps floating rate would change our pre-tax interest
expense by $1million.   
Foreign Currency We are exposed to risks from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, primarily U.S. Dollar/ Canadian
Dollar and U.S. Dollar/ Argentine Peso. Historically, the Argentine Pesos value has
been pegged by the Argentine government as equal to
the U.S.Dollar. However, in late December 2001, the
Argentine government declared strict limitations on bank
withdrawals, effectively blocking all convertibility of
Argentine Pesos to U.S.Dollars at December31, 2001.
On February12, 2002, the Argentine Government abandoned
the dual exchange rate and allowed the Argentine Peso to float
freely against other currencies. During 2002, the
U.S.Dollar/ Argentine Peso exchange rate fluctuated
between 1:16 and 1:39. If there were a 10% change in the
exchange rates for the U.S.Dollar to the Argentine Peso
from those at December31, 2002 until the expected sale
date, the gain or loss would be immaterial. At December31, 2002, one U.S.Dollar
was worth 16 Canadian Dollars. For the year ended
December31, 2002, the U.S.Dollar/ Canadian Dollar
exchange rate fluctuated between a high of 1:16 to 1:15. If
there were a 10% change in the exchange rates for the
U.S.Dollar to the Canadian Dollar from those at
December31, 2002, the foreign currency gain or loss would
be immaterial.   
Employee Benefit Plan Expense We offer our directors and management deferred
compensation plans. Under these plans, participants can defer a
portion of their compensation into either Dial stock units or
various cash accounts. For deferrals made into stock units,
deferred compensation due to participants is included on the
balance sheet in Stockholders Equity under the caption
Employee Benefits with no recognition of any
investment gains or losses. The deferred funds are placed in a
Rabbi Trust using shares of Dial common stock. The Trust is also
included on the balance sheet in Stockholders Equity under
the caption Employee Benefits. For deferrals into cash accounts, deferred
compensation due to participants and any accumulated investment
gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as a liability
under the captions Pension and other benefits
and Other Liabilities. We place the
deferred funds in a Rabbi Trust, which purchases life insurance
policies on the participants lives, with Dial as the
beneficiary. The policies have cash surrender value that accrues
tax-free earnings largely based on the performance of the
SP 500. The cash surrender value asset and any accumulated
investment gains or losses are included on the balance sheet as
an asset under the caption Other assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
receivables, accounts payable and short-term bank borrowings
approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of
these instruments. The fair value of our Senior Notes is
estimated based upon quoted market prices. The fair value of the
Senior Notes was $4777million at December31, 2002. 63 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued Note18.Segments
of an Enterprise We are organized into two business segments:
iDomestic Branded and iiInternational and Other.
The segments were identified based on the economic
characteristics, types of products sold, the customer base and
method of distribution. Effective January1, 2002, we began
to include the International operating segment in the
International and Other business segment due to its immaterial
size. Prior to January1, 2002, we included sales of
industrial chemicals, which includes soap pellets and chemicals,
principally glycerin and fatty acids that are by-products of the
soap making process, in the International and Other business
segment. Effective January1, 2002, we began to include
industrial chemicals in the Personal Cleansing operating segment
within the Domestic Branded business segment. Prior to the
fourth quarter of 2001, we included discontinued product
activity in the International and Other business segment. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, we began to include discontinued
activity in the business segment that launched the product. The
historical segment information has been restated to reflect the
changes. In December 2002, we announced the pending sale
of our Argentina business and on August28, 2001 we
disposed of our Specialty Personal Care segment. The segment
information has been restated to reflect historical segment
information as adjusted for the reclassification of the
Argentina Business and Specialty Personal Care as discontinued
operations. The Domestic Branded business segment consists of
four aggregated operating segments that manufacture and market
non-durable consumer packaged goods through grocery store, drug
store and mass merchandiser retail outlets. It is comprised of
the Personal Cleansing, Laundry Care, Air Fresheners and Food
Products operating segments. Our subsidiary, ISC International,
Ltd., a manufacturer of translucent soaps, is included in the
Personal Cleansing operating segment. The following table sets

Our International and Other business segment
includes our commercial markets and international businesses.
Our international operations are focused in Canada, Puerto Rico
and exports to Asia and Latin America. During 2002, 2001 and
2000, approximately 82%, 72% and 62%, respectively, of our
international sales came from these markets. In total,
international sales represent 44%, 46% and 51% of sales in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our commercial markets
business sells our products, both branded and nonbranded,
through the commercial channel to hotels, hospitals, schools and
other institutional customers. Information as to our operations in different
business segments is set forth below. The calculation of
operating income for each segment includes an allocation of
certain general and administrative expenses based on each
segments share of consolidated net sales. The accounting
policies of the business segments are the same as those
described in the summary of significant accounting policies

Note20.Litigation
and Claims On May21, 1999, we were served with a
complaint filed by the U.S.Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission the EEOC in the U.S.District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.
This action is entitled Equal Opportunity Commissionv.
The Dial Corporation, Civil Action
No99C3356. The EEOC alleges that Dial engaged
in a pattern and practice of discrimination against a class of
female employees at our Aurora plant by subjecting them to
sexual harassment and failing to take prompt remedial action
after these employees complained about the alleged harassment.
The EEOC is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages. Dial has denied the EEOCs allegations. The
trial is scheduled to begin in late April 2003. During initial
settlement discussions, the EEOC indicated that it is seeking
$15million to resolve this case. Based upon our
investigation, we do not believe the facts warrant such a large
settlement. Accordingly, we are preparing for trial. There currently are 89 potential claimants.
Compensatory and punitive damages are limited to a maximum of
$300,000 for each potential claimant. However, we currently
believe that the number of claimants who ultimately will be
eligible to recover damages, if any, in this case is much fewer
than 89 based upon the potential claimants individualized
allegations and our defenses. Nevertheless, no assurances can be
given regarding the number of potential claimants who will
ultimately be eligible to recover monetary damages. Depending on the outcome, this case could have a
material adverse effect on our operating results in the period
in which the case is resolved. In addition, negative publicity
resulting from this lawsuit could adversely affect our sales and
operating results. 66 Table of Contents THE DIAL CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS Continued As is the case with many companies, we also face
exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving
our business and assets. We are currently party to a number of
lawsuits consisting of ordinary, routine litigation incidental
to our business, including general and product liability and
workers compensation claims. We believe that any
liabilities resulting from these claims, after taking into
account amounts already accrued and exclusive of any potential
insurance recovery, should not have a material adverse effect on
our financial position, cash flows or operating results.
