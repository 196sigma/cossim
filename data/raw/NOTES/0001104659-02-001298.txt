Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data Independent
Auditors Report The Board of Directors
CenterSpan Communications Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
CenterSpan Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31 2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes
in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of CenterSpan
Communications Corporation and subsidiaries as of December31, 2001 and
2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The accompanying notes
are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements. 32 CENTERSPAN COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS NOTE 1. The Company CenterSpan Communications Corporation CenterSpan or the Company
was originally incorporated in 1990 as ThrustMaster, Inc., an Oregon
Corporation. The Company changed its
name to CenterSpan Communications Corporation in October 1999. Until 1999, the Company was a developer and marketer of realistic, high
quality game controllers for the home personal computer PC and video
console markets, which comprised the Companys hardware business. CenterSpan sold this portion of its business
in July 1999. See Note 5. CenterSpan currently develops and markets secure Internet content
delivery solutions for media and communications service providers and the
enterprise. C-Star CDN Services 20 the Companys current offering announced in February 2002, is a suite of
modular content delivery solutions for delivering digital audio, video and data
files. Components of C-Star enable
content preparation, publishing, security, delivery and analytics for media and
entertainment, communications service providers and large corporate customers. The Companys C-Star CDN Services suite is targeted at the Content Distribution
Network CDN market serving communications service providers such as telecom
companies, Multiple Service Operators MSOs and Internet Service Providers
ISPs, and media service providers like movie studios, music labels publishers, distributors and portals.
The Company is also developing product solutions based on C-Star
technology to sell to potential customers such as large corporate customers
that desire to own and operate their own content delivery network. The market for CenterSpans products is characterized by rapidly
changing technology, evolving industry standards, and changing customer
needs. CenterSpan believes that its
future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to enhance its current
products and develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and to
respond to changing customer needs and technological developments. An inability of CenterSpan to generate
demand for its products, whether as a result of competition, technological
change or other factors, could have a material adverse affect on the Companys
financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
CenterSpan Communications Corporation, an Oregon corporation, and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, ThrustMaster Europe Limited, ThrustMaster
Deutschland GmbH and CSCC Corporation.
All inter-company transactions have been eliminated. NOTE 2. Significant
Accounting Policies Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash
equivalents consist of highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less. Restricted Cash. Restricted cash includes $562,000 related to deposits for certain
contracts, a majority of which is scheduled to be paid in May 2002. 33 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. CenterSpans financial instruments consist of accounts payable. For the periods presented, the fair value of
CenterSpans accounts payable is equal to its carrying value. Plant and Equipment. Plant and
equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straightline
method over the estimated useful lives three to seven years. Capital leases are amortized over the life
of the leases. Replacements and
improvements that extend the useful lives are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs and routine
replacements are expensed as incurred.
Upon disposal, costs and related accumulated depreciation of the assets
are removed from the accounts and resulting gains and losses are reflected in
operations. Other Assets. Other assets primarily consist of intangible
assets purchased during 2000 in conjunction with the purchase of certain assets
of Scour, Inc. See Note 4. At December
31, 2001, the intangible assets include a customer list and a trade name, which
are amortized on the straightline basis over the expected period
to be benefited of three years. See
Note 3. Income
Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax
rates is recognized in income in the period of change. The Company has recorded a valuation
allowance for its entire deferred tax asset balance since it is uncertain
whether it will be able to recognize the related tax benefits as a result of
continuing losses. Revenue Recognition. In
December 1999, the Securities Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, which
provides guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles for
revenue recognition in financial statements.
SAB 101 was effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2000 and did
not have a material impact on our financial statements. Revenue is recorded when the following criteria are met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered; the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenue related to advertising has been recognized when services have
been provided. Research and Engineering Expense. CenterSpan follows SFAS No. 2, Accounting
For Research and Development Costs, and charge all research and development
costs to expense as incurred. The cost
of intangibles that are purchased from others for use in research and
development activities and that have alternative future uses are
capitalized. Intangibles purchased for
research that do not have an alternative future use in other research projects
or otherwise are expensed as incurred. 34 Software Development Costs. CenterSpan follows SFAS No. 86, Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed. Costs incurred for the
development of computer software and enhancements to existing software products
that will be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are capitalized when
technological feasibility has been established. Accordingly, development
costs related to software products are expensed until technological feasibility
of the product has been established.
Based on CenterSpans product development process, technological
feasibility is established upon completion of a working model. Costs incurred by CenterSpan between
completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for
general release have not been significant, and, accordingly, no costs have been
capitalized. Advertising. Advertising costs, which include direct advertising, cooperative
advertising and marketing development funds, are expensed as incurred and
totaled $23,000, $462,000 and $159,000 for continuing operations in 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively. Stock
Based Compensation. CenterSpan accounts for stock-based
employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
APB No. 25 and complies with the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if
any, on the date of grant between the exercise price of the instrument granted
and the fair value of the underlying stock. Non-employee
stock-based compensation is determined in accordance with SFAS No. 123 utilizing the Black Scholes valuation methodology. Stock-based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of
the related securities. The Company
accounts for stock and stock options issued to non-employees in accordance with
the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Consensus on Issue No. 96-18 Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. Earnings
Per Share Data. Basic earnings per common share is computed
using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the
period. Diluted earnings per common share
is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the year. Common equivalent shares from stock options
and other common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation when their
effect is antidilutive. Shares used for basic and diluted earnings per share EPS are the
same for all periods presented since CenterSpan was in a loss position. Potentially
dilutive securities that were not included in the diluted net loss per share
calculations because they would be antidilutive were as follows in thousands

35 Comprehensive Income Loss. CenterSpan has adopted the accounting treatment prescribed by
Financial Accounting Standards Board SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive
Income SFAS 130. SFAS 130 establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income loss and its components in financial statements.
Comprehensive income loss, as defined, includes all changes in equity during
a period from non-owner sources. Comprehensive
loss was the same as the net loss for 2001 and 2000 and was $158 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. Use of Estimates. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications, none
of which affected operating or net loss, have been made to the 1999 amounts to
conform to the current presentation. Note 3. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities-an amendment of FASB Statement No.
133 SFAS No. 138. In June 1999 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS No.
137. SFAS No. 137 is an amendment to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFAS Nos. 137 and 138 establish accounting and reporting standards for
all derivative instruments. SFAS Nos.
137 and 138 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. CenterSpan does not currently have any
derivative instruments and, accordingly, the adoption of SFAS Nos. 133, 137 and
138 in the first quarter of 2001 did not have an impact on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and
Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase
method of accounting be used for all business combinations completed after June
30, 2001. SFAS No. 141 also specifies
criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting
that any purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be
accounted for separately. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no
longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable
useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their
estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of. SFAS No. 121
is being superseded by SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets, effective January 1, 2002. 36 The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS
No. 141 July 1, 2001 and will adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 142 on January
1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires, upon
adoption of SFAS No. 142, that the Company evaluate its existing intangible
assets that were acquired in prior purchase business combinations, and make any
necessary reclassifications in order to conform with the new criteria in SFAS
No. 141 for recognition of separately identifiable intangible assets. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company
is required to reassess the useful lives and residual values of all intangible
assets acquired and make any necessary amortization period adjustments by the
end of the first interim period after adoption. In addition, to the extent an intangible asset is identified as
having an indefinite useful life, the Company will be required to test the
intangible asset for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
142 within the first interim period.
Any impairment loss will be measured as of the date of adoption and
recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the
first interim period. At December 31, 2001, the Company did not
have any goodwill, but had unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the
amount of $26 million. The Company anticipates
that it will continue to amortize all of its identifiable intangible
assets. Amortization expense related to
identifiable intangibles was $26 million in 2001 and $0 in both 2000 and 1999. In
2001, the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $31 million
related to its intangible assets. The
Company does not anticipate recording an additional impairment charge in the
first quarter of 2002 upon adoption of SFAS No. 142. In August 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS No. 143, which became effective January 1, 2002. SFAS No. 143 addresses the financial
accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. In October 2001, the FASB approved SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS
No. 144, which supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of SFAS No. 121
and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, Reporting the
Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a
Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions
for the disposal of a segment of a business.
SFAS No. 144 retains many of the fundamental provisions of SFAS No. 121 but resolves certain implementation issues.
SFAS No. 144 will be adopted January 1, 2002. Although we have not completed the evaluation of the affects of
the adoption of SFAS Nos. 143 and 144, we do not believe that the adoption of
SFAS Nos. 143 and 144 will have a material affect on our financial condition or
results of operations. NOTE
4. Purchase of Certain Assets of Scour Inc. In December 2000, the Company purchased certain assets of Scour, Inc.
for $58 million in cash and 333,333 shares of its common stock, which had a
value of $1050 per share, for total consideration of $93 million. The assets consisted of the following in

37 The Company reviews long-lived assets and
identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable as discussed in Note 7. NOTE
5. Discontinued Operations: Disposal of
Hardware Business Assets In October 1999, Guillemot Corporation S.A. Guillemot purchased
certain CenterSpan assets for a total price of $150 million, of which $225
million was retained in escrow and was to be released to CenterSpan pursuant to
a schedule provided in the parties escrow agreement. In June 2000, CenterSpan filed a lawsuit for breach of contract
against Guillemot. CenterSpan alleged
that Guillemot breached the terms of the escrow agreement by prohibiting the
scheduled release of escrow funds to CenterSpan. In March 2001, CenterSpan and
Guillemot entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release under which
CenterSpan received approximately $14 million of restricted cash from escrow.
Guillemot received approximately $10 million from escrow, consisting of
amounts collected on their behalf of approximately $318,000 and downward
purchase price adjustments of approximately $682,000. No amounts remained in escrow at December 31, 2001. The purchase price adjustments made pursuant
to the asset purchase agreement mainly related to uncollected accounts
receivable. In connection with the
release of the restricted cash and final settlement with Guillemot, CenterSpan
recognized a gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2001 of $674,000. The sale of the hardware business has been accounted for as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, its operations are segregated in the
statements of operations. Revenues from
discontinued operations were $135 million for the year ended December 31 1999. Certain expenses have been
allocated to continuing operations, based on the number of employees remaining
with the software business, their related employee costs and overhead for
facilities and other related costs and corporate overhead expenses that were
expected to represent continuing expenses. Loss from discontinued operations was $52 million in 1999. The loss from discontinued operations
represents the net activity of the discontinued hardware business, including
revenues and associated expenses and the resulting tax benefit. NOTE 6. Plant and Equipment Plant and equipment consists of the following at

The Company reviews long-lived assets and
identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. The Company determines impairment based on a comparison of the
carrying amount of the assets to the estimated fair value of the assets, which
is determined based on the discounted cash flow method or current market prices
for similar assets when available.
Based on these analyses, the Company recorded impairment charges
totaling $31 million in 2001 related to the purchased technology and the
customer list. NOTE 8. Accrued Liabilities Accrued liabilities consist of the following at December 31 in

Commitments under capital leases are $225,000 in
2002. Under the agreements for the
lease of its office facilities, CenterSpan is obligated to the lessors for its
share of certain expenses related to the use, operation, maintenance and
insurance of the property. These
expenses, payable monthly in addition to the base rent, are not included in the
amounts shown above. 39 Rental expense totaled $441,000, $222,000 and 222,000 for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Factors That Could
Affect Future Results The revenue and profit potential related to CenterSpans C-Star
technology and C-Star CDN Services and other applications for its C-Star
technology are unproven. These and
other technologies to be developed may not achieve widespread customer
acceptance, which would adversely affect CenterSpans future results of
operations and liquidity. The markets for CenterSpans products and services are characterized by
frequent new product introductions and product obsolescence. These factors typically result in short
product life cycles. If CenterSpan does
not successfully introduce new products within a given product cycle, its sales
will be adversely affected for that cycle and possibly for subsequent
cycles. Failure to timely introduce
these products could also impair CenterSpans brand name and ability to
maintain relationships with strategic partners. In addition, each new product cycle presents new opportunities
for competitors to gain a product advantage or increase their market share. Note
10. Legal Proceedings In May 2001, Ingram Micro, Inc. filed a lawsuit against the Company in
the U.S. District Court for Oregon. The
dispute concerned Ingrams ability to return CenterSpan merchandise for which
it acted as a distributor in 1999. The
amount of the claim was approximately $450,000 plus pre-judgment interest. The Company settled this matter in November
2001 for $225,000. The Company
paid $100,000 on December 1, 2001 and 62,500 on February 1, 2002 and will pay an additional $62,500 on April 1 2002. NOTE 11. Changes in Equity In August 2001, CenterSpan purchased certain assets from

The net change in total valuation allowance for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was an increase of $87 million, $38 million
and $84 million, respectively. The Company has established a valuation allowance for its deferred tax
assets. Such a valuation allowance is
recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The
portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which
subsequently recognized tax benefits will be applied directly to contributed
capital is $38 million as of December 31, 2001. This amount is attributable to differences between financial and
tax reporting of employee stock option transactions. CenterSpan has federal, state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards of $427 million, $507 million and $66 million respectively, and research and experimentation credits of $576,000 that expire
through 2021. CenterSpan also has
Alternative Minimum Tax AMT credits in the amount of $163,000, which may be
carried forward indefinitely. NOTE 14. 401k Plan CenterSpan has a 401k Plan covering
substantially all employees meeting minimum service requirements. The 401k
Plan allows CenterSpan to make discretionary matching contributions. CenterSpan provided discretionary
contributions of $41,000, $36,000, and $30,000 for the years ended December 31 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. 45 NOTE 15. Quarterly

In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company recorded an impairment
charge of $25 million related to the customer list, as discussed in Note 7. NOTE 16. Subsequent Events In February 2002, CenterSpan sold 662,667 units of the Company the
units to a total of twelve accredited investors for $600 per unit for total
proceeds to the Company of $40 million.
Each unit consists of one share of the Companys common stock and a
warrant to purchase one share of the Companys common stock for $1067 per
share. The warrants are immediately
exercisable and expire February 11, 2005.
The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes model using the
following assumptions: expected dividends, 0%; risk-free interest rate, 36 volatility, 927%; and contractual life, 3 years. The relative fair value of the warrants was $15 million. In February 2002, CenterSpan entered into an agreement with Sony Music
wherein Sony will provide CenterSpan with certain musical content for it to
distribute digitally via its C-Star content delivery network to various
C-Star service provider customers and their subscribers in the U.S. and Canada. In exchange, CenterSpan issued to Sony
283,556 shares of its common stock and a warrant to purchase 189,037 shares of
its common stock. In addition CenterSpan agreed to pay an initial content integration fee of $500,000 in
connection with execution of the agreement and an additional content
integration fee of $500,000 on September 1, 2002, as well as quarterly advance
minimum service fees of $250,000 for four quarters beginning September 1, 2002. The 283,556 shares of common stock issued to Sony had a value of $17
million, representing an approximately 25% discount from the trailing 10-day
volume-weighted average price of the Companys common stock. The warrant to purchase 189,037 shares of
CenterSpans common stock has an exercise price of $811 per share and was
valued using the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: expected
dividends, 0%; risk-free interest rate, 36%; volatility, 927%; and
contractual life, 3 years. The fair
value of the warrant was $10 million. 46 In March 2002, CenterSpan entered into an agreement with an investor
who unconditionally agreed to purchase up to 833,333 shares of CenterSpans
common stock at a price of $600 per share, if requested to do so by the
company, in one or more private transactions representing total maximum
proceeds to the Company of $50 million.
As compensation for entering into this commitment, the Company issued to
the investor a three-year warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of CenterSpans
common stock at $1067 per share. To
the extent the investor purchases more than 100,000 shares of CenterSpans
common stock under this commitment, he will also receive a three-year warrant
to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock at $1067 per share. CenterSpan has also arranged a stand by line of credit in the amount of 10 million on which the Company can draw after July 2002. In March 2002, CenterSpan sold 333,333 units of the Company the
units to a total of six accredited investors for $600 per unit for total
proceeds to the Company of $20 million.
Each unit consists of one share of the Companys common stock and a
warrant to purchase one share of the Companys common stock for $1067 per
share. The warrants are immediately
exercisable and expire March 29, 2005.
The warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes model using the
following assumptions: expected dividends, 0%; risk-free interest rate, 36 volatility, 927%; and contractual life, 3 years. The relative fair value of the warrants was $800,000. Item 1.
