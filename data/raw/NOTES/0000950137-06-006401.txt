Notes to Consolidated Financial    48     Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting as defined in the Securities Exchange Act Rule
13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer,
we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of March 31, 2006. In making this assessment, our management used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework.
In conducting our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting, we have excluded the following acquisitions completed
during fiscal year 2006: Jon-Jay Associates, Inc., Glick & Glick Consultants,
LLC, Employers Unity, Inc. and Business Incentives, Inc., doing business as
Management Insights, Inc. Total revenues of these entities for the periods from
the respective acquisitions through March 31, 2006 were $19,000,000. These
entities were acquired for total consideration of $83,000,000, subject to
certain contingent purchase price adjustments. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these acquisitions
and their impact on our consolidated financial results.
Our management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2006, our internal control
over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria. Our independent
registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on our
assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included
on page 43 herein.

41       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TALX Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TALX Corporation
and subsidiaries the Company as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
March 31, 2006. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2006, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our
report dated May 31, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on management
assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting. s/ KPMG LLP

42       Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of TALX Corporation We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that TALX
Corporation and subsidiaries the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Company management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control -- Integrated Framework issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.
The Company acquired Jon-Jay Associates, Inc., Glick & Glick Consultants, LLC,
Employers Unity, Inc. and Business Incentives, Inc., doing business as
Management Insights, Inc., during the year ended March 31, 2006. Management
excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2006, these entities' internal
control over financial reporting associated with total revenues of $19,000,000,
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the periods
from the respective acquisitions through March 31, 2006. These entities were
acquired for total consideration of $83,000,000, subject to certain contingent
purchase price adjustments. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control
over financial reporting of these entities.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company as of March 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March 31, 2006, and
our report dated May 31, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2005 AND 2006
1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a Description of Business
We are a leading provider of payroll-related and human resources business
process outsourcing services. Our services enable our clients to automate and
outsource the performance of payroll and human resources business processes that
would otherwise be performed by their own in-house payroll or human resources
departments. Our clients are large and mid-size organizations, including more
than three-fourths of the Fortune 500 companies in a wide variety of industries,
as well as a number of government agencies. Our current services include
employment and income verification and other payroll-related services,
unemployment tax management services, tax credit and incentive services, and
employee assessment and talent management services. Our services are enabled by
our proprietary databases and applications that are designed to quickly and
efficiently access and process large volumes of data. We employ web, interactive
voice response, fax, document imaging and other technologies to enhance the
services offered to our clients. We can interact with various payroll and human
resources systems, but are virtually independent of the information technology
services our clients select.
b Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TALX Corporation
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.
c Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.
d Short-term Investments
Short-term investments at March 31, 2006 consist of highly liquid money market
account deposits. We classify our short-term investments in one of two
categories: available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities
are those securities which we have the ability and intent to hold until
maturity. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale. All of our
securities were classified as available-for-sale at March 31, 2006. Interest
income is recognized when earned. Short-term investments classified as
available-for-sale are stated at market value.
e Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of
factors. In cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific
customer ability to meet its financial obligations, we record a specific
allowance against amounts due, and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable
i.e., net of deferred revenue to the amount we reasonably believe will be
collected. For the remaining customers, we recognize allowances for doubtful
accounts based on the length of time the aggregate receivables are outstanding,
the current business environment and historical experience.
f Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. We depreciate property and equipment evenly over the assets'
estimated useful lives. We amortize leasehold improvements evenly over the
lesser of the useful life of the asset or lease term.
g Product Development and Capitalized Software Development Costs
Software development costs are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility is achieved, after which time they are capitalized on a
product-by-product basis. We amortize capitalized software development costs
evenly over the remaining estimated economic life of the product, generally
three to five years. We begin amortization of capitalized software
48 development costs when the product is available for general release to clients.
We review all capitalized software assets for impairment as of each balance
sheet date. Upon determination of any impairment, we write the asset down to the
appropriate value in the period that the impairment is determined.
h Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
We have adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business
Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of
April 1, 2002. SFAS No. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be
used for all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no
longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. In
accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is reviewed for impairment based upon
reporting units.
i Revenue Recognition, Unbilled Receivables and Deferred Revenue
All revenues are generally recognized pursuant to annual or multi-year
contracts.
Revenues from The Work Number are realized primarily from transaction or monthly
fees and, to a lesser degree, based on up-front set-up fees and periodic
maintenance fees. Revenues for transaction fees are recognized in the period
that they are earned, based on fees charged to users at the time they conduct
verifications of employment and income. In accordance with Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 104, the revenue for set-up fees and monthly maintenance fees is
recognized on a straight-line basis from the time the service is available to be
used by our clients through the end of the service period.
Revenue for our W-2 service is recognized evenly from the time the service is
available for use by TALX clients through the end of the service period.
Additionally, we have some clients that are billed for this service on a
transactional basis. For these clients, we recognize revenue on a monthly basis,
as transactions occur.
We charge ePayroll clients on a per-employee, per-month basis, plus an initial
set-up fee. Revenue for the initial set-up fees is recognized evenly over the
initial contract period, beginning with the date the client is live on our
system. Per-employee, per-month fees are recognized as revenue in the period the
service is provided.
FasTime clients are billed for initial set-up fees, monthly maintenance fees and
per transaction fees. Revenue is recognized evenly from the time the service is
available for use by our clients through the end of the service period for
set-up and maintenance fees and as services are performed for transaction-based
fees.
HireXpress clients are billed for initial set-up fees and per transaction fees
or monthly fees. Revenue is recognized evenly from the time the service is
available for use by our clients through the end of the service period for
set-up fees and as services are performed for transaction-based or monthly fees.
Revenues from our unemployment tax management services are recognized in the
period that they are earned, evenly over the life of the contract. Transaction
fees are recorded as the services are provided. Unemployment tax management
revenue that is contingent upon achieving certain performance criteria is
recognized when those criteria are met.
We realize revenues in our tax credits and incentives business on a contingent
basis, as a percentage of the tax credits and incentives delivered to our
clients. Revenues related to WOTC and WtW tax credits are recognized after the
applicable state government has certified the eligibility of the client
employee and the employee has worked the required number of hours to receive the
credit. Revenue related to state and local tax credits and certain other federal
tax credits is recognized based on milestones achieved, calculation of the
underlying credit, or the client utilization of the underlying credit,
depending upon the provisions of the contract.
In relationships with certain of our customers, we enter into agreements with
more than one of our service offerings included in the arrangement. When a
client contracts with us to provide more than one service, the terms of the
underlying contract itemize each service provided and the related fees for each
service. In accordance with the consensus of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 00-21, as these fee arrangements are similar to those charged to other
clients, we recognize revenue on the basis of the fair values of the underlying
services.
49 Deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of The Work Number set-up fees,
unemployment tax management and maintenance fees.
Commissions paid are deferred and charged to expense proportionally over the
related service period.
Direct expenses related to cost of revenues are tracked separately for each
service we provide. Incremental direct costs that are related to the origination
of a client contract are expensed as incurred.
j Concentration of Credit Risk
We sell our services and software in a variety of industries. No client
represented over 10% of revenues in fiscal 2004, 2005 or 2006. We perform
periodic credit evaluations of our clients' financial conditions and do not
require collateral. Credit losses from clients have been within our
expectations, and we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately
provides for any expected losses.
k Income Taxes
We record income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred taxes
arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and
tax accounting, known as temporary differences. We record the tax effect of
these temporary differences as deferred tax assets generally items that can be
used as a tax deduction or credit in future periods and deferred tax
liabilities generally items that we received a tax deduction for, but have not
yet been recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.
l Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We disclose estimated fair values for our financial instruments. A financial
instrument is defined as cash or a contract that both imposes on one entity a
contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial instrument to a
second entity and conveys to that second entity a contractual right to receive
cash or another financial instrument from the first entity. Our financial
instruments include our credit facility. The carrying value of this credit
facility approximates fair value as its stated interest rate approximates market
rates. Estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market
information or other appropriate valuation methodologies.
m Derivative Financial Instruments
Our policy is to manage interest costs using a mix of fixed and variable rate
debt. Using interest rate swap agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified
intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated
by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We do not hold or
issue any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
n Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, as permitted by
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
We record compensation expense related to restricted stock awards over the
vesting periods of the awards and reflect the unearned portion of deferred
compensation as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Since all of our options are granted with an option price equal to the market
price at the time of grant, we have not recognized any stock-based employee
compensation cost under our stock option plans. SFAS No. 123 requires pro forma
disclosure of the impact on earnings as if the compensation expense for these
plans had been determined using the fair value method.
50 Compensation cost is calculated under a straight line basis. The following table
presents our net earnings and earnings per share as reported and the pro forma
amounts that would have been reported using the fair value method under SFAS No.

Net earnings, pro forma..   $   035   $   047   $ 085
The fair value of option grants for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006 is estimated on
the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
following weighted-average assumptions: expected volatility of 70%, 48%, and 50%
in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively; risk-free interest rate of 300 407%, and 390% in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively; expected life of
70, 70, and 60 years in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively; and an
expected dividend yield of 090%, 078%, and 063% in fiscal 2004, 2005 and
2006, respectively.
In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123r, Share-Based Payments
SFAS No. 123r, a revision of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS No. 123, which requires companies to measure all employee
stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such
expense in their consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS No.
123r are effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after June
15, 2005. We have adopted this standard effective April 1, 2006 and elected the
modified-prospective transition method. Under the modified-prospective
transition method, awards that are granted, modified, repurchased or canceled
after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance
with SFAS No. 123r. Stock-based awards that are granted prior to the effective
date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123, except
that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the
statement of operations.
o Management Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those
estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for depreciation, amortization,
allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes as well as in the evaluation of
potential losses due to impairment or pending litigation.
p Litigation
When a contingency becomes probable and estimable a reserve is established in
the consolidated financial statements. To the extent not recoverable by
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage, legal costs are expensed
as incurred.
q Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all
51 employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on
earnings per share and the dilutive effect of all restricted stock. The weighted
average number of shares is based on common stock outstanding for basic earnings
per share and common stock outstanding, restricted stock outstanding, and common
stock options and warrants for diluted earnings per share in periods when such
common stock options and warrants are not antidilutive.

5 ACQUISITIONS
Pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated April 20, 2005, we acquired Jon-Jay
Associates, Inc., which specializes in providing unemployment cost management
services as well as an employment verification service, for approximately $24
million, including transaction costs, subject to certain post-closing
adjustments. Additionally, the acquisition agreement includes provisions for
potential earn-out payments if certain future financial performance measures are
achieved through the twelve months ending April 30, 2006 and April 30, 2007,
respectively.
Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated April 26, 2005, we acquired
substantially all of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Glick
& Glick Consultants, LLC, which specializes in employment-related tax credit and
incentive services, for approximately $5 million, including transaction costs,
subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated November 1, 2005, we acquired the
unemployment tax management businesses of Employers Unity, Inc., for
approximately $30 million, including transaction costs, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments.
Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated December 15, 2005, we acquired the
tax credit and incentives business of Business Incentives, Inc., doing business
as Management Insights, Inc., for approximately $24 million, including
transaction costs, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, there are additional contingent
payments to be calculated based on identified performance criteria as specified
in the underlying purchase agreements. When determined beyond a reasonable
doubt, these additional payments will be recorded as goodwill. In fiscal year
2006, approximately $5 million in contingent payments have been made. We
estimate that additional payments could range up to approximately $14 million
and be payable over the next 18 months.
The following table summarizes the purchase price allocations of the estimated
fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquired
businesses as of the effective dates of the acquisitions. The purchase price
allocations for Employers Unity, Inc. and Management Insights, Inc. are
preliminary, and final determinations of the required purchase accounting
adjustments will be made upon the completion of our integration plans.                   JON-JAY ASSOCIATES,     GLICK & GLICK     EMPLOYERS UNITY,       MANAGEMENT

6 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
In connection with the acquisitions of Ti3, Inc.; the unemployment cost
management services business of Gates, McDonald & Company, a subsidiary of
Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company; James E. Frick, Inc., d/b/a The Frick
Company; Johnson and Associates; the Sheakley Businesses; TBT Enterprises,
Incorporated and UI Advantage, Inc.; Net Profit, Inc., Jon-Jay Associates, Inc.,
the tax credits and incentives business of Glick & Glick Consultants LLC, the
unemployment tax management business of Employers Unity, Inc., and the tax
credits and incentives business of Business Incentives, Inc., doing business as
Management Insights, Inc., we acquired certain identifiable intangible assets.
These acquisitions enhance our existing service offerings by allowing us to
offer clients expanded services in connection with electronic time reporting,
the processing of unemployment claims, and the processing of the federal work
opportunity WOTC and welfare to work WTW tax credits, as well as
assisting clients in calculating certain other federal and state tax credits. We
recorded these assets in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards
Board SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations.
Effective April 1, 2002, we adopted the SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 addresses the initial recognition and
measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and
the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their
acquisition. SFAS No. 142 provides that intangible assets with finite useful
lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
will not be amortized, but will rather be tested at least annually for
impairment. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, any impairment loss identified
upon adoption of this standard is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle. We reviewed our goodwill and intangible assets as of
December 31, 2004 and 2005 and determined that no impairment existed.

On April 14, 2005, we entered into a secured second amended and restated loan
agreement the 2005 Loan Agreement with LaSalle Bank National Association, as
administrative agent and the lenders party thereto collectively, the
Lenders, to replace the loan agreement in place at the time, which we refer
to as the 2004 Loan Agreement, and refinance in full the $575 million
outstanding loan balance at March 31, 2005. The 2005 Loan Agreement established
a $1000 million revolving line of credit and provided for the issuance of
letters of credit and swingline loans. On November 1, 2005, we amended the 2005
Loan Agreement to expand the availability under our revolving line of credit to
$1500 million, of which $392 million remained available as of March 31, 2006.
The proceeds of loans made under the 2005 Loan Agreement may be used solely to
refinance loans outstanding under the 2004 Loan Agreement and for working
capital, permitted capital expenditures, as the source for payment of our
obligations with respect to letters of credit, to pay the transaction costs of
the 2005 Loan Agreement, to finance permitted acquisitions meeting specified
criteria, and to finance certain repurchases of our capital stock subject to
specified limitations. The 2005 Loan Agreement is secured by pledges of our
stock and membership interests in, and guarantees of, our material subsidiaries
and security interests in substantially all of our assets.
Loans under the 2005 Loan Agreement mature on April 14, 2010, except that any
letters of credit may extend beyond that date if the letter of credit lender
approves and we provide sufficient collateral as security for an extended loan.
We may make prepayments on advances under the revolving credit facility without
penalty, provided we give at least one business day notice, pay accrued
interest and otherwise make the applicable lenders whole. As the Loan Agreement
is a 5-year revolving credit facility, there are no scheduled minimum principal
repayments in fiscal years 2006 through 2010. All amounts outstanding under the
credit facility are due and payable on April 14, 2010.
Advances under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates we select,
including a base rate or the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The base rate
is a variable rate equal to the greater of the Lender prime rate or the
federal funds rate plus 05%. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans will
vary from 125% to 200%. Swingline loans will bear interest at the base rate.
During the existence of an event of default, loans will bear additional interest
of 200% per year.
We paid the Lenders an amendment fee equal to $50,000 on the effective date of
the 2005 Loan Agreement and an amendment fee equal to $75,000 on November 1,
2005 in connection with the first amendment. We also will pay a facility fee,
payable on a quarterly basis in the amount equal to 025% of the unused portion
of the revolving credit facility. If we utilize any letters of credit, we will
pay a fronting fee equal to 0125% of the face amount of each letter of credit,
as well as a letter of credit fee equal to the aggregate undrawn amount of the
letter of credit multiplied by the LIBOR margin in effect on the date the letter
of credit is issued.
The 2005 Loan Agreement includes certain covenants, including, without
limitation, restrictions on the use of proceeds of any loans, as described
above. The 2005 Loan Agreement also requires compliance with certain financial
covenants based on our minimum interest coverage the ratio of EBIT minus
dividends and income tax expense to interest expense, minimum EBITDA as
defined in the 2005 Loan Agreement and as adjusted for, among other things,
approved acquisitions and the SEC settlement charge, as discussed in Note 1 and
our ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA as so adjusted. The 2005 Loan
Agreement also requires compliance with certain operating and other covenants
which limit, without first obtaining written consent of the lenders, among other
things, the ability of TALX and our subsidiaries to incur additional debt with
specified exceptions, sales of assets, changes in our capital structure,
affiliated transactions, acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders.
The 2005 Loan Agreement generally prohibits the payment of cash dividends,
except for cash dividends not in excess of six cents per share per calendar
quarter, up to a maximum of $75 million per fiscal year so long as we are not
in default at the time of the declaration. The 2005 Loan Agreement also contains
various representations and warranties, regarding, among others, compliance with
material laws, the accuracy of financial statements and other information
delivered to the Lenders and the absence of material changes.
In the event of a default under the 2005 Loan Agreement, the Lenders may
terminate the commitments made under the Loan Agreement, declare amounts
outstanding, including accrued interest and fees, payable immediately, and
enforce any and all rights and interests.
56 9 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT
We have entered into an interest rate swap contract which has a notional amount
of $140 million at March 31, 2006. Under this contract, we pay a fixed rate of
372% and receive a variable rate of LIBOR, which is equal to the LIBOR rate
utilized on our outstanding revolving loans. The notional amount of our interest
rate swap contract steps down over time until its termination on March 31, 2008.
Effective April 14, 2005, in connection with the refinancing of our credit
facility existing at that time, we matched our existing interest rate swap to
our outstanding borrowings. This strategy effectively converts a portion of our
outstanding revolving loans into a fixed rate instrument over the term of the
interest rate swap contract.
The interest rate swap and related gains and losses arising on the contract are
accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Specifically, changes in the
fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are deferred
and recorded in other comprehensive income. These deferred gains or losses are
recognized in income when the transactions being hedged are completed.
We do not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
10 LEASES
We have non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for office space and office
equipment, that expire through fiscal 2013. Total rent expense for operating
leases was $53 million, $60 million, and $73 million in 2004, 2005 and 2006,
respectively.
Amortization expense associated with assets acquired under capital leases is
included in total depreciation and amortization expense.

An income tax benefit totaling approximately $614,000 was charged directly to
shareholders' equity in fiscal year 2005 in connection with the exercise of
stock options. In fiscal year 2006, the following approximate income tax
benefits were charged directly to shareholders' equity: $31 million in
connection with the exercise and/or disqualifying disposition of stock options 44,000 in connection with disqualifying dispositions under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan; $40,000 in connection with restricted stock awards; and $963,000
in connection with the exercise of warrants by a third party service provider.
Deferred tax liabilities of approximately $11 million in fiscal year 2005 and
$33 million in fiscal year 2006 were set up related to stock acquisitions for
differences in the assigned values and the tax bases of acquired assets and
liabilities other than the portion of goodwill for which amortization is not
deductible for tax purposes. This deferred tax liability is part of the
purchase accounting for the stock acquisitions, and was charged directly to
goodwill.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those
temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable
income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the
deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not we
will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
TALX operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in
those jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service for the tax year ended March 31, 2004. We have not received any
assessments from the Internal Revenue Service related to this audit at this
time, and do not expect the results of this examination to have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
58 12 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
On January 6, 2005, we declared a 3-for-2 stock split, which was effected in the
form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable February 17, 2005, to shareholders
of record on January 20, 2005. On November 14, 2005, we declared a 3-for-2 stock
split, which was effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable
January 17, 2006 to shareholders of record on December 19, 2005. Earnings per
share and weighted average number of common shares outstanding throughout these
financial statements have been retroactively adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock
splits.
TALX has adopted the 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan that provides for the issuance
of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock
grants, stock appreciation rights and performance units. The plan allows for
maximum awards of 4,500,000 shares of common stock, after adjustment for the
3-for-2 stock split. On September 25, 2005, the Board of Directors awarded
55,200 shares of restricted stock under the plan to employees and 15,000 shares
of restricted stock to our outside Directors, after adjustment for the effect of
the 3-for-2 stock split. The weighted average fair value of the restricted
shares on the date of grant was $2239, after adjustment for the 3-for-2 stock
split. On January 24, 2006, the Board of Directors awarded 97,250 shares of
restricted stock under the plan to employees and 15,000 shares of restricted
stock to our outside Directors, after adjustment for the effect of the 3-for-2
stock split. The weighted average fair value of the restricted shares on the
date of grant was $3292. The shares awarded to employees and outside Directors
vest evenly over five and three years, respectively. Recipients of restricted
stock pay $001 cash consideration per share, have the right to vote all shares
subject to the grant, and have dividend rights with respect to the shares,
whether or not the shares have vested.
TALX had previously adopted a stock option plan for employees that provided for
the issuance of a maximum of 6,860,700 shares of common stock, after adjustment
for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock splits, pursuant to incentive or
non-qualified options. Options were granted by the Board of Directors at prices
not less than fair market value as of the date of the grant. Options vested 20%
per year and expired six to ten years after the date of the grant. In fiscal
year 2006, the Board granted 11,250 options under this plan, after adjustment
for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split. Upon adoption of the 2005 Omnibus
Incentive Plan, we can make no further awards under the previous stock option
plan.
TALX had also previously adopted a stock option plan for outside Directors that
provided for the issuance of a maximum of 326,700 shares of common stock, after
adjustment for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock splits. On May 10, 2005, the
outside Directors were awarded options in the amount of 2,812 shares each, after
adjustment for the 3-for-2 stock split, at the fair market value as of the date
of the grant. The options vest one year from the date of grant. Options
outstanding amount to 122,379 and 111,933 at March 31, 2005 and 2006,
respectively, after adjustment for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock splits.
The stock option plan for outside Directors also provided for grants of
restricted stock of a total of not more than 12,000 restricted shares per year
to the outside Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors. Under this plan, a total of 22,500 shares of
restricted shares were awarded to our outside Directors in fiscal 2005, after
adjustment for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock splits. The restricted shares
vest evenly over 3 years. The weighted average fair value of the restricted
shares on the date of grant was $1149, after adjustment for the effect of the
3-for-2 stock splits. Recipients of restricted stock pay $001 cash
consideration per share, have the right to vote all shares subject to the grant,
and have dividend rights with respect to the shares, whether or not the shares
have vested. Upon adoption of the omnibus incentive plan, we could make no
further awards under the previous stock option plan.

issued them warrants to purchase a total of 68,062 shares of our common stock at
an exercise price of $321 per share, after adjustment for the effect of the
2005 3-for-2 stock split. All 68,062 warrants were exercised in fiscal year
2006, prior to the record date of the 2006 3-for-2 stock split.
During fiscal 1997, shareholders approved the TALX Corporation 1996 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, which was amended in 1998 and 2000 and amended and
restated in 2001. The ESPP allows eligible employees the right to purchase
common stock on a quarterly basis at the lower of 85% of the market price at the
beginning or end of each three-month offering period. Of the 2,041,875 shares of
common stock shares reserved for the ESPP, after adjustment for the effect of
the 3-for-2 stock splits, there were 613,594 shares remaining at March 31, 2006.
On May 10, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to three
million shares of our stock, after adjustment for the 3-for-2 stock split, in
the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions during the
36-month period ending May 9, 2008, subject to market conditions and other
factors. Under this plan, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 56,700
shares of our common stock, as adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split. All shares
repurchased have been reissued in connection with restricted stock grants.
During fiscal 2001, we began paying dividends on our common stock on a quarterly
basis. After adjustment for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock splits, dividends of
$009, $011 and $013 per share were declared and dividends of $008, $010 and
$012 per share were paid to shareholders during fiscal years 2004, 2005 and
2006, respectively. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings, capital
requirements, operating and financial condition, restrictions in our Loan
Agreement, and such other factors as the board may deem relevant.
60 13 EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
incremental increase in common shares outstanding assuming the exercise of all
employee stock options and warrants that would have had a dilutive effect on
earnings per share and the dilutive effect of all restricted stock. The weighted
average number of shares is based on common stock outstanding for basic earnings
per share and common stock outstanding, restricted stock outstanding, and common
stock options and warrants for diluted earnings per share in periods when such
common stock options and warrants are not antidilutive. As of March 31, 2005 and
2006, stock options to purchase 272,679 and 0 shares, respectively, were not
dilutive and, therefore, were not included in the computations of diluted
earnings per share amounts.
On January 6, 2005, we declared a 3-for-2 stock split, which was effected in the
form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable February 17, 2005, to shareholders
of record January 20, 2005. On November 14, 2005, we declared a 3-for-2 stock
split, which was effected in the form of a 50 percent stock dividend, payable
January 17, 2006 to shareholders of record on December 19, 2005. Earnings per
share and weighted average number of common shares outstanding throughout this
Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively adjusted for the 3-for-2
stock splits.                                    YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,

61 14 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On April 21, 2003, the Board of Directors granted management the authority to
dispose of the Human Resources and Benefits Application Services business.
Accordingly, it was determined that this business met the requirements to be
presented as a discontinued operation.
On April 22, 2003 we transferred substantially all of the assets of our Human
Resources and Benefits Application Services business to Workscape, Inc., a
Massachusetts-based provider of benefits and workforce management solutions. The
primary product of this line of services, the benefits enrollment business,
provides a customized solution for clients' employees to enroll in an employer
benefits programs and make changes to their personal information and benefits
elections, all by means of the Internet or by telephone. Workscape, Inc. hired
all of the employees directly related to the benefits enrollment business.
The transaction was structured as a transfer of assets under contract for sale
with no initial down-payment and the purchase price to be paid over a three-year
period, based on a client retention formula. Proceeds were anticipated to be
between $20 million and $60 million. While the contract did not specify a
minimum guaranteed amount, we secured a $20 million note from Workscape, Inc.
As of March 31, 2006, we had received payment in full on the note, $135,000 of
interest payments in connection with the note, and $793,000 in additional
consideration.
All assets and liabilities of this business, both the portion of the business
transferred under contract to Workscape, Inc. approximately 90% of the assets
and the remaining approximately 10% of assets that were transferred to another
third party, along with related transaction costs, were recorded on our
consolidated balance sheet as net assets of business held for sale. We recorded
cash received under the asset purchase agreement first to reduce the recorded
value of net assets of business held for sale and then to reflect gain on the
sale of the business.
In connection with the transfer, we provided Workscape, Inc., for agreed-upon
fees, with various transition services related to the operation of the benefits
enrollment business through December 2005. These fees, offset by costs to
deliver the service, were recorded first to reduce the recorded value of net
assets of business held for sale and then to reflect gain on the sale of the
business. As of December 31, 2005, we are no longer providing transition
services related to this business.
The historical results of operations for this business have been reclassified to
earnings from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of earnings.
The results of operations for this business for the years ended March 31, 2004,
2005 and 2006 were as follows                             MARCH 31,

15 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN
We sponsor a profit-sharing/401k plan. The plan covers substantially all of
our employees. Employees may contribute up to 50% of pre-tax compensation to the
plan. We make contributions to the plan, subject to ERISA limitations, up to
24% of employees' earnings. There is a three-year graded vesting schedule for
employer matching contributions. Participants direct the investment of both
employee deferral and employer matching contributions among a variety of
investment choices. The plan does not hold company stock. Total expense under
the plan for the years ended March 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006 was $831,000, $10
million, and $12 million, respectively.
62 16 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits. Based on information currently
available, we believe that no current proceedings, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon us. On March 3, 2005, we
agreed with the SEC, without admitting of denying any liability, to pay one
dollar in disgorgement and, pursuant to a court order, to pay a $25 million
civil penalty, and not to violate certain provisions of the federal securities
laws in the future.
17 BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
As a result of recent acquisitions, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, we
determined that we operate in four business segments. The presentation of
segment information reflects the manner in which management organizes segments
for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company Chief
Operating Decision Maker and Board of Directors review gross profit for the
Company business units. The Company Chief Operating Decision Maker and Board
of Directors only review profit and loss information after gross profit on a
consolidated basis to assess performance, make overall operating decisions and
make resource allocations. The Company business units are closely interrelated
in their activities and share services such as order entry, billing, technical
services, network facilities, telecommunications, purchasing and information
technology facilities. As a result, it is impractical and provides no value to
allocate costs of all of these services to the business units or to allocate any
of the underlying assets to the businesses. Additionally, the Company Chief
Operating Decision Maker and its principal officers participate in a cash bonus
program which rewards performance based upon consolidated Company results.
As of March 31, 2006, the Company operations are conducted principally through
business segments comprised of: The Work Number services, unemployment tax
management, tax credits and incentives, and maintenance and support. The Work
Number services include our employment and income verification services, W-2
management services which include initial distribution, reissue and correction
of W-2 forms, paperless pay services that enable employees to electronically
receive pay statement information as well as review and change direct deposit
account or W-4 information, integrated electronic time capture and reporting
services, paperless new-hire services to bring new workers on board using
electronic forms, and I-9 management services designed to help clients
electronically comply with the immigration laws that requires employers to
complete an I-9 form for each new hire. Our unemployment tax management segment
includes our unemployment and claims management and unemployment tax planning
services. Tax credits and incentives includes the identification, calculation,
and processing of certain federal, state and local tax credits for our clients.
Our fourth segment, maintenance and support, relates to a business the Company
is phasing out. There are no intersegment sales, and we do not allocate assets
to the segments.
Prior period information has been reclassified to reflect the establishment of
the unemployment tax management segment and the tax credits and incentives
segment, which were previously presented together as one segment.

19 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION
James W. Canfield, the son of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed in a non-executive position with our Company as Director of
Product Management. Mr. Canfield has a current annual salary of $125,000 and is
eligible for a bonus of approximately $46,000 based upon certain performance
goals. This bonus can decrease or increase based on the percentage achievement
of these performance goals. Mr. Canfield is also eligible annually for an award
of restricted stock. Both the bonus and restricted stock awards are granted
under standard corporate compensation plans and are consistent with payments
made to director-level managers at Mr. Canfield level. For fiscal 2006, Mr.
Canfield received $115,600 in salary, approximately $42,000 in bonus and 1,700
shares of restricted stock for his services to the Company.
20 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
ACQUISITION
Pursuant to an acquisition agreement dated April 6, 2006, we acquired
Performance Assessment Network, Inc., a provider of secure, electronic-based
psychometric testing and assessments, as well as comprehensive talent management
services, for approximately $75 million, including transaction costs, subject to
certain post-closing adjustments. The purchase price was determined based on
arms'-length negotiations, and was paid in cash financed through our 2005 Loan
Agreement as discussed above in Note 8.
64
The acquisition agreement provides for indemnification of the Company by the
sellers for certain pre-closing liabilities and obligations of the business,
subject to certain limitations. An escrow account, maintained pursuant to the
terms of the escrow agreement, is also available until eighteen months following
the purchase to satisfy the indemnification obligations under the purchase
agreement, subject to certain limitations described in the acquisition
agreement. Of the purchase price, $100 million was paid into the escrow
account.
AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT
On April 6, 2006, we entered into the second amendment to the 2005 Loan
Agreement which expanded the availability under our revolving line of credit to
$200 million and provided for mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions
under certain circumstances, as well as an accordion feature that permits
restoration of the $200 million availability under certain circumstances. There
are procedures, including limitations on the timing and increments, associated
with such a commitment increase request. The second amendment also revised and
updated other terms, including the terms of some of the financial covenants
under the Loan Agreement.
On May 25, 2006, concurrently with the issuance and sale of the $750 principal
amount of Senior Guaranteed Notes due May 25, 2014, which we refer to as the
Notes, we entered into a $1500 million third amended and restated loan
agreement, which we refer to as the 2006 Loan Agreement, with the Lenders to
replace the 2005 Loan Agreement and refinance in full the $1124 million
outstanding loan balance on May 25, 2006, after giving effect to the repayment
of $742 million of loans from the proceeds of the Notes. The 2006 Loan
Agreement established a $1500 million revolving line of credit and provided for
the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans. The 2006 Loan Agreement
includes an accordion feature that permits us to increase availability to $200
million under certain circumstances. There are procedures, including limitations
on the timing and increments, associated with such a commitment increase
request. In conjunction with the 2006 Loan Agreement, the Lenders released their
security interests in our and our subsidiaries' assets and the stock of our
subsidiaries, which had existed under the 2005 Loan Agreement.
The proceeds of loans made under the 2006 Loan Agreement may be used solely to
refinance loans outstanding under the 2005 Loan Agreement and for working
capital, permitted capital expenditures, as the source for payment of our
obligations with respect to letters of credit, to pay the transaction costs of
the 2006 Loan Agreement, to finance permitted acquisitions meeting specified
criteria, and to finance certain repurchases of our capital stock subject to
specified limitations. The 2006 Loan Agreement is absolutely and unconditionally
guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
We may make prepayments on advances under the revolving credit facility without
penalty, provided we give at least one business day notice, pay accrued
interest and otherwise make the applicable lenders whole. As the 2006 Loan
Agreement is a revolving credit facility, there are no scheduled minimum
principal repayments in fiscal years 2006 through 2010. All amounts outstanding
under the credit facility are due and payable on April 14, 2010.
Advances under the revolving credit facility bear interest at rates we select,
including a base rate or the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The base rate
is a variable rate equal to the greater of the Lender prime rate or the
federal funds rate plus 05%. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans will
vary from 100% to 175%. Swingline loans will bear interest at the base rate.
During the existence of an event of default, loans will bear additional interest
of 200% per year.
We will pay a facility fee, payable on a quarterly basis in the amount equal to
025% of the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. If we utilize any
letters of credit, we will pay a fronting fee equal to 0125% of the face amount
of each letter of credit, as well as a letter of credit fee equal to the
aggregate undrawn amount of the letter of credit multiplied by the LIBOR margin
in effect on the date the letter of credit is issued. In connection with the
second amendment to the 2005 Loan Agreement, we paid the Lenders amendment fees
in the aggregate amount of $55,000 on the effective date.
65 The 2006 Loan Agreement includes certain covenants, including, without
limitation, restrictions on the use of proceeds of any loans, as described
above. The 2006 Loan Agreement also requires compliance with certain financial
covenants based on our minimum interest coverage the ratio of EBIT minus
dividends and income tax expense to interest expense, minimum EBITDA as
defined in the 2006 Loan Agreement and as adjusted for, among other things,
approved acquisitions and our ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA as so
adjusted. The 2006 Loan Agreement also requires compliance with certain
operating and other covenants which limit, without first obtaining written
consent of the lenders, among other things, the ability of TALX and our
subsidiaries to incur additional debt with specified exceptions, sales of
assets, changes in our capital structure, affiliate transactions, acquisitions,
and distributions to our shareholders. The 2006 Loan Agreement generally
prohibits the payment of cash dividends, except for cash dividends not in excess
of six cents per share per calendar quarter, up to a maximum of $75 million per
fiscal year so long as we are not in default at the time of the declaration. The
2006 Loan Agreement also contains various representations and warranties,
regarding, among others, compliance with material laws, the accuracy of
financial statements and other information delivered to the Lenders and the
absence of material changes.
In the event of a default under the 2006 Loan Agreement, the Lenders may
terminate the commitments made under the Loan Agreement, declare amounts
outstanding, including accrued interest and fees, payable immediately, and
enforce any and all rights and interests.
NOTE PLACEMENT
On May 25, 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with several
institutional investors for the issuance and sale by TALX in a private placement
of Senior Guaranteed Notes due May 25, 2014 the Notes in an aggregate
principal amount of $750 million the Note Purchase Agreement. We used the
proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay outstanding loans in the amount of
$742 million under the 2005 Loan Agreement.
We are required to repay the principal amount of the Notes in five annual
installments commencing on May 25, 2010 with the final payment of all principal
then outstanding on May 25, 2014. We may prepay the Notes subject to certain
restrictions and the payment of a make-whole amount. In addition, we may be
required by the holders of the Notes to prepay the Notes upon the occurrence of
a Change of Control, as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement. Under certain
circumstances, we may also be required to use proceeds of certain asset
dispositions to prepay a portion of the Notes.
Interest on the Notes of 689% per annum is payable semiannually until the
principal becomes due and payable, provided, that the interest rate increases by
045% unless we increase equity capital by $75 million before September 30,
2006; provided further, if such increase takes place after September 30, 2006
and before September 30, 2007, then on and after the first day of the next
fiscal quarter following the fiscal quarter in which such equity capital was
raised, such additional interest will no longer accrue and be payable, and the
interest rate on the Notes will return to 689% per annum, subject in any event
to the immediately following sentence. To the extent permitted by law, upon the
occurrence of an event of default, interest accrues on any amount due at a rate
equal to the greater of 889% or 20% over prime as announced by LaSalle Bank
National Association. Our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note
Purchase Agreement are absolutely and unconditionally guaranteed by our material
subsidiaries.
The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary covenants, including compliance
with laws, maintenance of insurance, keeping of books, conduct of business,
maintenance of properties, payment of taxes, inspection of records, furnishing
of quarterly and annual financial statements, quarterly compliance certificates
and other financial information.
The Note Purchase Agreement also contains customary restrictive covenants
including certain restrictions on transactions with affiliates, our Consolidated
Net Worth as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, other indebtedness,
including that of guarantor subsidiaries, our ratio of Consolidated Income
Available for Fixed Charges to Consolidated Fixed Charges as defined in the
Note Purchase Agreement, our ratio of Consolidated Debt to Consolidated
Operating Cash Flow as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement, liens and
encumbrances, consolidations and mergers, and sales of assets.
Except as described below, upon the happening of an event of default under the
Note Purchase Agreement, the holder or holders of more than 50% in principal
amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time at its or their
option, by notice or notices to us, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be
immediately due and payable. If an event of default with respect to the payment
of principal or interest on the Notes occurs, any holder or holders of the Notes
at the time outstanding
66 affected by such event of default may at any time at its or their option, by
notice or notices to us, declare all of the Notes held by it or them to be
immediately due and payable. If an event of default with respect to bankruptcy
proceedings occurs, all of the Notes then outstanding will become immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of any holders
of the Notes.

performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15e, as of March 31, 2006,
and determined that such controls and procedures are effective as of that date
to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by
us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. They have also determined in their
evaluation that there was no significant change in our internal control over
financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2006 that has materially
affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting.
It should be noted that while our management, including the Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer and Assistant Secretary, believe our disclosure controls and procedures
provide a reasonable level of assurance, they do not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all error and all
fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived or operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be
considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual
acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management
override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be
no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected.
