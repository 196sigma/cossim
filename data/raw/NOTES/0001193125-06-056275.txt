iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004  1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a
Nature of Business iGATE Corporation the Company is a worldwide provider of information technology IT and
offshore outsourcing services to large and medium-sized organizations. b Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company accounts for investments in businesses in which it owns between 20% and 50% of equity or otherwise acquires management influence using the equity method as prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. Investments in which the Company acquires less than a 20% interest, or in which the Company does not acquire management
influence, are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or, if publicly traded, as available-for-sale securities. c Uses of
Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. d Reclassifications Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to 2005 presentations. See Note 13 for further information.
e Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates market value. f Short-Term Investments Short-term investments consist of money market funds and corporate bonds and are stated at cost which approximates fair value. g Accounts Receivable and Unbilled Receivables The Company extends credit to clients based upon managements
assessment of their creditworthiness. Substantially all of the Companys revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from Fortune 1000 companies, major systems integrators and governmental agencies. Unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of
client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods. 
45 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
h Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts Accounts receivables are reviewed periodically to determine the probability of loss. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the
combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible, as well as judgments made by the Company based upon historical and expected charge-off experience. i Employee Advances Employees can
be advanced up to $2,500 at the discretion of the Company. Normally, advances are based upon financial need at date of hire. Advances are deducted from the employees salary over a six-month period or until paid in full. j Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates The Company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities SFAS 115. The Company has determined that certain of its investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, utilizing the investments closing price at each
reporting period. These investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with the unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of
Shareholders Equity and Comprehensive Loss. The unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the Companys original cost for an investment and the investments fair value at each reporting period. Realized gains or losses on
securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method. If management determines that an investment in available for sale
securities has sustained an other-than-temporary decline in its value, the investment is written down to its fair value, by a charge to earnings. Such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances. Factors that are considered by
the Company in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis; the financial condition of the investee; and the intent and ability to retain the
investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment. In evaluating these factors above,
management presumes a decline in value to be other-than-temporary if the market price of the security is 20% or more below the investments cost basis for a period of six months or more the 20% criteria. However, the presumption
of an other-than-temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature e.g., strong operating performance of investee, historical volatility of investee, etc.
Additionally, there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the 20% criteria is not satisfied e.g., plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the Companys cost basis. During 2003, the
Company incurred impairment losses deemed to be other-than-temporary. These impairments are disclosed in Note 4. No such impairment losses were incurred in 2005 or 2004. For investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting, management evaluates information e.g., budgets, business plans, financial statements, etc. in addition to quoted market price, if any, in
determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value exists. Factors indicative of an other-than-temporary decline include recurring operating losses, credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of
an investment. This list is not all inclusive and management weighs all 
46 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
quantitative factors in determining if an other-than-temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred. In 2005, the Company recorded an impairment of
$25 million on its investment in Concours, Inc. There were no impairments recorded in 2004. k Land, Building, Equipment and
Leasehold Improvements Property and equipment are stated at cost. The Company provides for depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Companys accounts and the resulting gains and losses are reflected in loss from operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Improvement and betterments that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are as follows:  Building
25 years
Laptop Computers
18 months
Equipment
35 years
Leasehold Improvements
Shorter of the life of the improvement or lease term ranging from 3 to 10 years
l Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired. Under SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill
and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment assessment of their carrying value. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology, recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof. For further
discussions, see Note 5. The cost of other acquired intangibles is amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are as follows:  Intellectual property
35years
Customer relationships
36 years
Beneficial employment contracts
24 years
The Company assesses the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including land, building,
equipment and leasehold improvement and amortizable intangible assets, whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are considered to be impaired when
the sum of the undiscounted expected future net operating cash flows is less than the carrying values of the related assets. m Income
Taxes Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the
Companys assets and liabilities. The Company has evaluated its deferred tax asset and has recorded a valuation allowance where appropriate.

31, 2005 AND 2004 
Historically, the government of India has provided incentives, in the form of tax holidays, to
encourage foreign investment. Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, the Companys Indian subsidiary is eligible to claim a tax holiday for 10 consecutive assessment years on profits derived from the export of software services from divisions
registered under the Software Technology Parks at Bangalore, Chennai and Pune. The benefits of the holiday began to expire for certain of the units in 2005. The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on basis differences in its non-U.S. subsidiaries of $58 million that result primarily from undistributed earnings the Company
intends to reinvest indefinitely. Determination of the deferred income tax liability on these basis differences is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs. n Minority Interest Minority
interest represents the proportionate share of outside equity holders. At December31, 2005 and 2004, the Company had outside equity holders for the following Companies:  Percentage Outside Ownership 2005 2004 iGATE Global Solutions Ltd. iGS
184 179 Quintant, Inc. Quintant
184 179 DiagnoSearch
5 5 iGS is a publicly held Company in India. All outside shareholders may vote. o Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate that fair value: Cash and short-term investmentsThe carrying amount approximates market value. Accounts receivableThe carrying amount approximates market. Revolving credit facilityThe carrying amount approximates market value. The outstanding balance is reflected at its outstanding face value, excluding unpaid accrued interest at an interest rate at the
lesser of the current LIBOR rate+125% or the Prime rate +025%, calculated on a per annum basis. Accounts payableThe
carrying amount approximates market. p Derivatives Instruments and Hedging Activities The Company uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging currency, price, and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of ongoing
business operations. The Company carries derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value, determined by reference to quoted market prices. Derivatives are included in other assets and other liabilities based on the instruments fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value 
48 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the reason for holding it.
The cash flows related to derivative instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within operating activities as a component of other items, net. The Company recorded $12 million in other expense in 2005 and $01 million in other income in 2004 related to its foreign currency hedging transactions.
q Stock-Based Employee Compensation The Company has stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 11. SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 gives companies the option
to adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method, as outlined under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. The Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and discloses the pro-forma effect as if the fair value method had been
applied. The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation:  Year ended December31 2005 2004 2003 in thousands, except per shareamounts Net income loss, as reported 6,969 18,211 9,020 Add: Deferred compensation expense reported in earnings 815 14,296 1,631 Less: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards and deferred compensation

included as a component of other comprehensive loss. Gain and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other expense income, net for the periods presented. Foreign exchange gains or losses on intercompany loans from the Company to its operating subsidiaries are recorded as a component of other income if
payment is expected in the foreseeable future based upon mutually agreed upon payment terms. s Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue on time-and-materials contracts as the services are performed. Revenue is earned when the Companys consultants are
working on projects. Revenue recognition is negatively impacted by national holidays and consultant vacation and sick days. Revenues on fixed-price contracts are recognized using the proportional performance method. Performance is determined by
relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract and revenue is recognized based upon costs incurred by the Companys consultants during the period. If the Companys estimates indicate a loss
on a particular fixed-price contract, we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion. Changes in job performance, conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are
recognized in the period in which the changes are identified. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones recognize revenue as the deliverables or project milestones are achieved. Contracts with deliverables or project milestones can provide
for certain penalties if the deliverables or project milestones are not met within contract timelines. Certain maintenance type contracts with no stated deliverables, with a designated workforce assigned, recognize revenues on a straight-line basis
over the life of the contract, which are typically one year in duration. Revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract. In certain client situations, where the nature of the engagement requires it, we utilize the services of other companies in our industry. If these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we agree to retain
only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs, we classify the amount billed to the client as subcontractor revenue. These revenues, however, are recorded on a gross versus net 
50 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER
31, 2005 AND 2004 
basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client. All revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other
independent contractors who work directly for us are recorded as direct revenue. t Software Implementation Costs The Company accounts for costs incurred for its own information systems upgrades in accordance with Statement of Position 98-1 SOP 98-1
Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. SOP 98-1 requires that both internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage should be charged to operations as
incurred. Such costs incurred during the application development stage should be capitalized; training costs incurred in this stage should, however, be expensed. Costs of upgrades and enhancements should be capitalized but only during the
application development stage if it is probable that the expenditures will result in added functionality for the software. During the post-implementation/operation stage, training costs both internal and external and maintenance costs should be
charged to operations. u Gains on Issuance of Stock by Subsidiaries At the time a subsidiary sells its stock to unrelated parties at a price in excess of its book value, the Companys investment in that
subsidiarys net assets increases. If at that time, the subsidiary is not a newly- formed, non-operating entity, nor a research and development, start-up, or development-stage company, nor is there a question as to the subsidiarys ability
to continue in existence, the Company records the increase as a gain in its Consolidated Statement of Operations. v Acquisitions
The Companys acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values. Any excess purchase price over the fair market value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. For all acquisitions, operating results are included in the Consolidated
Statement of Loss since the dates of the acquisitions. See Note 12 for additional information. w Discontinued Operations
The Company adopted SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, SFAS
144 effective January1, 2002. This standard establishes accounting and reporting requirements for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company applied the provisions of SFAS 144 related to the sale of its Australian
Australia and Direct Resources International DRI subsidiaries in 2004. Managements plan to divest and
the divestures both occurred within the same period for reporting purposes. Australia and DRI were classified in the Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. The balance sheet amounts and statement results were reclassified to
discontinued operations for both the Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations presentation. The discontinued operations on the Statement of Operations were reported, net of applicable statutory taxes and net of gains on the sales of Australia and
DRI. Additionally, segment information does not include the results of businesses classified as discontinued operations. The Companys management does not expect any continuing involvement with these businesses following the sales.

x Net Income per Share The Company calculates net income per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted shares included in this
calculation are determined using the treasury stock method. Because the Company was in an income position, it did include all stock options outstanding whose exercise price were below the average market price. y Recently Issued Accounting Standards In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB No123 R, Share-based Payment. FASB No123 Rrequires employers to value share-based payments using the fair value method,
eliminating the option to use the intrinsic method to value such payments. The Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS R prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2006. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of the provision of
this statement on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In March2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FIN 47, an interpretation of SFAS 143. FIN 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in SFAS
143 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. An entity is required to recognize
a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated, even if conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after
December15, 2005. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May
2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Statement No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections as amended FASB 154. This Statement replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and
FASB Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. This Statement applies to all voluntary changes in
accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions. This Statement shall be effective for accounting changes and
corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2005. This Statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements, including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective
date of this Statement.  2.
Restricted Cash and Investments The Company has
short-term investments consisting of money market funds and corporate bonds that totaled $308 million and $359 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Approximately $58million and $109 million of these funds at
December31, 2005 and 2004 are to be used exclusively by iGS due to Indian governmental restrictions. The Company had compensating
balances classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as short-term investments which consisted of money market funds that totaled $250 million at December31, 2005 and 2004. The restrictions related to the Credit Facility are discussed in
Note 7. The compensating balance may be withdrawn, but the availability of short-term lines of credit is dependent upon maintenance of such compensating balances.

In 2005, iGS has entered into forward contracts to hedge intercompany cash flows. These contracts will mature within one year from the
Companys fiscal year-end. As each contract matures, iGS will receive Rupees at the contracted strike price rate while delivering the USD equivalent of Rupees at the prevailing Rupee exchange rate. Contracts that meet qualifying
criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss

and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. At December31, 2005 these forward contracts did not meet qualifying criteria to receive hedge accounting and, as such, iGS appropriately
recorded the net unrealized loss of $03 million as Other Expense. In 2005, iGS has entered into option contracts to hedge intercompany
cash flows. These contracts mature within one year from the Companys fiscal year-end. As each contract matures and dependent upon prevailing Rupee exchange rates, iGS will have the option to either buy USDs at each contracted put
strike price or sell USDs at each contracted call strike price. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a
component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in
current period earnings in other income and expense. At December31, 2005 these option contracts did not meet qualifying criteria to receive hedge accounting and, as such, iGS appropriately recorded the net unrealized loss of $06 million as
Other Expense. In 2005 all fair value hedges were deemed to be ineffective due to the lack of an underlying asset or transaction to be
hedged. They will expire within six months. At December31, 2005 iGS approximately recorded $04 million as Other Expense. In 2005,
iGS has entered into principal swaps to hedge intercompany debt from iGS to iGATE. These contracts will mature within one year from the Companys fiscal year-end. Contracts that meet qualifying criteria are accounted for as foreign currency
cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings. Any gains and losses due to hedge
ineffectiveness or related to contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded in current period earnings in other income and expense. At December31, 2005, the principal swaps to hedge intercompany debt did not meet qualifying
criteria to receive hedge accounting and iGS appropriately recorded the net unrealized gain of $01 million as Other Income. Substantially
all of the Companys foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies. Accordingly, exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material.

Restructuring, Merger and Goodwill Impairment Charges In 2004, the Company restructured its Canadian and United Kingdom operations. The Company incurred $09 million of early exit costs associated with its Toronto, Canada office. The Company incurred approximately $49 million related to the
closing of its Red Brigade Ltd. office in Bracknell, UK, which was comprised of $46million of early exit costs associated with the closing and $03 million of non cash charges related to write-offs of leasehold improvements associated with
the leased property. As part of the restructuring six employees were eliminated. These employees were executive level, administrative and back office support. In 2005, the Company sold its Canadian operation and recovered $05 million of costs that
were previously recorded as restructuring expenses. In 2003, the Company recorded $01 million in severance related costs associated with
the offshore outsourcing of certain of its back office finance and accounting functions at iGATE Corporate. The 13 employees who were severed ranged from clerical to middle management. These costs were recognized in accordance with SFAS
No146. The following paragraphs discuss the Companys restructurings of its business. All costs associated with restructurings
occurring in 2002 and 2001 were accounted for in accordance with EITF 94-3, Liability Recognition for Costs to Exit an Activity.  During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company incurred $42 million of costs associated with a restructuring of certain of its business units as well as departments within the iGATE corporate structure. The restructuring was due in part to
iGSs agreed upon purchase of eJivas stock, to align the Companys business units to increase focus on global offshore delivery and to consolidate the Companys back office operations. The back office consolidation of operations
included legal, accounting, marketing and human resource departments. As part of the restructuring, the Company vacated all non-essential properties and all remaining employees were relocated to a centralized location. As part of the restructuring,
the Company eliminated 96 U.S. positions. These employees were executive level, back office support and administrative positions that were no longer being utilized. These actions were necessary due to the streamlining of the Companys back
office operations and due to redundancies of effort. Of the total costs incurred as part of the restructuring, non-cash charges totaling $08million were related to write-offs of leasehold improvements on abandoned leased property. In 2003,
the Company adjusted its original estimate of restructuring reserves, recognizing additional costs of $05 million related to rent expense due to the Companys inability to sub-lease its excess space. In the third quarter of 2001, the continued economic downturn caused the Company to perform an extensive review of its operations and certain overhead
costs associated with each reportable segment. In August 2001, the Company approved a restructuring plan the plan. Based upon its revenue trends and the general economic environment, the Company decided to put a plan in place that
would serve to cut excess costs in certain of the operating segments. As part of this plan, the Company recorded severance costs in the amount of $10 million. The Company reduced employee headcount by 84. These employees ranged from executive level
through administrative assistants, and affected the iGATE Solutions, iGATE Professional Services and iGATE Corporate segments. The Company also recorded a $24 million charge for a bonus for one of its key executives. The Company also performed an
extensive fixed asset inventory in each reportable segment, in order to identify any fixed assets, such as laptops and computer equipment that were deemed to be in excess due to the headcount reduction. Based upon the fixed asset inventory, the
Company recorded write-downs of $21 million. These write-downs of excess equipment were recorded in the iGATE Solutions, iGATE Professional Services and iGATE Corporate segments. The Company also decided to exit its training function at the iGATE
Corporate level in favor of a more decentralized approach. Exit costs associated with the training department were $08 million and consisted of education-related licensing agreements entered into that would no longer be utilized. In 
58 Table of Contents iGATE CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued AS OF DECEMBER

the iGATE Professional Services segment, the Company recorded a charge of $13 million for lease costs associated with the closure of its office in San
Francisco. The Companys total charge for the plan totaled $76 million. These steps were necessary due to declines in demand and overall headcount. In December 2001, the Company severed 3 employees of its wholly owned subsidiary Global Financial Services of Nevada, ranging from executive level to general and administrative support and incurred a charge of $02
million. In December 2001, Innovative Resource Group, Inc. IRG, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into eJiva. As part of the merger, eJiva incurred $14 million of merger related exit costs associated with a
leased space in Pittsburgh, PA. The merged eJiva entity relocated to IRG office space. The components of the restructuring charges and the

Goodwill Impairment As discussed in Note 1 on January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142, which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life. Instead, SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of SFAS 142 and, at a minimum, annually thereafter. 
There was no goodwill impairment in 2005 and 2004. Under SFAS 142, goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Other than the allocation of goodwill, which is discussed below, the net book value of
each of the Companys segments was generally based upon its carrying value. The Companys reporting units are generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the segments identified in Note 16. The Company performed a
transitional impairment review during the first quarter of 2002, and concluded that no impairment was necessary. During the fourth quarter
of 2003, the Company reviewed its indefinite lived goodwill for impairment, using a discounted cash model to determine the market value of certain reporting units with assigned goodwill. Based upon the review, the Company was required to record
impairment charges of $39 million related to its discontinued Australian operations.  7.
Credit Facilities On September14, 2005, the
Company renewed its secured credit facility Renewed Facility with PNC Bank N.A. PNC. The Renewed Facility provides a maximum loan amount of $250 million and is secured entirely by the Companys cash and cash
equivalents. The provisions of the Renewed Facility requires the Company to maintain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of at least $300 million and maintain tangible net worth of at least $880 million. The Company had letters of credit
outstanding in the amount of $04 million and $03 million on the Renewed Facility as of December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.  8.

Earningsper Share The reconciliation between
basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations is as follows:  Year Ended December31 2005

exceeded the average market price of the common shares aggregated 11million, 13million and 15million shares for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These options were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings per share under the treasury stock method. In addition, the calculation of diluted earnings per share for
2004 and 2003, respectively, would have included 04million and 04million shares for assumed exercise of options under the Companys share incentive plans. However, because the Company was in a net loss position inclusion of such
shares would have been anti-dilutive.  16.
Segment Reporting The Companys reportable
segments are iGATE Solutions, iGATE Professional Services and iGATE Corporate. Effective April1, 2004, we recast our segments to include the operations of Global Financial Services GFS as part of the iGATE Professional Services

Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, interest income and expense, equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates, minority interest, loss from joint ventures and
restructuring charges not identified to a specific segment, and other unallocated charges. The Company evaluates segments based on income loss from operations. Since certain administrative and other operating expenses or income sources have not
been allocated to the operating business segments, this basis is not necessarily a measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and it may not be comparable to other companies.

The Company entered into a consulting arrangement with Primentor Consulting to provide human resource
consulting services. Primentor Consulting was founded by Phaneesh Murthy, CEO of iGS. The Company paid $04 million for these services during 2003. The Company has advanced employees $11 million and $14 million at December31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. These advances do not exceed $2,500 per employee and are typically deducted from the employees salary over a six-month
period or until paid in full. At December31, 2005, Sunil Wadhwani, CEO and Co-Founder of iGATE Corporation, directly owned
12,738,791 common shares of the Company and indirectly owned 2,562,262 common shares of the Company through various family trusts. At

and Ashok Trivedi, the Companys Co-Chairman and President. Messrs. Wadhwani and Trivedi own various properties jointly and individually. The acquisitions of the real estate and the construction of the office buildings, excluding build-outs of

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and
Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Company
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15b and 15d-15b. Based upon, and as of the date of this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
effective. The results of managements assessment were reviewed with the Companys Audit Committee. Managements Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005. In
making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a
remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Management has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting and has not identified any material weaknesses. Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Prior Year Material Weaknesses. As of December31, 2004, the Company did not maintain effective controls over 1accounting for customer accounts receivable and the
corresponding revenue, specifically ineffective controls over restricted system access to the accounts receivable module, monitoring of cash payments received from customers and the issuance of customer credit memos and discounts, 2the
calculation 
78 Table of Contents
and review of deferred compensation and the corresponding compensation expense, specifically the controls did not identify a computation error in determining
the amount of compensation expense to be recognized from the cancellation of 21million shares of restricted stock and the related cash payments made to the Quintant Inc. founders, and 3the calculation and review of income taxes,
including the determination of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the related income tax provision, specifically, the Company did not perform an effective review of income tax calculations performed by subsidiaries
that are included in the consolidated income tax provision. In addition, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the access and use of the application used in the computation of the consolidated income tax provision. The following are high-level descriptions of the Companys remediation efforts. 1 Customer Accounts Receivable and Corresponding Revenue In April 2005, the Company began to transition all components of its North American Professional Services segment IPS customer accounts receivable and revenue processes from its location in Bangalore,
India to its North American Headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in order to directly supervise all accounts receivable and revenue processes. Since the April 2005 transition back to the U.S., all processes related to customer accounts
receivable and revenue have been performed by the Companys U.S. accounting and finance staff. The Company hired additional employees at its Headquarters to manage, oversee and assume individual customer collection and administrative interface
responsibility. This process change has improved the understanding of the specific customer terms and the ability to quickly implement corrections to files or individual invoices if required. In May 2005, the Company also began a detailed review and analysis of its functional procedures relative to its customer accounts receivable and revenue
processes. This review and remediation project included updating key control documentation, developing desktop procedures for each job description, and standardizing business rules, policies and procedures across the organization. As of
December31, 2005, the Company has completed the documentation and testing of the controls. The Company has determined the controls are functioning as designed. The Company also engaged a third party consulting firm, which specializes in PeopleSoft Software Systems, to review access and security issues with the Companys accounting software to ensure the ability to
simplify the addition of specific customer terms and promptly change data files if required to adjust incorrect terms while maintaining strict security access and control of the files. The purpose of this review was to identify system access and
security control deficiencies that required improvement. In May 2005, the Company formed a five employee technical team to remediate and strengthen the procedures and controls related to the software. This remediation effort was completed by
December 31, 2005. 2 Calculation and Review of Deferred Compensation The Company viewed this weakness as a one-time occurrence related to the accounting for a very complex acquisition. The Company has revised its policies
and procedures regarding the accounting for acquisitions and in the future will have additional management personnel review all detailed calculations for significant transactions of this type. The Company has already implemented a detailed Audit
Committee checklist which is reviewed by the Audit Committee at every Committee meeting. The checklist describes, in detail, all significant accounting and reporting issues that have occurred during the quarter. The checklist was implemented during
the Companys second quarter 2005 Form 10-Q reporting period. This internal control process was finalized by September30, 2005. 3 Calculation and Review of Income Taxes Payable, Deferred Income Taxes and Related Tax Provision The Company began to
formulate its tax control structure in December 2004. The Company has implemented a formalized review process for all of its subsidiaries. The Company tested this structure for the second and third quarters of 2005 to ensure that the review process
was functioning as designed. The Company 
79 Table of Contents
has evaluated its control environment regarding the access and use of the applications used in the computation of the consolidated income tax provision and
related footnote disclosures and believes it has necessary access controls and review and approvals controls in place. The Company contracted with an independent third party consulting firm that specializes in control processes and documentation to
review the established structure for consistency and then tested this structure for compliance noting no exceptions. This remediation effort was completed by December 31, 2005. Managements Remediation Efforts The material weaknesses described above resulted in audit adjustments to the fourth quarter 2004 consolidated financial statements of approximately $800,000, $1,300,000 and $0, respectively. To address these material weaknesses, the Company
performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures to ensure that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management believes that the financial
statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change in iGATEs internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, such internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2005.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders iGate Corporation Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report that iGate Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Standards Board United States, the consolidated balance sheet of iGate Corporation as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders
equity and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated March 3, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. /s/ BDO Seidman, LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin March 3, 2006
