INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Century Aluminum Company:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Century
Aluminum Company and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 1997 and
1996, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1997. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Century Aluminum Company and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Basis of Presentation -- Century Aluminum Company
Century or the Company is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is
Century Aluminum of West Virginia, Inc. Century of West Virginia, formerly
known as Ravenswood Aluminum Corporation, which operates a primary aluminum
reduction facility and an aluminum fabrication facility in Ravenswood, West
Virginia. Century of West Virginia, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Berkeley Aluminum, Inc. Berkeley, holds a 2667% interest in a partnership
which operates a primary aluminum reduction facility in Mt. Holly, South
Carolina the Mt. Holly Facility and a 2667% undivided interest in the
property, plant and equipment comprising the Mt. Holly Facility. As of December
31, 1997, the remaining interest in the partnership and the remaining undivided
interest in the Mt. Holly Facility are owned 5033% by Alumax of South Carolina,
Inc. ASC and 2300% by a subsidiary of Sudelektra Holding AG, a publicly
traded Swiss company. Glencore International AG Glencore and together with
its subsidiaries, the Glencore Group is a major shareholder of Sudelektra
Holding AG. ASC manages and operates the facility pursuant to an Owners
Agreement, prohibiting the disposal of the interest held by any of the owners
without the consent of the other owners and providing for certain rights of
first refusal. Pursuant to the Owners Agreement, each owner furnishes its own
alumina, or alumina owned by an affiliate, for conversion to aluminum and is
responsible for its pro rata share of the operating and conversion costs.
The Company produces primary aluminum products and manufactures aluminum
sheet and plate products.
As explained in Note 11, the Company had holdings in a number of other
entities in unrelated businesses that are presented as discontinued operations
because the Company made a special distribution, in the form of a pro rata
redemption of shares of its then current shareholders, comprised of these
holdings effective March 28, 1996. The disclosures herein relate to continuing
operations, unless otherwise indicated.
Prior to April 1996, the Company was an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
of Glencore. In April 1996, the Company completed an initial public offering of
its common stock. At December 31, 1997, the Glencore Group owned 396% of
Century common shares outstanding.
Prior to 1996, Century of West Virginia and Berkeley operated as separate
entities, under the control of Glencore. As explained in Notes 7, 14 and 15,
these two companies have had significant related party transactions with
Glencore Ltd. and its affiliates. Glencore Ltd. is a U.S. branch of Glencore AG,
which in turn, is wholly-owned by Glencore.
On April 26, 1995, Berkeley and Virgin Islands Alumina Corporation
Vialco, whose principal asset was an inactive alumina refinery in the United
States Virgin Islands see Note 12, became subsidiaries of Century of West
Virginia. Substantially all of Vialco assets were sold to an unrelated buyer
on July 24, 1995. The difference between the assets and liabilities of Vialco
was recorded as additional paid-in capital.
The Company historical results of operations included in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of the results of
operations to be expected in the future.
Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Century Aluminum Company and its subsidiaries, after
elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and accounts.
Berkeley interest in the Mt. Holly partnership is accounted for under the
equity method. There are no material undistributed earnings in the Mt. Holly
partnership.
Revenue -- Revenue is recognized when title passes to customers in
accordance with contract terms, which may precede or coincide with shipments to
customers. Included in net sales are tolling fees which the Company earns from
smelting, casting and fabricating material supplied by third-party customers and
related
26
27
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
parties. Net sales include tolling fees of $14,428, $32,480 and $132,017 for the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Sales returns and
allowances are treated as a reduction of sales and are provided for based on
historical experience and current estimates.
Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents -- Cash and restricted cash
equivalents are comprised of cash and short-term investments having maturities
of less than 90 days at the time of purchase. The carrying amount of cash and
restricted cash equivalents approximates fair value.
Accounts Receivable -- The accounts receivable, trade are net of an
allowance for uncollectable accounts of $2,270 and $1,700 at December 31, 1997
and 1996, respectively.
Inventories -- Alumina and aluminum inventories are stated at the
lower-of-cost using the last-in, first-out LIFO method or market. The
remaining inventories operating and other supplies are valued at the lower of
average cost or market.
Property, Plant and Equipment -- Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Asset and
accumulated depreciation accounts are relieved for dispositions with resulting
gains or losses included in earnings. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is provided for by the
straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Buildings and  14 to 40 years
Machinery and   5 to 22 years
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be
recoverable.
Other Assets -- At December 31, 1997, other assets consist primarily of the
Company investment in the Mt. Holly partnership and deferred tax assets. At
December 31, 1996, other assets consist primarily of the pension asset
recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions,
the Company investment in the Mt. Holly partnership and deferred tax assets.
Income Taxes -- The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability
method, whereby deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In valuing
deferred tax assets, the Company uses judgment in considering the relative
impact of negative and positive evidence. The weight given to the potential
effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to
which it can be objectively verified. Based on the weight of evidence, both
negative and positive, including the lack of historical earnings, if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized, a valuation allowance is established.
Interest Expense -- Net -- The Company does not have significant interest
income. Interest incurred in the construction of qualifying assets is
capitalized as a component of the construction costs.
Postemployment Benefits -- The Company provides certain postemployment
benefits to former and inactive employees and their dependents during the period
following employment, but before retirement. These benefits include salary
continuance, supplemental unemployment and disability healthcare. Postemployment
benefits are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits. The statement requires recognition of
the estimated future cost of providing postemployment benefits on an accrual
basis over the active service life of the employee.
Fixed-Price Commitments and Forward Contracts -- The Company has entered
into various fixed-price commitments to purchase alumina and primary aluminum
and to sell primary and scrap aluminum and aluminum sheet and plate products.
Unrealized losses and recoveries of previously recognized unrealized
27
28
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
losses on fixed-price commitments are recognized as adjustments to cost of
goods sold in the period in which they arise. Gains on such commitments are
recognized when the ultimate sale is completed.
The Company enters into forward primary aluminum contracts, principally
with the Glencore Group, to hedge fixed-price purchase and sale commitments and
inventory positions specific contracts and to cover expected future sales
and to otherwise manage the Company exposure to changing prices general
contracts. A change in market value of a forward contract is recognized as a
gain or loss in the period of change unless the contract meets specific criteria
to qualify for hedge accounting. The criteria are: the item to be hedged exposes
the Company to market price risk, the forward contract reduces exposure to this
risk, the forward contract is designated as a hedge, and there is a high degree
of correlation between changes in the market value of the contract and changes
in the market value of the hedged item. Changes in the market value of forward
contracts that qualify for hedge accounting, including closed forward contracts,
are deferred and reflected in cost of goods sold when the underlying physical
transaction takes place. The deferred gains and losses are reflected on the
balance sheet in inventory. If a forward contract is used to hedge an
anticipated transaction and the transaction is no longer likely to occur, any
gains or losses are included in the income statement as cost of goods sold.
Changes in the market value of specific contracts that do not meet the
criteria for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement as cost of
goods sold in the period in which they arise. Changes in the market value of
general contracts are recognized in the income statement as gains or losses on
forward contracts in the period in which they arise.
Financial Instruments -- The Company financial instruments principally
receivables, payables, debt and certain forward contracts are carried at
amounts which approximate fair value.
Concentration of Credit Risk -- Financial instruments, in addition to
forward contracts, which potentially expose the Company to concentrations of
credit risk, consist principally of cash investments and trade receivables. The
Company places its cash investments with highly-rated financial institutions. At
times, such investments may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due
to the large number of customers comprising the Company customer base, and
their dispersion across many different geographical regions and markets. The
Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers, but
generally does not require collateral to support trade receivables.
Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company has elected not to adopt the
recognition provisions for employee stock-based compensation as permitted in
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Reclassifications -- Certain reclassifications of 1996 and 1995 information
were made to conform to the 1997 presentation.

amended through February 13, 1998, is for a three-year term and consists of
revolving loans and letters of credit made to each of Century of West Virginia
and Berkeley of up to $150,000 in the aggregate $40,000 for letters of credit.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
Subject to certain limitations, the borrowers may select base rate or LIBOR
loans. The interest rate is i for base loans, 075% in excess of the base
rate, which is the rate publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America
as its reference rate, or ii for LIBOR loans, 200% in excess of the one two-, three- or six-month LIBOR as quoted from time to time by Bank of America.
The interest rate margins of 75% and 200% may remain constant, or may be
increased by up to 50%, depending upon the attainment of certain financial
ratios. Interest is payable monthly on base rate loans and at the end of the
applicable interest period on LIBOR loans quarterly on six-month LIBOR loans.
The interest rate on the borrowings under the Facility was 838% on December 31,
1997.
The loans are secured by a first priority security interest in all of
Century of West Virginia and Berkeley inventory, receivables, contract
rights and general intangibles.
The Company has paid commitment and closing fees in the aggregate amount of
$1,760 in connection with the Facility. Other fees include: i unused line and
administration fees, payable monthly, at the aggregate rate of 375% per annum,
on the difference between $150,000 and the amount actually borrowed including
the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit and ii monthly letter of
credit fees which are equal to 175% per annum of the undrawn amount of each
outstanding letter of credit.
Century has guaranteed all obligations of Century of West Virginia and
Berkeley under the Facility. The guaranty is secured by all of Century present
and future inventory and receivables.
The Facility provides for various restrictive covenants, including the
following: i standard restrictions on dispositions of property or assets
except in the ordinary course of business, ii restrictions on the incurrence
of indebtedness and liens and the making of capital expenditures and
investments, iii a prohibition on the payment of dividends except dividends up

6. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Pension Benefits
The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
covering substantially all of its employees. For salaried employees, plan
benefits are based primarily on years of service and average compensation during
the later years of employment. For hourly employees, plan benefits are based
primarily on a formula that provides a specific benefit for each year of
service. The Company funding policy is to contribute annually an amount based
upon actuarial and economic assumptions designed to achieve adequate funding of
the projected benefit obligations and to meet the minimum funding requirements
of ERISA. Plan assets consist principally of U.S. equity securities,
international equity securities, growth funds and fixed income accounts. As
explained in Note 13, the Company agreed to make additional contributions to the
hourly plan in connection with the initial public offering of the Company
common stock. In addition, the Company provides supplemental executive
retirement benefits for its executive officers.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, the Company recorded an
additional minimum liability of $4,195 at December 31, 1996, representing the
excess of unfunded accumulated benefit obligations over previously recorded
pension cost liabilities. This amount was offset by an intangible pension asset
of $4,195 representing unrecognized prior service cost. At December 31, 1997,
the unfunded accumulated benefit obligations did not exceed previously recorded
pension cost liabilities. Accordingly, the additional minimum liability and
intangible pension asset were removed from the Company balance sheet.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
The Company sponsors a tax-deferred savings plan under which eligible
employees may elect to contribute specified percentages of their compensation
with the Company providing matching contributions. Effective February 1, 1995,
the contribution matching provision was 50% of the first 6% of a participant
annual compensation contributed to the savings plan. Effective July 1, 1996 the
contribution matching provision was increased to 60% of the first 6% of a
participant annual compensation contributed to the savings plan. One half of
the Company contribution is invested in the common stock of Century and one
half of the Company contribution is in cash. Company contributions to the
savings plan were $806, $661 and $488 for the years ended December 31, 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively.
Other Postretirement Benefits
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
healthcare and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees.
The Company accounts for these plans in accordance with SFAS No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. SFAS
No. 106 requires the Company to accrue the estimated cost of providing
postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could
become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds these
benefits as claims are submitted by the retirees.
The components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost are as follows:
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,
1997    1996    1995
Service  $ 2,786  $ 2,521  $ 2,313
Interest   9,676   9,212   9,116
Net amortization and deferral.   149    95    373
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost. $12,313  $11,638  $11,802
An additional one-percentage-point increase in the assumed rate of
inflation in future medical costs would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation at December 31, 1997 by $18,738 and would increase aggregate
1997 service and interest cost by $2,157.

7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Common Stock -- On February 19, 1996, the Board of Directors approved a
40,000 for 1 split of the Company common stock. The effect of the stock split
has been retroactively applied to the earliest period presented.
Preferred Stock -- Under the Company Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, with a par value of one cent per share, in one or
more series. The authorized but unissued preferred shares may be issued with
such dividend rates, conversion privileges, voting rights, redemption prices and
liquidation preferences as the Board of Directors may determine, without action
by shareholders.
Additional Paid-In Capital -- Amounts shown as capital contributions
include $450 net of income taxes of $300 in the year ended December 31, 1995,
representing the allocation of certain corporate expenses of Glencore AG. In
addition, on March 1, 1995, the Board of Directors of Century of West Virginia
agreed to accept an offer from Glencore to convert the $40,000 principal amount
then outstanding under a credit facility into additional paid-in capital.
8. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
1996 Stock Incentive Plan -- The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Incentive
Plan the Stock Incentive Plan for the purpose of awarding performance share
units and granting qualified incentive stock options and nonqualified stock
options to salaried officers and other key employees of the Company. The Stock
Incentive Plan has a term of ten years from its effective date. The number of
shares available under the Stock Incentive Plan is 1,200,000. Granted stock
options vest one-third on the grant date and an additional one-third on each of
the first and second anniversary dates. The Company awarded 460,000 performance
share units at the time of the initial public offering for no consideration. The
performance share units represent the right to receive common stock, on a
one-for-one basis on their vesting dates. The value of the performance share
units, $13 per share, is being charged to compensation expense over their five
year vesting period, which is one-third at the end of each of the third, fourth
and fifth anniversary dates. The performance share units do not affect the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock until conversion at the end of the
vesting periods. However, the performance share units are considered common
stock equivalents and therefore are included, using the treasury stock method,
in average common shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share
computations.
The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in
accounting for the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for the stock option portions of the plan. Had compensation
cost for the Stock Incentive Plan been determined based on the fair value at the
grant dates for awards under the plan consistent with the method of SFAS No.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
shares available under this plan is 200,000, of which 61,000 have been awarded.
The non-qualified options vest one-third on the grant date and an additional
one-third on each of the first and second anniversary dates. Each option granted
under this plan will be exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of
grant.

11. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
The Company made a special distribution of certain holdings of the Company
in the form of a pro rata redemption of shares of its then current shareholders
on March 28, 1996. The special distribution was comprised of the Company
holdings in several operations whose businesses were unrelated to the continuing
aluminum operations of the Company, consisting principally of an inactive oil
trading business, a distributor of ferro alloys and a finance business, whose
principal activities consisted of providing financing to entities within the
Glencore group of companies. The net assets and operating activities related to
the businesses comprising

12. SALE OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES
Vialco -- On April 26, 1995, Vialco became a subsidiary of Century of West
Virginia with assets of $60,000 together with $11,085 of liabilities and $48,915
of additional paid-in capital recorded on such date. On July 24, 1995, the
Company completed the sale for gross proceeds of $60,000, to an unrelated buyer,
of the production assets and inventories of the Vialco facility, which had been
idle since January 1995. There was no gain or loss on the sale. Concurrently
with the sale, the Company entered into a long-term alumina supply agreement
with the buyer and an affiliate of the buyer, as described in Note 14.
Management has determined that the alumina purchase prices in the agreement
approximate market prices. Under the terms of the sale, the buyer did not assume
certain of Vialco liabilities. See Note 13 for a discussion of certain
contingencies relating to Vialco.
The Bedford Facility -- On September 29, 1995, the Company sold its Bedford
facility in Bedford, Indiana for $8,500 and realized a gain of $3,744, which is
included in other income for the year ended December 31, 1995. The net assets
and the operating results of this facility, which are included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements to the date of sale, are not
material.
13. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
Environmental Contingencies
The Company operations are subject to various environmental laws and
regulations. The Company has spent, and expects to spend in the future,
significant amounts for compliance with those laws and regulations.
Pursuant to an order issued in September 1994 under Section 3008h the
3008h order of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA, Century
of West Virginia is performing remediation measures at a former oil pond area
and in connection with cyanide contamination in the groundwater, and is
conducting a RCRA facility investigation RFI and a corrective measures study
CMS to evaluate and develop corrective alternatives for any areas that have
contamination exceeding certain levels. The Company completed initial sampling
and analysis and submitted its initial findings to the Environmental Protection
Agency EPA. The EPA has requested that the Company perform additional field
work and testing. As a result, the Company anticipates that the RFI will not be
completed before late 1998. Once the RFI and CMS are complete, the EPA will
assess the need for clean-up, and if any clean-up is required, a subsequent
order will be issued. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the
extent of clean-up measures, if any, that may be required. However, the Company
is aware of some environmental contamination at Century of West Virginia, and it
is likely that clean-up activities will be required in at least some areas of
the facility. The Company believes a significant portion of this contamination
is attributable to the operations of a prior owner and will be the financial
responsibility of that owner, as discussed below.
38
39
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
Prior to the Company acquisition of the Century of West Virginia
facility, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corporation Kaiser owned and operated
the facility for approximately thirty years. Many of the conditions which the
Company is required to investigate under the 3008h order arise out of
activities which occurred during Kaiser ownership and operation, and with
respect to those conditions, Kaiser will be responsible for the costs of the RFI
and required cleanup under the terms of the purchase agreement Kaiser Purchase
Agreement. In addition, Kaiser retained title to certain land within the
Century of West Virginia premises and retains full responsibility for those
areas. Under current environmental laws and regulations, the Company may be
required to remediate any contamination discovered during or after completion of
the RFI, which contamination was discharged from areas which Kaiser previously
owned or operated, or for which Kaiser has retained ownership or responsibility.
However, if such remediation is required, the Company believes that Kaiser will
be liable for some or all of the costs thereof pursuant to the Kaiser Purchase
Agreement.
The Company is aware of two areas of contamination in the soil and
groundwater at its previously-owned Vialco facility. At the first of these
areas, the Company has removed quantities of contaminated soils and has
transported and disposed of such soils in approved facilities. In addition, it
has begun a bioremediation program which it believes will fulfill the remaining
legal requirements with respect to such soils. In the second area, the Company
believes that a substantial amount of the contamination originated from an
adjacent refinery owned by Hess Oil Virgin Islands, Inc. HOVIC. The Company
further believes that the vast majority of any contamination which did not
originate from HOVIC was caused by releases on the property which predated
Vialco ownership and will not be the legal responsibility of Vialco. Pursuant
to the Acquisition Agreement by which Vialco sold the premises to St. Croix
Alumina, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Alcoa Alumina and Chemicals L.L.S. St.
Croix, Vialco retained liability for environmental conditions existing at the
time of the sale only to the extent such conditions arose from operation of the
facility by Vialco. In addition, indemnification arises only if the conditions
require remediation or give rise to claims under the laws in effect at the time
of sale. Finally, St. Croix may not request indemnity from Vialco until St.
Croix has spent $300 on such environmental conditions and Vialco indemnity is
capped at $18,000. Management of the Company does not believe that the retained
liability, if any, will have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
It is the Company policy to accrue for costs associated with
environmental assessments and remedial efforts when it becomes probable that a
liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The
aggregate environmental related accrued liabilities were $1,052 and $800 at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. All accruals have been recorded
without giving effect to any possible future insurance or Kaiser indemnity
proceeds. With respect to ongoing environmental compliance costs, including
maintenance and monitoring, such costs are expensed as incurred.
Because of the issues and uncertainties described above, and the Company
inability to predict the requirements of future environmental laws, there can be
no assurance that future capital expenditures and costs for environmental
compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company future
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Based upon all
available information and after consultation with counsel, management does not
believe that the outcome of these environmental matters will have a material
adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results of operations or
liquidity.
Legal Contingencies
Century of West Virginia is a named defendant along with other companies
in approximately 3,873 civil actions brought by individuals seeking to recover
significant compensatory and/or punitive damages in connection with various
asbestos-related diseases. However, counsel for the plaintiffs have represented
that Century of West Virginia will be dismissed from 2,422 cases because the
plaintiffs in these cases had no
39

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
contact with the Century of West Virginia facility. All of the remaining 1,451
plaintiffs have been employees of independent contractors who claim to have been
exposed to asbestos in the course of performing services at various facilities,
including the Century of West Virginia facility. The cases are typically
resolved based upon factual determinations as to the facilities at which the
plaintiffs worked, the periods of time during which work was performed, the type
of work performed and the conditions in which work was performed. If the
plaintiffs' work was performed during the period when Kaiser owned the Century
of West Virginia facility, Kaiser has retained responsibility, pursuant to the
terms of the Kaiser Purchase Agreement, for defense and indemnity. If a
plaintiff is shown to have worked at the Century of West Virginia facility after
the time Century of West Virginia purchased the facility from Kaiser, Kaiser
assumes the defense and liability, subject to a reservation of rights against
Century of West Virginia. The Company believes it is unlikely that existing or
potential plaintiffs were exposed to asbestos at the Century of West Virginia
facility after Century of West Virginia purchased the facility from Kaiser,
although eighteen plaintiffs have claimed they were exposed during this period
of time. Claims with eight of these plaintiffs have been settled for nominal
amounts or dismissed. Therefore, while the impact of the asbestos proceedings is
impossible to predict, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution will
not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition, results
of operations or liquidity.
On November 17, 1996, a suit was brought in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against Century of West
Virginia and Kaiser purportedly on behalf of a proposed class believed to
consist of approximately 150 salaried employees and retirees of Century of West
Virginia. Plaintiffs claim that in 1989 defendants misrepresented the terms of
the salaried employee pension plan and/or benefits. Century of West Virginia has
denied liability and asked the court to deny class certification. On March 2,
1998, the court granted Century of West Virginia motion and denied class
certification. While it is impossible to predict the outcome of this litigation,
Century of West Virginia will continue to defend the matter vigorously, and the
Company believes the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
The Company has pending against it or may be subject to various other
lawsuits, claims and proceedings related primarily to employment, commercial,
environmental and safety and health matters. Although it is not presently
possible to determine the outcome of these matters, management believes their
ultimate disposition will not have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Commitments
The Company and a public utility have signed a power supply agreement,
covering the period from July 1, 1996 through July 31, 2003. This agreement
replaces a power supply agreement with the same utility that was due to expire
in 1998. Billings, under the old agreement, were computed using a formula based
principally upon the utility operating costs. Such billings were decreased if
the London Metals Exchange LME primary ingot price was less than certain
specified levels, and increased, limited to the extent of cumulative net
decreases, if the LME primary ingot price was greater that certain specified
levels. Under the new agreement, the Company will pay a fixed price for
electricity used. However, for the period from July 1, 1996 through July 31,
1998, if the LME primary ingot price were to exceed certain specified levels,
the price for electricity used would increase, to the extent of cumulative net
price decreases under the previous contract with the same utility. The Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio has approved the agreement.
On January 23, 1996, the Company and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation PBGC entered into an agreement the PBGC Agreement which
provided that the Company make a cash contribution of $20,000 to its pension
plan for hourly employees in 1996. The Company made the contributions in 1996.
The PBGC Agreement also provides for scheduled contributions to be made to the
Company pension plan for hourly employees with respect to 1997, 1998 and 1999.
The Company made its scheduled contribution for
40

CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
1997 and estimates that its scheduled contributions in each of the remaining
years will be $7,000 above the minimum required contributions under Section 412
of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has granted the PBGC a first priority
security interest in i the property, plant and equipment at its Century of
West Virginia facility and ii all of the outstanding shares of Berkeley. In
addition, Century must grant the PBGC a first priority security interest in the
first $50,000 of the property, plant and equipment of any business or businesses
that the Company acquires. The Company, in its discretion, may, however,
substitute Berkeley undivided interest in the Mt. Holly Facility in lieu of
any such after-acquired property, plant and equipment as well as the shares of
Berkeley. The PBGC Agreement will terminate if a the Company termination
liabilities under ERISA for its two pension plans are less than $100 million or
b if, after December 31, 2000, the Company has made the payments required by
the PBGC Agreement and i the unsecured debt of the Company is rated BBB- or
better by Standard & Poor and Baa3 or better by Moody, ii the Company has
obtained certain agreed-upon private ratings on a hypothetical issue of
unsecured debt, or iii the Company meets certain financial performance
criteria.
During 1992, the Company established a progress sharing plan the Plan
for eligible union employees. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company created a
progress sharing pool, defined as 10% of Century of West Virginia pre-Plan,
after-tax income as defined of each Plan year through 1997 when the Plan
terminated.
The Company has provided a $27,500 letter of credit to ensure its
performance under the Owners Agreement governing the Mt. Holly Facility. The
Company obligation to maintain the letter of credit will terminate at such
time as the Company achieves certain financial measurements.
See Note 14 for a discussion of the Company fixed-price commitments and
forward contracts.
14. FIXED-PRICE COMMITMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS
The Company produces primary aluminum products and manufactures aluminum
sheet and plate products and manages the risks of each accordingly. The Company
enters into forward primary aluminum contracts to hedge fixed-price purchase and
sale commitments and inventory positions and to cover expected future sales and
to otherwise manage the Company exposure to changing prices.
Pursuant to the foregoing strategy, the Company had fixed price commitments
to sell 3027 million pounds and 4076 million pounds of primary and scrap
aluminum and aluminum sheet and plate products at December 31, 1997 and December
31, 1996, respectively. Forward purchase contracts for approximately 20 million
pounds and 279 million pounds of primary aluminum at December 31, 1997 and
December 31, 1996, respectively, did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment
because the Company aggregate metals position exceeded its fixed-price sales
commitments at such dates. Cost of goods sold includes either a net credit or a
net charge relating to the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts that
did not satisfy the technical requirements for hedge accounting, realized gains
or losses from the cash settlement of forward contracts, unrealized losses on
purchase and sales commitments and reversals of prior period unrealized losses.
The resultant charges were $6,837, $6,670 and $898 for the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. In addition, at December 31, 1997, the
Company had forward sales contracts with Glencore, Ltd. for 100 million pounds
of primary aluminum to hedge 1998 and 1999 production. At December 31, 1996, the
Company had forward sales contracts with Glencore, Ltd. for 116 million pounds
of primary aluminum to hedge 1997 and 1998 production. Accounting standards
require that such contracts be marked to market. As of December 31, 1997 and
1996, the Company deferred unrealized losses of $3,565 and $7,699, respectively,
on such contracts. At December 31, 1997, the Company had fixed price commitments
to purchase 107 million pounds of primary and scrap aluminum.
During 1994, the Company entered into a forward purchase contract for 120
million pounds of primary aluminum with Glencore to cover a portion of its 1995
sheet and plate product sales. During the year ended
41
42
CENTURY ALUMINUM COMPANY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1996 AND 1995
December 31, 1995, the Company entered into forward sales contracts with
Glencore which had the effect of offsetting the metal it was obligated to
acquire under the forward purchase contract. For the year ended December 31,
1995, the Company recognized net gains of $9,616 related to these contracts.
Although the Company has not materially participated in the purchase of
call options, in cases where Century sells forward primary aluminum, it may
purchase call options to preserve the opportunity to benefit from price
increases significantly above the forward sales prices. In addition, in cases
where the Company purchases forward primary aluminum, it may purchase put
options to protect itself from price decreases.
Concurrent with the sale of Vialco see Note 12, the Company entered into
a long-term supply agreement for 936 million pounds of alumina annually,
beginning January 1, 1996. Century will pay a fixed price for alumina with fixed
annual price increases of approximately 25% through 2001. Pricing for the years
2002 through 2006 will be subject to agreement between the parties.
15. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The related party transactions occurring during the years ended December
31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, and not discussed elsewhere in the notes to the
consolidated financial statements,are described below.
Related Party Transactions -- Century
During the years 1996 and 1997 and at December 31, 1997, the Chairman of
the Board of Directors of Century was a member of the Board of Directors of
Glencore International AG. Prior to March 28, 1996, he was also an officer of
Glencore. In addition, during the year ended and at December 31, 1997, one of
Century Board members was employed by Glencore International AG.
Related Party Transactions -- Century of West Virginia
During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, Century of West
Virginia purchased alumina and bought and sold primary and scrap aluminum in
transactions with Glencore Ltd. at prices which management believes approximates
market.
During the year ended December 31, 1995, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors of Century of West Virginia and other Board members were employed by
Glencore AG. An allocation of Glencore AG expenses in the amount of $750 has
been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These
expenses have been allocated by assessing incremental amounts of such expenses
not previously charged to the Company. Management believes that such expense
allocation is reasonable. In addition, pursuant to a consulting agreement,
Glencore Ltd. provided certain management services during 1995 to Century of
West Virginia at a charge of approximately $150.
Related Party Transactions -- Berkeley
A substantial portion of Berkeley sales during the years ended December
31, 1997 and 1996 were to Glencore Ltd. Prior to 1996, Berkeley derived all of
its net sales from tolling agreements with Glencore Ltd. The conversion price
charged to Glencore Ltd., under these tolling agreements, was based on a
percentage of the prior quarter daily average settlement price for aluminum
ingot on the LME. Berkeley also charged Glencore Ltd. an additional amount for
costs incurred relating to the production of premium product, as defined in
the tolling agreements, and certain other related costs.
Effective January 1, 1996, and for the term of one year, the Company
entered into the Services and Marketing Agreement with Glencore Ltd. pursuant to
which Glencore Ltd. furnished training and marketing assistance in connection
with Century ownership of the Mt. Holly Facility. In addition, prior to
January 1,
