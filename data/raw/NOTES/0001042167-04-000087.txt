No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. 16 Part II Item 5. Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company management, including the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the Company disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in the Company periodic filings with theCommission. It should be noted that in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has designed its disclosure controls and procedures to reach a level of reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and based on the evaluation described above, the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company disclosure controls and procedures were effective at reaching that level of reasonable assurance.
There was no change in the Company internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended during the Company most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company internal control over financial reporting. 28 Part III
