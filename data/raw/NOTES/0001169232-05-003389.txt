Item 4A. Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of April 1, 2005, and, based on their
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these controls
and procedures are effective. 
During the fiscal quarter ended April 1, 2005 there were no significant changes in the Companys
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to
the date of their evaluation.
Disclosure controls and procedures are the Companys controls and other procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that the Company files or
submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 26 PART III
