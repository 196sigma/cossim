PRG-Schultz International, Inc.
Atlanta, Georgia We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2008 and 2007 and the related consolidated statements
of operations, shareholders equity deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2008. In connection with our audits of the financial statements, we have
also audited the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index. These consolidated
financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and
schedule. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. As discussed in Note 1i to the consolidated financial statements, Income Taxes, the Company has
changed its method for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions in 2007 due to the
adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 45 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES aDescription of Business and Basis of Presentation Description of Business The principal business of PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company is
providing recovery audit services to large businesses and government agencies having numerous
payment transactions. These businesses include, but are not limited to   
retailers such as discount, department, specialty, grocery and drug stores, and
wholesalers who sell to these retailers   
business enterprises other than retailers/wholesalers such as automobile and aerospace
manufacturers, financial services firms, pharmaceutical companies, and healthcare payors   
federal and state government agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services CMS. The Company currently provides services to clients in over 25 countries. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Financial statements for all years presented separately report results
of discontinued operations from results of continuing operations see Note 2. Disclosures included
herein pertain to the Companys continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the
reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to
prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates. bReverse Stock Split At the annual meeting of shareholders held on August11, 2006, the shareholders of the Company
approved a proposal granting authorization to effect a reverse stock split of the Companys common
stock at a ratio of one-for-ten. The one-for-ten reverse stock split became effective on August14,
2006. All common stock and per share data for all periods presented in these financial statements
have been restated to give effect to the reverse stock split. In connection with the reverse stock
split, the number of shares subject to outstanding options and the option exercise prices were
automatically proportionately adjusted in accordance with the terms of the grants. cRevenue Recognition The Companys revenues are based on specific contracts with its clients. Such contracts
generally specify: atime periods covered by the audit; bnature and extent of audit services
to be provided by the Company; cthe clients duties in assisting and cooperating with the
Company; and dfees payable to the Company, generally expressed as a specified percentage of the
amounts recovered by the client resulting from overpayment claims identified. Clients generally
recover claims by either taking credits against outstanding payables or future purchases from the
involved vendors, or receiving refund checks directly from those vendors. The manner in which a
claim is recovered by a client is often dictated by industry practice. In addition, many clients
establish specific procedural guidelines that the Company must satisfy prior to submitting claims
for client approval, and they are unique to each client. For some services provided by the Company,
compensation is in the form of a flat fee, a fee per hour, or a fee per other unit of service. 46 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company generally recognizes revenue on the accrual basis except with respect to certain
International Accounts Payable Services units. Revenue is generally recognized for a contractually
specified percentage of amounts recovered when it has been determined that the Companys clients
have received economic value generally through credits taken against existing accounts payable due
to the involved vendors or refund checks received from those vendors and when the following
criteria are met: apersuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; bservices have been
rendered; cthe fee billed to the client is fixed or determinable and dcollectibility is
reasonably assured. In certain limited circumstances, the Company will invoice a client prior to
meeting all four of these criteria; in such cases, revenue is deferred until all of the criteria
are met. Additionally, for purposes of determining appropriate timing of recognition and for
internal control purposes, the Company relies on customary business practices and processes for
documenting that the criteria described in athrough dabove, have been met. Such customary
business practices and processes may vary significantly by client. On occasion, it is possible that
a transaction has met all of the revenue recognition criteria described above but revenue is not
recognized, unless management can otherwise determine that criteria athrough dabove have been
met, because the Companys customary business practices and processes specific to that client have
not been completed. Historically, there has been a certain amount of revenue with respect to which, even though
the requirements of the Companys revenue recognition policy were met, the Companys customers
vendors have ultimately rejected the claims underlying the revenue. In that case, the Companys
customers, even though fees may have been collected by the Company, may request a refund or offset
of such amount. The Company records such refunds as a reduction of revenue. Refund liabilities are
provided for these reductions in the economic value previously received by the Companys clients
with respect to vendor claims identified by the Company and for which the Company has previously
recognized revenue. The Company computes the estimate of its refund liabilities at any given time
based on actual historical refund data. During the first quarter of 2008, management revised its estimation of expected refund rates
in its Domestic Accounts Payable Services segment. Such change in estimate resulted from a decline
in actual Domestic Accounts Payable Services refund rates observed during 2007. The impact of the
change in estimate resulted in a $08million increase in first quarter 2008 income from continuing
operations. During the fourth quarter of 2008, management changed its method of estimating the
refund liability related to its International Accounts Payable Services segment to be more
consistent with the methodology used in the Domestic Accounts Payable Services segment. The impact
of the change in estimate resulted in a $09million decrease in fourth quarter 2008 income from
continuing operations. The combined impact of the 2008 refund liability estimate changes was to
decrease income from continuing operations by $01million, or less than $001 per basic and
diluted share. Management does not expect that these changes in estimate will have a material
impact on future period results. Unbilled receivables are usually contractual and relate to claims for which clients have
received economic value. Unbilled receivables arise when a portion of the Companys fee is deferred
at the time of the initial invoice. At a later date which can be up to a year after original
invoice, and at other times a year after completion of the audit period, the unbilled receivable
amount is invoiced. Both the Company and the client acknowledge that this unbilled receivable has
been earned at the time of the original invoice, it just has a deferred due date. Periodic changes in unbilled receivables and refund liabilities are recorded as adjustments to
revenue. The Company derives a relatively small portion of revenues on a fee-for-service basis
whereby billing is based upon a flat fee, a fee per hour, or a fee per other unit of service. The
Company recognizes revenue for these types of services as they are provided and invoiced, and when
criteria athrough das set forth above are met. dCash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an
initial maturity of three months or less. The Company places its temporary cash investments with
high credit quality financial institutions. At times, certain investments may be in excess of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit. At December31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $267million and
$424million, respectively, of which cash equivalents represent approximately $233million and
$370million 47 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS respectively. The Company had $185million and $367million in cash equivalents at U.S.
banks at December31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At December31, 2008 and 2007, certain of the
Companys international subsidiaries held $48million and $03million, respectively, in temporary
investments, the majority of which were at banks in Canada and Latin America. eProperty and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer and other equipment,
five years for furniture and fixtures and three years for purchased software. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or ten
years. The Company evaluates property and equipment for impairment in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets SFAS No144. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No144, the Company
reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the
estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases
where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss
equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets is recognized. fInternally Developed Software The Company accounts for software developed for internal use in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal
Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 provides guidance on a variety of issues relating to costs of internal
use software, including which of these costs should be capitalized and which should be expensed as
incurred. Internally developed software is amortized using the straight-line method over the
expected useful lives of three to seven years. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No144, the Company reviews the carrying value of
internally developed software for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted expected future cash
flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss equal to an amount by which the carrying
value exceeds the fair value of assets is recognized. gGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of
net assets of acquired businesses. The Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in
accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142. SFAS No142
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but
instead be tested for impairment at least annually. This Statement also requires that intangible
assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and
reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No144. Management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets annually, or
more frequently if events or changes in circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings or cash
flows or material adverse changes in the business climate indicate that the carrying value of an
asset might be impaired. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a
reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company uses independent business valuation
professionals for the purpose of estimating fair value. During the third quarter of 2007, management re-evaluated its policy related to the
amortization of its customer relationships intangible asset. The customer relationships intangible
asset had been amortized since its acquisition in 2002 using the straight-line method over a twenty
year expected life. Managements re-evaluation concluded that the original twenty year life
continued to be a reasonable expectation. However, because of the expectation that revenues and
profits from these customers will likely decline in future years, management concluded that an
accelerated method of amortization of the customer relationships intangible asset would be more
appropriate. The accelerated method results in amortization of the net unamortized June30, 2007
balance 48 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
over the remaining 145year life at a rate that declines at approximately 8% per year. The Company
adopted the new method in the third quarter of 2007 and the resulting change in amortization is
being accounted for on a prospective basis in accordance with SFAS No142. Amortization expense in
2007 was increased by $05million as a result of the change in method. hDirect Expenses Direct expenses incurred during the course of accounts payable audits and other recovery audit
services are typically expensed as incurred. Commission costs related to deferred revenues are
deferred until revenue is recognized. iIncome Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS No109, requires that a valuation
allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax
asset will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are
deductible. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative
evidence affecting specific deferred tax assets, including the Companys past and anticipated
future performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of tax planning
strategies. Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation
allowance is not needed for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets when significant negative
evidence exists. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48 Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN No48
prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The Interpretation also offers guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. In accordance with FIN
No48, paragraph 19, the Companys policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax
positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes. As a result of the 2007
implementation of FIN No48, the Company recognized a $03million increase in liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007
accumulated deficit balance. jForeign Currency The local currency has been used as the functional currency in the majority of the countries
in which the Company conducts business outside of the United States. The assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rates of exchange
at the balance sheet date. The translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of
shareholders equity deficitand are included in the determination of comprehensive income
loss. Comprehensive income lossfor the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 included
translation gains lossesrelated to long-term intercompany balances of $07million, $01
million and $01million, respectively. Revenues and expenses in foreign currencies are translated
at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. All realized and unrealized foreign currency
transaction gains and losses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. For the
years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, foreign currency transaction gains lossesincluded
in continuing results of operations were $15million, $16million, $08million, respectively. kEarnings Per Common Share 49 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per
common share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
common share is principally computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by
the sum of 1the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period,
2the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method,
and 3the dilutive effect of other potentially dilutive securities, including the Companys
convertible note obligations and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. The
potential dilutive effect of stock options and convertible instruments is excluded from the
determination of diluted earnings per share if the effect would be antidilutive. lStock-Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the requirements of SFAS
No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS No123R. SFAS No123R requires that companies
account for awards of equity instruments issued to employees under the fair value method of
accounting and recognize such amounts in their statements of operations. The Company adopted SFAS
No123R on January1, 2006. Under SFAS No123R, the Company is required to measure
compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize
compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations over the service period over
which the awards are expected to vest. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the
indicated vesting periods using the straight-line method. The Company recognizes compensation costs
for awards with performance conditions based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions.
Compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved
and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. The fair value of all time-vested options is estimated as of the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for
use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. The fair value of market condition options also known as path-dependent options may
be estimated as of their date of grant using more complex option valuation models such as binomial
lattice and Monte Carlo simulations. The Company chose to use the Monte Carlo simulation method for
its valuations of market condition options. Option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Companys
employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options
and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value
estimate, it is managements opinion that existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of the Companys employee stock options. For time-vested option grants made in 2008, 2007 and 2006 which resulted in compensation
expense recognition, the Company used the following assumptions in its Black-Scholes valuation
models

5years The Company estimates the fair value of awards of restricted shares and nonvested shares, as
defined in SFAS 123R, as being equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of the
award. Also, under SFAS 123R, companies must classify their share-based payments as either
liability-classified awards or as equity-classified awards. Liability-classified awards are
remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled. Equity-classified
awards are measured at grant date fair value and are not subsequently remeasured. The Company has
classified its share-based payments which are settled in Company common stock as equity-classified
awards and its share-based payments that are settled in cash as liability-classified awards.
Compensation costs related to equity-classified awards are generally equal to the fair value of the
award at grant-date amortized over the vesting period of the award. The liability for
liability-classified awards is generally equal to the fair value of the award as of the balance
sheet date times the percentage vested at the time. The change in the liability amount from one
balance sheet date to another is charged or credited to compensation cost. 50 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
mComprehensive Income Loss The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. This
Statement establishes items that are required to be recognized under accounting standards as
components of comprehensive income loss. Consolidated comprehensive income lossfor the Company
consists of consolidated net earnings lossand foreign currency translation, and is presented in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity Deficit. nSegment Reporting The Company reports its operating segment information in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS No.
131. SFAS No131 requires, among other provisions, that the Company disclose the measure of
profit or loss for each reportable segment that is reported to and used by the chief operating
decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and assessing
performance. Management of the Company, including the chief operating decision maker, uses what is
internally referred to as Adjusted EBITDA as its primary measure of profit or loss for purposes
of assessing the operating performance of all operating segments. Adjusted EBITDA is earnings from
continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization EBITDA as adjusted
for unusual and other significant items that management views as distorting the operating results
of the various segments from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not computed or presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures do not measure the profit or loss
of the reportable segments in accordance with GAAP. SFAS No131 requires such non-GAAP measures of
profit or loss to be reported if such measures are what are reported to and used by the Companys
chief operating decision maker. SFAS No131 also requires that the total of the reportable
segments measures of profit or loss be reconciled to the Companys operating results presented on
a GAAP basis. Such reconciliation is provided in Note 5 to these consolidated financial statements
along with other information about the Companys reportable segments. The reconciling items are not
intended to be, nor should they be, interpreted as non-recurring or extraordinary, or in any manner
be deemed as adjustments made in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial
measure determined in accordance with GAAP, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled
measures of other companies. oNew Accounting Standards SFAS No141R. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business
Combinations SFAS No141R. SFAS No141R establishes principles and requirements for how
the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired,
the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; recognizes and measures
the goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; determines what
information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and
financial effects of a business combination; and requires that costs associated with business
combinations be expensed as incurred. SFAS No141R is effective as of the beginning of an
entitys first fiscal year that begins after December15, 2008. The Company has not determined the
impact, if any, SFAS No141R will have on its future financial statements. SFAS No157. In September2006, the FASB issued SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurements
SFAS No157. SFAS No157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value. Level 1: quoted price unadjustedin active markets for identical assets Level 2: inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the instrument 51 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Level 3: inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable for the asset or liability SFAS No157 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Relative to SFAS No157, the FASB issued FASB Staff Positions FSP 157-1 and 157-2. FSP
157-1 amends SFAS No157 to exclude SFAS No13, Accounting for Leases, and its related
interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions, while FSP 157-2 delays
the effective date of the application of SFAS No157 to fiscal years beginning after November15,
2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The Company adopted SFAS No157 as of January1, 2008, with the exception of the application
of the statement to non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. Non-recurring
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the Company has not applied the
provisions of SFAS No157 include those measured at fair value in goodwill and other intangible
assets impairment testing. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of
December31, 2008 and 2007 included cash equivalents of
$233million and $370million,
respectively, which were valued based on Level 1 inputs and debt and capital lease obligations of
$196million and $459million, respectively, which were valued based on Level 2 inputs. The
Company did not have any assets valued based on Level 3 inputs. SFAS No159. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an amendment of FASB Statement No115
SFAS No159. This standard permits an entity to choose to measure certain financial assets and
liabilities at fair value. SFAS No159 also revises provisions of SFAS No115 that apply to
available-for-sale and trading securities. This statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2007. The adoption by the Company of SFAS No159 effective January1, 2008 did
not have any material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS No160. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No160, Noncontrolling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements SFAS No160. SFAS No160 establishes new accounting and
reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of
a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest
minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the
parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be
included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. SFAS No160 clarifies
that changes in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation
are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this
statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is
deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling
equity investment on the deconsolidation date. SFAS No160 also includes expanded disclosure
requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest. SFAS No160 is
effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited.
The Company has determined that under its present structure, the adoption of SFAS No160 will not
have a material impact on its future financial statements. SFAS No161. In March2008, the FASB issued SFAS No161, Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No133 SFAS 161, which
requires additional disclosures about the objectives of derivative instruments and hedging
activities, the method of accounting for such instruments under SFAS No133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations, and a tabular
disclosure of the effects of such instruments and related hedged items on the companys financial
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No161 is effective prospectively for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November15, 2008,
with early application encouraged. SFAS No161 encourages, but does not require, comparative
disclosures for periods prior to its initial adoption. The Company will adopt SFAS No161 on
January1, 2009 and is currently evaluating the potential impact on its financial statements when
implemented. 52 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FSP APB 14-1. In May2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No.APB 14-1, Accounting for
Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion Including Partial Cash
Settlement FSP APB 14-1. FSP APB 14-1 requires that the liability and equity components of convertible debt
instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be
separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate.
The resulting debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be
outstanding as additional non-cash interest expense. FSP APB 14-1 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The provisions of FSP APB 14-1 are required to be applied retrospectively to
all periods presented. The Company is required to adopt FSP APB 14-1 beginning in the first quarter
of 2009. The Company has not determined the impact, if any, FSP APB 14-1 will have on its future
financial statements. 2DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On May30, 2007, the Company sold its Meridian VAT reclaim business Meridian to Averio
Holdings Limited, a Dublin, Ireland based company affiliated with management of Meridian
Averio. The Company received proceeds from the sale of approximately $224million at closing
and an additional $22million on December31, 2007. The Company recognized a 2007 gain on sale of
approximately $199million as a result of the transaction. On January11, 2006, the Companys Channel Revenue business was sold for $04million in cash
to Outsource Recovery, Inc. The Company recognized a 2006 gain on sale of $03million related to
the sale of the Channel Revenue business. On July17, 2006, the Company completed the sale of its
Airline business to a former employee. During 2006, the Company recognized a loss of $03million
relating to the sale of the Airline business unit. On October30, 2001, the Company consummated the sale of its Logistics Management Services
business to Platinum Equity. In addition to the initial proceeds, the sale agreement provided for
additional sale proceeds payable in the form of a revenue-based royalty over four years. During
2006, the Company recognized additional gains on the sale of discontinued operations of $03
million related to the receipt of the final portions of the revenue-based royalty from the sale. The net tax effects on gains losseson sales of discontinued operations were not significant
in 2008, 2007 and 2006. The Meridian gain did not result in the recognition of significant tax
expense due to it being recognized in a tax-favored jurisdiction. The following table summarizes
the net gains lossesfrom the sales of discontinued operations for the three years ended December

3RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS The July31, 2005 retirements of the Companys former Chairman, President and CEO, John M.
Cook, and the Companys former Vice Chairman, John M. Toma, resulted in an obligation to pay
retirement benefits of $76million to be paid in monthly cash installments principally over a
three-year period, beginning February1, 2006. On March16, 2006, the terms of the applicable
severance agreements were amended in conjunction with the Companys financial restructuring.
Pursuant to the terms of the severance agreements, as amended 1the Companys obligations to pay
monthly cash installments to Mr.Cook and Mr.Toma were extended from 36months to 58months and
from 24months to 46months, respectively; however, the total dollar amount of monthly cash
payments to be made to each remained unchanged, and 2the Company agreed to pay a fixed sum of
$150,000 to defray the fees and expenses of the legal counsel and financial advisors to Messrs.
Cook and Toma. The original severance agreements, and the severance agreements, as amended, also
provide for an annual reimbursement, beginning on or about February1, 2007, to Mr.Cook and Mr.
Toma for the cost of health insurance for themselves and their respective spouses not to exceed
$25,000 and $20,000, respectively, subject to adjustment based on changes in the Consumer Price
Index, continuing until each reaches the age of 80. At December31, 2008, the Companys accrued
payroll and related expenses and noncurrent compensation obligations include $14million and $19
million, respectively, related to these obligations. 4MAJOR CLIENTS For the year ended December31, 2008, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and its affiliated companies
accounted for approximately 112% of total revenues from continuing operations. The Company did not

6EARNINGS LOSSPER COMMON SHARE The following tables set forth the computations of basic and diluted earnings lossper
common share for the three years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 in thousands, except per
share data. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, the impact of all potentially dilutive
securities is antidilutive, thus diluted weighted average common shares and diluted earnings loss
per common share presented are the same as basic weighted average common shares and basic earnings

For the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, options to purchase 10million shares,
10million shares and 05million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings lossper common share due to their antidilutive effect as the
options exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares during the
periods. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, common shares of 14million and 05
million underlying Performance Units Note 14 outstanding, respectively, were excluded from the
computation of diluted earnings lossper common share due to their antidilutive effect to
earnings lossper common share from continuing operations. In 2006, all potentially dilutive common shares underlying the Companys convertible
securities which were outstanding during those periods were excluded from the computation of
diluted earnings lossper common share due to their antidilutive effect. No such convertible
securities were outstanding at December31, 2008 and 2007. 58 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

7GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS aGoodwill SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No142, requires that goodwill
and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead be tested for
impairment at least annually. The Company has selected October1, the first day of its fourth
quarter, as its annual assessment date. SFAS No142 requires that the Company perform goodwill
impairment testing using a prescribed two-step, fair value approach. During each of the fourth quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company performed the required
annual impairment testing of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142. As a result of these tests,
the Company concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill as of those dates. All of the goodwill balances for all periods presented relate to the Companys Domestic
Accounts Payable Services segment. bOther Intangible Assets The Companys other intangible assets were acquired as part of the January24, 2002
acquisitions of the businesses of Howard Schultz Associates International, Inc. and affiliates.

The provisions of SFAS No142 require that the Company review the carrying value of
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or whenever events and
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the
estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. At
the time of adoption, the Company selected October1, the first day of its fourth quarter, as its
annual assessment date. During each of the fourth quarters of 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company performed the required
annual impairment testing of its trade name in accordance with SFAS No142. As a result of these
tests, the Company concluded that there was no impairment of its trade name as of those dates. During the third quarter of 2007, management re-evaluated its policy related to the
amortization of its customer relationships intangible asset. The customer relationships intangible
asset had been amortized since its acquisition in 2002 using the straight-line method over a twenty
year expected life. Managements re-evaluation concluded that the original twenty year life
continued to be a reasonable expectation. However, because of the expectation that revenues and
profits from these customers will likely decline in future years, management concluded that an
accelerated method of amortization of the customer relationships intangible asset would be more
appropriate. The accelerated method results in amortization of the net unamortized June30, 2007
balance over the remaining 145year life at a rate that declines at approximately 8% per year. The
Company adopted the new method in the third quarter of 2007 and the resulting change in
amortization is being accounted for on a prospective basis in accordance with SFAS No142.
Amortization expense in 2007 was increased by $05million $004 per weighted-average common
share as a result of the change in method. Amortization of intangible assets 59 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
amounted to $22million, $19million and $14million per year for the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Based on the current amortization method, intangible asset
amortization expense for each consecutive year for the next five
years will be $20 million, $19
million, $17 million, $16 million and $15 million, respectively. 8DEBT, CAPITAL LEASES AND MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK 2006 Financial Restructuring On March17, 2006, the Company completed an exchange offer the Exchange Offer for its $125
million of 475% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2006 the Convertible Subordinated Notes. As
a result of the Exchange Offer, substantially all of the outstanding Convertible Subordinated Notes
and accrued interest thereon were exchanged for a $515million in principal amount of 110%
Senior Notes Due 2011, b $596million in principal amount of 100% Senior Convertible Notes Due
2011, and c124,094 shares, or $149million liquidation preference, of 90% SeriesA Convertible
Participating Preferred Stock. The $09million of Convertible Subordinated Notes that were not
exchanged were redeemed in November2006. The new instruments issued in the exchange were initially recorded at their estimated fair

The aggregate fair value of the new instruments issued exceeded the book value of the
exchanged Convertible Subordinated Notes by approximately $10million. Such amount was recognized
as a loss on financial restructuring in the first quarter of 2006. The Company incurred $13
million of costs related to the issuance of the new preferred stock. Such amount was charged to
additional paid-in capital in the first quarter of 2006. The Company incurred costs of $51million
in connection with the issuance of the new senior notes and senior convertible notes. Such amount
was capitalized and was being amortized over the term of the notes. The excess of the fair value of the preferred stock over its stated liquidation redemption
value was credited to additional paid-in capital. The excess of the principal balance of the new
senior notes over their fair value was recorded as a note discount and was being amortized on the
interest method over the term of the notes. The excess of the fair value of the new senior
convertible notes over their principal balance was recorded as a note premium and was being
amortized on the interest method over the term of the notes. As a part of its financial restructuring in March2006, the Company entered into a senior
secured credit facility with Ableco LLC Ableco and The CIT/Group/Business Credit, Inc. The
credit facility included 1a $250million term loan, and 2a revolving credit facility that
provided for revolving loan borrowings of up to $200million. The Company incurred $26million of
costs in connection with entering into the senior secured credit facility. Such amount was
capitalized and was being amortized over the term of the indebtedness. 60 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On September15, 2006, the Company issued $29million of additional senior convertible notes
in lieu of the semiannual cash interest payment thereon. As of December31, 2006, 37,030 shares of
SeriesA convertible preferred stock had been converted into 1,618,995 shares of common stock. 2007 Repayments, Conversions, Redemptions and New Credit Facility During the first quarter of 2007, the Company repaid $96million of the $25million Ableco
term loan. During the second quarter of 2007, the Company repaid the remaining $154million
balance of the term loan with a portion of the proceeds of the Meridian sale. In September2007, the Company initiated the redemption of all of the then outstanding 11%
senior notes, 10% senior convertible notes and 9% SeriesA convertible preferred stock. In
September2007, the Company also entered into an amended and restated credit facility with Ableco
consisting of a $20million revolving credit facility and a $45million term loan which was funded
in October2007. During 2007, prior to redemption, 86,744 shares of SeriesA convertible preferred stock were
converted into 4,098,541 shares of common stock and $624million in principal value of the 10%
senior convertible notes were converted into 9,593,779 shares of common stock. In addition, during
October2007, the $515million in principal value of 11% senior notes were fully redeemed, along
with a $10million prepayment premium. The remaining outstanding 10% senior convertible notes and
9% SeriesA convertible preferred stock which totaled less than $02million were also redeemed.
The redemptions were funded with a portion of the Companys unrestricted funds and the proceeds of
the Ableco $45million term loan. The face amount of the 11% senior notes redeemed exceeded their carrying amount net of
unamortized discount and deferred loan costs by $84million. Such amount, along with the $10
million prepayment premium, $94million in total, is reported as a loss on debt extinguishment in
the 2007 Consolidated Statement of Operations. Unamortized deferred loan costs of $21million
related to the senior convertible notes that were converted to common shares were charged to
additional paid-in capital in 2007. Activity related to the senior notes and senior convertible notes during the two years ended

As a consequence of the early repayment of the $25million Ableco term loan in 2007 and the
replacement of the revolving credit facility, the Company wrote-off $17million of unamortized
deferred loan costs in 2007. Such amount is included in 2007 interest expense. The Company incurred
approximately $31million of costs in connection with its entry in September2007 into the amended
and restated Ableco credit facility. Such amount has been capitalized and is being amortized over
the life of the facility. 2008 Repayments During 2008, the Company reduced the balance of the Ableco term loan by $259million. This
amount included $109million of mandatory payments, including contingent payments see below, as
well as a voluntary prepayment of $150million. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company
completed an amendment of its credit facility, permitting the $150million pre-payment without
penalty and increasing the initial borrowing capacity under the revolver portion of the facility by $10
million. The additional borrowing capacity is reduced over the term
of the credit facility and availability is based on eligible accounts
receivable and other factors. Availability under the revolver at
December31, 2008 was $225million. The principal portion of the term loan must be repaid in quarterly installments of $125
million each commencing in April2008. The loan agreement also requires an annual additional
prepayment contingently payable based on an excess cash flow calculation as defined in the
agreement. The first such payment was made in April2008. The Company does not expect that a 2009
contingent payment will be required due to the $15million voluntary payment made in 2008. The
remaining balance of the term loan is due in September2011. Interest is payable monthly and
accrues at the Companys option at either prime plus 20% or at LIBOR plus 475%, but under either
option may not be less than 975%. Interest on outstanding balances under the revolving credit
facility, if any, will accrue at the Companys option at either prime plus 025% or at LIBOR plus
225%. The Company must also pay a commitment fee of 05% per annum, payable monthly, on the unused
portion of the $225million revolving credit facility. As of December31, 2008, there were no
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. The
weighted-average interest rates on term loan balances outstanding
under the credit facility during 2008 and 2007, including fees, were
109% and 103%, respectively. The credit facility is guaranteed by
each of the Companys direct and indirect domestic wholly owned subsidiaries and certain of its
foreign subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the Companys assets including the
stock of the Companys domestic subsidiaries and two-thirds of the stock of certain of the
Companys foreign subsidiaries. The credit facility will mature on September17, 2011. Capital Lease Obligation In November2006, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement for the use of copier
equipment to be used throughout its domestic locations. The agreement requires 36monthly payments
which began November1, 2007. Payments over the four year life of the agreement aggregate $11
million. The present value of payments remaining as of December31, 2008 is $06million using an
imputed interest rate of 113%. 62 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Rent expense, excluding costs associated with the termination of noncancelable lease arrangements,
for 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $69million, $80million and $95million, respectively. SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS No.
146, requires that a liability for costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term be
recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity terminates the contract in accordance
with the contract terms. The Company incurred approximately $12million and $14million in 2007
and 2006, respectively, in termination costs of noncancelable lease arrangements. The Company
recognized a corresponding liability for the fair value of the remaining lease rentals, reduced by
any estimable sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the properties. This liability
is reduced ratably over the remaining term of the cancelled lease arrangements as cash payments are
made. Accretion related to discounting is included in rent expense. The Company has entered into several operating lease agreements that contain provisions for
future rent increases, free rent periods or periods in which rent payments are reduced abated. In
accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No85-3, Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled
Rent Increases, the total amount of rental payments due over the lease term is being charged to
rent expense on the straight-line, undiscounted method over the lease terms. In November2006, the Company entered into a capital lease agreement for the use of copier
equipment to be used throughout its domestic locations. The agreement requires 36monthly payments
beginning November1, 2007. The future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating and capital leases are

SFAS No109 requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable
income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. In making this
determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific
deferred tax assets, including the Companys past and anticipated future performance, the reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, the length of carry-back and carry-forward periods and the
implementation of tax planning strategies. Objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is
not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists.
Cumulative losses in recent years are the most compelling form of negative evidence considered by
management in this determination. For the year ended December31, 2008, management has determined
that based on all available evidence, a valuation allowance of $643million is appropriate, as
compared to a valuation allowance in the amount of $798million as of the year ended December31,
2007. 65 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As of December31, 2008, the Company had approximately $428million of U.S. federal loss
carry-forwards available to reduce future taxable income. The loss carry-forwards expire through
2028. On March17, 2006, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined under Section382 of
the Internal Revenue Code IRC. This ownership change resulted in an annual IRC Section382
limitation that mathematically limits the use of certain tax attribute carry-forwards. Of the $428
million of U.S. federal loss carry-forwards available to the Company, $233million of the loss
carry-forwards are subject to an annual usage limitation of $14million. The ownership change that
took place in March2006, resulted in the write-off of approximately $726million in previously
incurred and unexpired federal net operating loss carry-forward amounts and the write-off of
approximately $74million in future tax deductions related to certain built-in losses associated
with intangible and fixed assets. The following write-offs also took place in 2006 as a result of
the ownership change: $341million in unexpired capital loss carry-forwards, $143million in
unexpired foreign tax credit carry-forwards, and $02million in unexpired RD credit carry-forward
amounts. Approximately $1919million of previously incurred and unexpired state net operating
losses were also written off as a result of this ownership change. The write-off of the tax
attributes noted above resulted in a $628million reduction in the Companys deferred tax assets
which was offset by a corresponding reduction in the previously established valuation allowance
against these assets for the year ended December31, 2006. During 2008, the Company acceded to a position taken by the taxing authorities in the United
Kingdom UK regarding the denial of certain goodwill deductions taken on UK tax returns for 2003
through 2005. As a result, foreign net operating loss carry-forwards were reduced by approximately
$170million based on December31, 2008 foreign exchange rates. Accordingly, deferred tax assets
of $51million were written off. This reduction in the Companys deferred tax assets was offset
by a corresponding reduction in the previously established valuation allowance against these
assets. Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48 Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No109 FIN No48
prescribes a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. The Interpretation also offers guidance on derecognition, classification, interest
and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. In accordance with FIN
No48, paragraph 19, the Companys policy for recording interest and penalties associated with tax
positions is to record such items as a component of income before taxes. As a result of the 2007
implementation of FIN No48, the Company recognized a $03million increase in liability for
unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an increase to the January1, 2007
accumulated deficit balance. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

The Company recognized interest expense of $03million related to the liability for unrecognized
tax benefits in each of the two years ended December31, 2008 and 2007. The interest expense
associated with the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is included as a component of income
before taxes. The Company had approximately $12million and $09million accrued for the payment
of interest related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2008, and
2007, respectively. The Company files U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying
statutes of limitations. As of December31, 2008, the 2005 through 2008 tax years generally remain
subject to examination 66 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS by federal and most state and foreign tax authorities. The use of net operating losses
generated in tax years prior to 2005 may also subject returns for those years to examination. 11EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains a 401k Plan in accordance with Section 401k of the Internal Revenue
Code, which allows eligible participating employees to defer receipt of up to 60% of their
compensation and contribute such amount to one or more investment funds. Employee contributions are
matched by the Company in a discretionary amount to be determined by the Company each plan year up
to $3,000 per participant. The Company may also make additional discretionary contributions to the
Plan as determined by the Company each plan year. Company matching funds and discretionary
contributions vest at the rate of 20% each year beginning after the participants first year of
service. Company contributions for continuing and discontinued operations were approximately $10
million in 2008, $08million in 2007 and $12million in 2006. The Company also maintained deferred compensation arrangements for certain key officers and
executives. Total expense related to these deferred compensation arrangements was less than $01
million in 2007 and approximately $01million in 2006. Net payments related to these deferred
compensation arrangements were approximately $09million and $07million in 2007 and 2006,
respectively. As of December31, 2008, there were no remaining balances related to these deferred
compensation arrangements. 12SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN On August1, 2000, the Board authorized a shareholder protection rights plan designed to
protect Company shareholders from coercive or unfair takeover techniques through the use of a
Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement approved by the Board the Rights Plan. The terms of the
Rights Plan, as amended, provide for a dividend of one right collectively, the Rights to
purchase a fraction of a share of participating preferred stock for each share owned. This dividend
was declared for each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on August14,
2000. The Rights, which expire on August14, 2010, may be exercised only if certain conditions are
met, such as the acquisition or the announcement of a tender offer, the consummation of which
would result in the acquisition of 15% or more of the Companys common stock by a person or
affiliated group in a transaction that is not approved by the Board. Issuance of the Rights does
not affect the finances of the Company, interfere with the Companys operations or business plans,
or affect earnings per share. The dividend was not taxable to the Company or its shareholders and
did not change the way in which the Companys shares may be traded. Effective July31, 2000, in connection with the Rights Plan, the Board amended the Companys
Articles of Incorporation to establish a new class of stock, the participating preferred stock. The
Companys remaining, undesignated preferred stock 1million shares authorized as of December31,
2008 may be issued at any time or from time to time in one or more series with such designations,
powers, preferences, rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions including dividend,
conversion and voting rights as may be determined by the Board, without any further votes or
action by the shareholders. 13COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES aLegal Proceedings On April1, 2003, Fleming Companies, one of the Companys larger U.S. Accounts Payable
Services clients at the time filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy reorganization. During the quarter
ended March31, 2003, the Company received approximately $56million in payments on account from
Fleming. On January24, 2005, the Company received a demand from the Fleming Post Confirmation
Trust PCT, a trust which was created pursuant to Flemings Chapter11 reorganization plan to
represent the client, for preference payments received by the Company. The demand stated that the
PCTs calculation of the preference payments was approximately $29 67 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS million. The Company disputed the claim. Later in 2005, the PCT filed suit against the
Company seeking to recover approximately $56million in payments that were made to the Company by
Fleming during the 90days preceding Flemings bankruptcy filing, and that are alleged to be
avoidable either as preferences or fraudulent transfers under the Bankruptcy Code. The Company
believes that it has valid defenses to certain of the PCTs claims in the proceeding. In December
2005, the PCT offered to settle the case for $2million. The Company countered with an offer to
waive its bankruptcy claim and to pay the PCT $250,000. The PCT rejected the Companys settlement
offer. In February2009, the PCT increased its settlement demand to $35million. On or about
February24, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered a revised scheduling order that, among other
things, set a deadline of April1, 2009 for the parties to commence mediation, established a
deadline of June15, 2009 for completion of discovery, and set a trial for September24-25, 2009.
The litigation is ongoing. In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in and subject to other claims,
contractual disputes and other uncertainties. Management, after reviewing with legal counsel all of
these actions and proceedings, believes that the aggregate losses, if any, will not have a material
adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. bRetirement Obligations The July31, 2005 retirements of the Companys former Chairman, President and CEO, John M.
Cook, and the Companys former Vice Chairman, John M. Toma, resulted in an obligation to pay
retirement benefits of approximately $76million present value basis to be paid in monthly cash
installments principally over a three-year period, beginning February1, 2006. On March16, 2006,
the terms of the applicable severance agreements were amended in conjunction with the Companys
financial restructuring. Pursuant to the terms of the severance agreements, as amended 1the
Companys obligations to pay monthly cash installments to Mr.Cook and Mr.Toma were extended from
36months to 58months and from 24months to 46months, respectively; however, the total dollar
amount of monthly cash payments to be made to each remained unchanged, and 2the Company agreed
to pay a fixed sum of $150,000 to defray the fees and expenses of the legal counsel and financial
advisors to Messrs.Cook and Toma. The original severance agreements, and the severance agreements,
as amended, also provide for an annual reimbursement, beginning on or about February1, 2007, to
Mr.Cook and Mr.Toma for the cost of health insurance for themselves and their respective spouses
not to exceed $25,000 and $20,000, respectively, subject to adjustment based on changes in the
Consumer Price Index, continuing until each reaches the age of 80. At December31, 2008, accrued
payroll and related expenses and noncurrent compensation obligations include $14million and $19
million, respectively, related to these obligations. 14STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company currently has three stock-based compensation plans under which awards have been
granted: 1the Stock Incentive Plan SIP, 2the 2006 Management Incentive Plan 2006 MIP,
and the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan 2008 EIP. The SIP, as amended, authorized the grant of options or other stock-based awards, with respect
to up to 1,237,500 shares of the Companys common stock to key employees, directors, consultants
and advisors. The majority of options granted pursuant to the SIP had five to seven year terms and

Companys six non-employee directors. The options have an exercise price of $1289 per share,
expire seven years after their grant date and became fully vested at the date of the Companys 2008

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $638 per share, $893 per share and $435 per share, respectively. During 2005, in connection with his joining the Company as its President and Chief Executive
Officer, the Company made an inducement option grant outside of its existing stock-based
compensation plans to Mr.James B. McCurry. On September29, 2006, Mr.McCurry voluntarily
surrendered for cancellation his option to purchase all shares under the grant, thus causing an
acceleration of the related compensation costs under SFAS No123R. During the year ended
December31, 2006, the Company recognized compensation expense of $26million related to Mr.
McCurrys inducement option grant. Had Mr.McCurry not voluntarily surrendered his option grant,
the related compensation expense for the year ended December31, 2006 would have been $15million
less. At the annual meeting of shareholders held on August11, 2006, the shareholders of the Company
approved a proposal granting authorization to issue up to 21million shares of the Companys
common stock under the 2006 MIP. On September29, 2006, an aggregate of 682,301 Performance Units
were awarded under the 2006 MIP to the seven executive officers of the Company. The awards had an
aggregate grant date fair value of $40million. At Performance Unit settlement dates which vary,
participants are paid in common stock and in cash. Participants will receive a number of shares of
Company common stock equal to 60% of the number of Performance Units being paid out, plus a cash
payment equal to 40% of the fair market value of that number of shares of common stock equal to the
number of Performance Units being paid out. The awards were 50% vested at the award date and the
remainder of the awards vests ratably over approximately the following eighteen months. The awards
became fully vested on March17, 2008. The awards contain certain anti-dilution and change of
control provisions. Also, the number of Performance Units awarded were automatically adjusted on a
pro-rata basis upon the conversion into common stock of any of the Companys senior convertible
notes or SeriesA convertible preferred stock. During 2006, an additional 122,073 Performance Units
with aggregate grant date fair values of $16million were granted as a result of this automatic
adjustment provision. On March28, 2007, an additional executive officer of the Company was granted 20,000
Performance Units under the 2006 MIP. The award had a grant date fair value of $03million and
vests ratably over four years. During 2007, an additional 1,436,484 Performance Units with
aggregate grant date fair values of $240million were granted to the eight executive officers of
the Company as a result of the automatic adjustment provision related to the conversions of
convertible securities into common stock. All Performance Units must be settled before April30, 2016. The Company recognized
compensation expense creditof $04million, $196million and $34million during the years
ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, related to these 2006 MIP Performance Unit
awards, including $177million and $10million related to the automatic adjustments in the years
ended December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount of compensation expense recognized was
based on the assumption that none of the Performance Unit awards would be forfeited. 70 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On April30, 2008, an aggregate of 493,137 Performance Units were settled by six executive
officers. Such settlements resulted in the issuance of 295,879 shares of common stock and cash
payments totaling $20million. As of December31, 2008, a total of 1,767,721 Performance Unit
awards were outstanding with an aggregate intrinsic value of $72million. A total of 1,742,092
Performance Units are fully vested with an aggregate intrinsic value of $71million. During the years ended December31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, stock-based compensation charges
aggregated $22million, $210million and $64million, respectively. Such charges are included in
selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations. As of December31, 2008, there was $105million of unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense related to stock options, nonvested stock and Performance Unit awards which is
expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 199years. 15FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Management
believes that the carrying amounts for cash, receivables,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued payroll
and related expenses, refund liabilities, deferred revenues, noncurrent compensation obligations
and other long-term liabilities approximate their fair values. Cash equivalents of $233million and $370million as of December31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, are reported at their estimated fair values as of those dates. Fair value
measurements of cash equivalents are based on Level 1 inputs as defined in SFAS No157 quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets. Debt and capital lease obligations of $196million and $459million as of December31, 2008
and 2007, respectively, are reported at their unpaid balances as of those dates based on their
effective borrowing rates and repayment terms when originated. Management believes that the fair
values of such instruments are approximately equal to their carrying values as of those dates. Fair
value measurements of debt and capital lease obligations are based on Level 2 inputs as defined in
SFAS No157 significant other observable inputs. Significant other observable inputs would
include effective borrowing rates for comparable instruments given the Companys perceived credit
risk. 16WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND RESTRUCTURING On August19, 2005, the Company announced that it had taken the initial step in implementing
an expense restructuring plan, necessitated by the Companys declining revenue trend over the
previous two and one-half years. On September30, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors approved
the restructuring plan and authorized implementation of the plan. The expense restructuring plan
encompassed exit activities, including reducing the number of clients served, reducing the number
of countries in which the Company operates, reducing headcount, and terminating operating leases.
As of December31, 2005, the Company had recorded an $112million charge related to the
restructuring, $96million of which was for severance pay and benefits costs pursuant to SFAS No.
112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, and SFAS No88, Employers Accounting
for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits and
$16million of which related to early termination of operating leases recorded in accordance with
SFAS No146. As of December31, 2005, the Company had accrued $12million of early lease
termination costs and leasehold improvement impairment charges of $04million related to these
leases. In 2006, the Company recorded additional restructuring charges for early termination costs
of $14million and leasehold improvement impairment charges of $05million. The 2006 operational
restructuring charges also included $22million related to severance pay and related benefits
costs. In 2007, the Company recorded additional restructuring charges for early lease termination
costs of $13million and leasehold improvement impairment charges of $03million. 71 Table of Contents PRG-SCHULTZ INTERNATIONAL, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES a The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
the Exchange Act Rule13a-15e as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective. b The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the Exchange Act Rule13a-15f. Under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys
President and Chief Executive Officer along with the Companys Chief Financial Officer and
Treasurer, the Company conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment,
management concluded that, as of December31, 2008, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting is effective. The Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2008 has been audited by BDO Seidman, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. c There was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. d Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders
PRG-Schultz International, Inc.
Atlanta, Georgia We have audited PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO
criteria. PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A,
Controls and Procedures. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 73 Table of Contents A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on the
COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of PRG-Schultz International, Inc. and
