REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 8x8, Inc.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly in all material respects, the financial
position of 8x8, Inc. and its subsidiaries at March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended March 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States, which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

8X8, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY
8x8, Inc. the Company or 8x8 was incorporated in California in
February 1987. In December 1996, the Company was reincorporated in Delaware. In
March 2000, the Company announced that it would change its name, subject to
shareholder approval, to Netergy Networks, Inc.
The Company is a leading developer of digital communications products and
technologies, including highly integrated Internet protocol IP telephony
solutions marketed to telephone service providers, semiconductors and related
embedded technology marketed to original equipment manufacturers OEMs of
telecommunication and videoconferencing equipment, and remote video monitoring
systems marketed primarily to dealers and distributors of security products.
See Note 13 regarding the sale of net assets and the license of certain
related technologies associated with the Company video monitoring business as
of May 19, 2000.
FISCAL YEAR
The Company fiscal year ends on the last Thursday in March. For purposes
of these consolidated financial statements, the Company has indicated its fiscal
year ends on March 31. Fiscal year 2000 was a 53 week year, while fiscal years
1999 and 1998 were 52 week years.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment to OEMs and
end users. Reserves for sales returns and allowances are recorded at the time of
shipment. Certain of the Company sales to distributors are made under
agreements which provide for returns or credits under certain circumstances. The
Company defers recognition of revenue on sales to distributors under such
agreements until products are resold by the distributor to the end user. License
revenue, net of any discount granted, is recognized after execution of a license
agreement and delivery of the product, provided there are no remaining
obligations relating to development, upgrades, new releases, or other future
deliverables, and provided that the license fee is fixed or determinable, and
collection of the fee is probable.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Management determines
the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of
purchase and reevaluates the classification at each reporting date. The cost of
the Company investments is determined based upon specific identification.

8X8, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
At March 31, 1999, the Company classified $141 million of its investments,
primarily consisting of money market funds with an effective maturity of three
months or less, as available-for-sale. Investments classified as
available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses,
net of related tax, if any, recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. Unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments were $193,000 at
March 31, 1999. Realized losses on investments classified as available for sale
were approximately $205,000 during the year ended March 31, 2000. Realized and
unrealized gains and losses for all other investments were not significant for
the years ended March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998.
INVENTORY
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates
actual cost using the first-in, first-out method, or market.
NONMARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS
Nonmarketable equity investments, included in other assets, of less than
20% of the investee outstanding voting stock are accounted for using the cost
method because the Company does not have an ability to significantly influence
the operating and financial policies of the investees. Losses resulting from
impairment in the value of investments which are other than a temporary decline
are recorded in the period in which such losses occur. The Company realized a
gain of approximately $19 million on the sale of a nonmarketable equity
investment during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line
method, based upon the shorter of the estimated useful lives, ranging from three
to five years, or the lease term of the respective assets as follows                     
Machinery and computer equipment. 3 years
Furniture and fixtures. 5 years
Licensed  3 years
Leasehold  Shorter of lease term or useful life of
the asset GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Goodwill and other intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition
of Odisei S.A. Odisei in May 1999 were approximately $37 million, and
related accumulated amortization was $614,000 at March 31, 2000 see Note 3.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and the excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of net liabilities acquired was allocated primarily to
workforce and goodwill, which are being amortized over lives of three and five
years, respectively. The Company reviews the carrying value of goodwill and
other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
WARRANTY EXPENSE
The Company accrues for the estimated cost which may be incurred under its
product warranties upon revenue recognition.
RESEARCH AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred.
Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological

are expensed as incurred. The Company defines establishment of technological
feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software development costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through
the period of general market availability of the product are capitalized, if
material. To date, all software development costs have been expensed as
incurred.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of the Company foreign
subsidiaries. Exchange gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in the results of
operations for the year. To date, such amounts have not been significant. Total
assets of the Company foreign subsidiaries were $1,644,000, $656,000 and
$620,000 as of March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company does not
undertake any foreign currency hedging activities.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.
Under the asset and liability approach, a current tax liability or asset is
recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the
current year. A deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated
future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards. If
necessary, the deferred tax assets are reduced by the amount of benefits that,
based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its
cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments primarily in market rate
accounts with reputable financial institutions. The Company has not experienced
any material losses relating to any investment instruments. The Company sells
its products to OEMs and distributors throughout the world. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains
an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable. At March 31, 2000, two customers
accounted for 16% and 14% of accounts receivable, respectively. At March 31,
1999, two customers accounted for 20% and 10% of accounts receivable,
respectively.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The estimated fair value of financial instruments is determined by the
Company, using available market information and valuation methodologies
considered to be appropriate. However, considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly,
the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of
different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a
significant effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The carrying amounts of
the Company cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and
nonmarketable equity investments, approximate their fair values due to their
short maturities. The fair value of the Company convertible subordinated
debentures see Note 7 of $77 million has been estimated using discounted cash
flow analysis, based on the incremental borrowing rate currently available to
the Company for a loan with similar terms and maturity.
ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
interpretations thereof. The Company provides additional pro forma disclosures
as

required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 FAS 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. See Note 9.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income, as
defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from
non-owner sources. The primary difference between net income and comprehensive
income, for the Company, is due to unrealized losses on short-term investments
classified as available-for-sale. Comprehensive income is being shown in the
consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
In fiscal 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 131 FAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information. This statement establishes standards for the way companies
report information about operating segments in annual financial statements. It
also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographical areas and major customers. In accordance with the provisions of FAS
131, beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company has
determined that it has two reportable operating segments. See Note 11.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net income loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss
available to common stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the period denominator. Diluted net income
loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares
and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common
shares result from the assumed exercise, using the treasury stock method, of
outstanding convertible noncumulative preferred stock Preferred Stock, common
stock options, convertible subordinated debentures, warrants and unvested
restricted common stock having a dilutive effect.
The numerators for each period presented are equal to the reported net
income loss. The reconciliation of the denominators used in computing basic
and diluted per share amounts is as follows in thousands                                YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. FAS 133 is effective for all fiscal
quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000 pursuant to the issuance
of FAS 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities -- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133, which
deferred the effective date of FAS 133 by one year. FAS 133 establishes methods
of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. The Company
does not expect that the adoption of FAS 133 will have a material impact on its
consolidated financial statements.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44,
Accounting for Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation, an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25. FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB
25 for certain issues including: a the definition of employee for purposes of
applying APB 25, b the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
noncompensatory plan, c the accounting consequence of various modifications to
the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award, and d the accounting
for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. In
general, FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000. We do not expect the adoption of FIN
44 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results
of operations.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. SAB 101 provides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition issues in financial statements. The Company is
required to adopt SAB 101 by no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.
The Company has reviewed SAB 101 and believes it should not have a significant
impact on its revenue recognition practices.

NOTE 3 -- ACQUISITION OF ODISEI   In May 1999, the Company acquired Odisei, a privately held, development
stage company based in Sophia Antipolis, France, that develops software for
managing voice-over IP networks. The consolidated financial statements reflect
the acquisition of Odisei for approximately 2,988,000 shares of the Company
common stock. Certain of the shares issued to Odisei employee shareholders are
subject to repurchase if the employee departs prior to vesting. Approximately
507,000 shares issued in exchange for restricted stock previously held by
employees of Odisei are subject to repurchase at March 31, 2000. The purchase
price of the acquisition of approximately $135 million, which includes
approximately $277,000 of acquisition related costs, was used to acquire the net
assets of Odisei. The purchase price was allocated to tangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on the book value of Odisei current assets and
liabilities, which the Company believes approximates their fair value. In
addition, the Company engaged an independent appraiser to value the intangible
assets, including amounts allocated to Odisei in-process research and
development. The in-process research and development relates to Odisei initial
product for which technological feasibility had not been established and was
estimated to be approximately 60% complete. The fair value of the in-process
technology was based on a discounted cash flow model which discounts expected
future cash flows to present value, net of tax. In developing cash flow
projections, revenues were forecasted based on relevant factors, including
aggregate revenue growth rates for the business as a whole, characteristics of
the potential market for the technology and the anticipated life of the
technology. Projected annual revenues for the in-process research and
development projects were assumed to ramp up initially and decline significantly
at the end of the in-process technology economic life. Operating expenses and
resulting profit margins were forecasted based on the characteristics and cash
flow generating potential of the acquired in-process technology. Associated
risks include the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in completing the
project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, and risks related to
the impact of potential changes in market conditions and technology. The
resulting estimated net cash flows have been discounted at a rate of 27%. This
discount
43
45

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
rate was based on the estimated cost of capital plus an additional discount for
the increased risk associated with in-process technology. Based on the
independent appraisal, the value of the acquired Odisei in-process research and
development, which was expensed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, was
$101 million. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill.
The allocation of the purchase price is as follows in thousands

acquisition. Had the acquisition taken place as of the beginning of either
fiscal 2000 or fiscal 1999, the pro forma net loss for both periods would have
been substantially the same.
NOTE 4 -- RELATIONSHIP WITH STMICROELECTRONICS   During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company sold 37 million
shares of its common stock to STMicroelectronics NV STM at a purchase price
of $750 per share. In addition, the Company granted STM the right to a seat on
the Company Board of Directors as long as it holds at least 10% of the
Company outstanding shares. STM will have certain rights to maintain its
percentage ownership interest of the Company outstanding voting securities
provided, however, that its total percentage ownership of the outstanding voting
stock of the Company shall not exceed 199%. The Company also granted to STM a
non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to certain technology and will undertake
certain joint development activities with a subsidiary of STM. Under the terms
of the agreement, STM guaranteed certain minimum payments to the Company
totaling $10 million for prepaid royalties and certain non-recurring
engineering services.
Net proceeds from the sale of stock were $277 million, representing a
discount of approximately $74 million from the $351 million fair market value
of the stock on the date of the agreement. The $74 million discount has been
reflected in the fiscal 2000 consolidated financial statements with a charge of
$64 million to selling, general and administrative expense and $10 million
recorded as a sales discount attributable royalty and engineering services to be
provided to STM by the Company.
NOTE 5 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES   The Company purchased $956,000 and $38 million of raw materials inventory
from Sanyo Semiconductor Corporation Sanyo and an affiliate of Sanyo during
the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. An executive of
Sanyo served on the Company Board of Directors through July 15, 1999.
A representative of National Semiconductor Corporation National was a
member of the Company Board of Directors until May 19, 1997. The Company
subleased to National a portion of its facilities under a month to month
sublease arrangement until August 1, 1997. Proceeds from the sublease were
recorded as a reduction to operating expenses and aggregated $149,000 during the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, the Company product revenues
included $355,000 in sales to ASCII Corporation ASCII. The Company
terminated its distribution relationship with ASCII effective June 30, 1997. An
executive of ASCII was a member of the Company Board of Directors until May
27, 1997.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, the Company paid a member of the Board of
Directors approximately $41,000 and $85,000, respectively, for technical
consulting services provided on behalf of the Company.

objective available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that it
will not be able to realize its deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full
valuation allowance was recorded at March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999.
At March 31, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for
federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $357 million and $131
million, respectively, which expire at various dates beginning in 2005. The net
operating loss carryforwards include approximately $32 million resulting from
employee exercises of non-qualified stock options or disqualifying dispositions
the tax benefits of which, when realized, will be accounted for as an addition
to additional paid-in capital rather than as a reduction of the provision for
income taxes. In addition, at March 31, 2000, the Company had research and
development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of
approximately $17 million and 12 million, respectively. The federal credit
carryforwards will begin expiring in 2010 while the California credit will
carryforward indefinitely. Under applicable tax laws, the amount of and benefits
from net operating losses and credits that can be carried forward may be
impaired or limited in certain circumstances. Events which may cause limitations
in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that the Company may utilize
in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change
of more than 50% over a three year period.

quarter of fiscal 1998 upon notice from the Internal Revenue Service that it had
reversed a previously asserted deficiency related to the taxable year 1992.
NOTE 7 -- CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES   In December 1999, the Company issued $75 million of 4% Series A and Series
B convertible subordinated debentures the Debentures. The Debentures mature
on December 17, 2002 unless converted earlier. The $375 million Series A
debentures and $375 million Series B debentures are convertible into the
Company common stock at a conversion price equal to $705 and $3550,
respectively. Interest is payable semiannually.
For the Series A and Series B debentures, the lender received a three year
warrant to purchase approximately 532,000 common shares of the Company at $705
per share and 106,000 shares at $3550 per share, respectively. The Company also
issued warrants to the placement agent in conjunction with the Series A and
Series B debentures equal to approximately 53,000 shares and 11,000 shares,
respectively, at substantially the same terms granted to the lender.
Using the Black-Scholes pricing model, the Company determined that the debt
discount associated with the fair value of the warrants issued to the lender
approximated $22 million. The amortization of the debt discount is being
reflected as a non-cash charge to interest expense over the term of the
warrants. The Company recognized approximately $218,000 of interest expense
associated with amortization of the debt discount during the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000. The debt discount, net of accumulated amortization, is reflected
as a reduction in the face value of the Debentures.
The costs of issuing the Debentures totaled $864,000, including a non-cash
charge of $247,000 for the value of the warrants issued to the placement agent,
were recorded in Intangibles and Other Assets and are being amortized to
interest expense over the term of the Debentures.

In September 1998, the Board of Directors approved a proposal under which
employees elected to cancel approximately 2,107,000 options in exchange for
grants of new options with an exercise price equal to the then current fair
market value. In consideration for such repricing, each participating employee
agreed that they forfeit their right to exercise such options should they resign
from the Company within 12 months of the repricing date.
During the year ended March 31, 1997, options to purchase 2,156,800 shares
under the Key Personnel Plan were exercised for partial recourse notes. Shares
issued under this plan are subject to repurchase at their original issuance
price if the employee leaves the Company prior to vesting. During fiscal 2000,
1999 and 1998                    49

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
the Company repurchased 46,296, 257,685 and 46,638 unvested shares,
respectively. As of March 31, 2000, 9,569 shares were not vested.
In conjunction with the Offering, the Company recorded a deferred
compensation charge of approximately $7,267,000 with respect to options repriced
and certain additional options granted in fiscal 1997. In addition, the Company
recorded an additional deferred compensation charge of approximately $406,000 in
connection with certain options granted to non-officer employees in fiscal 2000.
The Company recognized $161,000, $416,000 and $1,265,000 of said amounts as
compensation expense in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. The Company recognizes deferred compensation over the related
vesting period of the options which is generally 48 months. At March 31, 2000
the balance of deferred compensation was $376,000. Deferred compensation is
subject to reduction for any employee who terminates employment prior to the
expiration of such employee option vesting period.
For disclosure under the provisions of FAS 123, the fair value of each
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, using the multiple option approach with the following

The Company 1996 Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan was adopted in
June 1996 and became effective upon the closing of the Offering. Under the
Purchase Plan, a total of 500,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved
for issuance to participating employees who meet certain eligibility
requirements. At the start of each fiscal year, the number of shares of common
stock subject to the Purchase Plan increases so that 500,000 shares remain
available for issuance. This provision resulted in an increase of 187,491 shares
issuable under the Purchase Plan during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2000.
During fiscal 2000 and 1999, 180,910 and 187,491 shares, respectively, were
issued under the Purchase Plan.
The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock
through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value of
the common stock at the beginning of each two year offering period or the end of
a six month purchase period, whichever is lower. The contribution amount may not
exceed ten percent of an employee base compensation, including commissions but
not including bonuses and overtime, In the event of a merger of the Company with
or into another corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company, the Purchase Plan provides that a new exercise date will
be set for each option under the plan which exercise date will occur before the
date of the merger or asset sale.

In April 1991, the Company adopted a 401k savings plan the Savings
Plan covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. Eligible employees may
contribute to the Savings Plan up to the maximum allowed by the IRS from their
compensation. Effective January 1, 1998, the Company matching contribution
increased from $300 to $1,500 per employee per calendar year at a dollar for
dollar rate of the employee contribution. The Company matching contributions
vest over three years. The Company contributed $124,000 and $144,000 to the
Savings Plan during fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The Company
contributions were not significant for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.
PROFIT SHARING PLAN
In April 1995, the Company Board of Directors approved a profit sharing
plan that provides for additional compensation to all employees of the Company
based on quarterly income before income taxes. The profit sharing plan was
effective beginning in fiscal 1996 and provided for payments of 15% of total
quarterly income before income taxes. In July 1997, the Board of Directors
amended the profit sharing plan such that future profit sharing amounts are
calculated as a percentage of net income. Charges related to this plan
approximated $685,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998, and were not
significant for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2000 or 1999.

NOTE 11 -- SEGMENT REPORTING
Due to a change in the Company organizational during its second quarter
ended September 30, 1999, the Company determined that it had two reportable
segments, Broadband Communications and Video Monitoring, as defined by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. The Broadband Communications segment is
comprised of revenues and direct expenses associated with sales of the Company
products focused on the IP telephony and videoconferencing markets. The Video
Monitoring segment is comprised of revenues and direct expenses associated with
sales of the Company products focused on the video monitoring market. Due to
limitations in the Company internal reporting systems, it is not practicable
to disclose results for the segments for the three months ended June 30, 1999 or
for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998. The following illustrates
results by segment for the period during which the information was available                                REVENUES  OPERATING LOSS

There are no intersegment revenues between the two reportable segments.
Shared support service functions such as human resources, facilities management
and other infrastructure support and overhead are not allocated, but rather are
included in the Corporate and Other category. In addition, all activities
associated with the Company ViaTV product line, which has been discontinued,
have been included in the Corporate and Other Category. Lastly, special charges
which are reported separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are
not assigned or allocated to the segments, but rather have been included in the
Corporate and Other category. All other accounting policies are applied
consistently to the segments, where applicable. The only asset allocated by
segment is inventory. Inventory allocated to the Broadband Communications and
Video Monitoring segments at March 31, 2000 was approximately $983,000 and
$384,000, respectively.

other revenues derived from one customer represented approximately 20% of total
revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998.
NOTE 12 -- INVENTORY CHARGES   In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company determined that a
combination of factors including the high cost of maintaining a consumer
distribution channel, the slower than expected growth rate of the consumer
videophone market, and the low gross margins typical of a consumer electronics
product made it unlikely that the consumer videophone business would be
profitable in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the Company announced in April
1999 that it would cease production of the ViaTV product line and withdraw from
its distribution channels over the subsequent several quarters. In conjunction
with this decision the Company recorded a $57 million charge associated with
the write off of ViaTV videophone inventories.
NOTE 13 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   On May 19, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire UForce,
Inc. UForce by issuing approximately 36 million shares of the Company
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of UForce. In
addition, the Company will issue common stock options for approximately 10
million shares in exchange for all outstanding UForce stock options. The
transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method. The acquisition is
subject to certain closing conditions, and the Company anticipates completing
the acquisition during its second fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2000.
Also, on May 19, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with
Interlogix, Inc. Interlogix whereby the Company agreed to sell certain
assets and license certain technology related to the Company video monitoring
business. The Company is obligated to provide Interlogix with future updates and
upgrades to the licensed technology. The assets sold included certain accounts
receivable, inventories, machinery, equipment, and intangibles. Interlogix
agreed to pay the Company $55 million, subject to certain adjustments, for the
assets and the associated technology license, which has an initial term of three
years. Upon the earlier of six months from the date of the agreement or upon
delivery of certain remaining obligations, the Company will commence recognition
of the resulting net gain over the remaining term of the technology license.
