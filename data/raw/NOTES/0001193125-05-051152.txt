REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  The Board of Directors and Shareholders Radiologix, Inc.  We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Radiologix, Inc. did not maintain an effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, because of the effect of a material weakness in Radiologix, Inc.s procedures for comparing cash collections to gross charges used to estimate contractual adjustments and the provision for
doubtful accounts to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross accounts receivable to their net realizable amounts, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Radiologix, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.  A material weakness is a control deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and
included in managements assessment: In its assessment, management identified as a material weakness inadequate controls over procedures for comparing cash collections to gross charges. These procedures are used to estimate contractual
adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts. The effect of this was to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross accounts receivable to their net realizable amounts. Consequently, the Company recorded an increase in contractual
adjustments of $91 million and a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2004, after year-end, in connection with the financial statement close process for the year ended December 31, 2004.
This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 8, 2005 on those financial statements.
In our opinion, managements assessment that Radiologix, Inc. did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO control criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described
above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Radiologix, Inc. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO control criteria.  Ernst Young LLP

RADIOLOGIX, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002  NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  Radiologix, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, Radiologix or
the Company, a Delaware corporation, is a leading national provider of diagnostic imaging services through its ownership and operation of free-standing, outpatient diagnostic imaging centers.  Radiologix utilizes sophisticated technology and technical expertise to
perform a broad range of imaging procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging MRI, computed tomography CT, position emission tomography PET, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, mammography, bone densitometry DEXA, general radiology X-ray and
fluoroscopy. As of December 31, 2004, we owned, operated or maintained, through our two operating segments, an ownership interest in imaging equipment at 76 locations with imaging centers located in 10 states, including primary operations in the
Mid-Atlantic; the Bay Area, California; Treasure Coast, Florida; Northeast Kansas; and the Finger Lakes Rochester and Hudson Valley markets in New York state; and Questar operations with imaging centers located in Arizona, California, Colorado and
Minnesota. We offer multi-modality imaging services at 52 of our diagnostic imaging centers, which provide patients and referring physicians access to advanced diagnostic imaging services in one convenient location.  We also provide administrative, management and information services to
certain radiology practices that provide professional services in connection with our diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and radiology practices with which we operate joint ventures. The services we provide leverage our existing
infrastructure and, we believe, improve the profitability, efficiency and effectiveness of the radiology practice or joint venture.  Our results may be impacted by variability due to changes in modality mix and the volume of procedures performed, physician referral and vacation
patterns, the impact of hospital and physician-affiliated imaging centers that compete in our primary and Questar operations, the timing and negotiation of managed care and service contracts, the availability of technologists and other personnel
resources, and trends in receivable collectibility. We are impacted by seasonality in that referring physicians and technologists often schedule vacations in the summer months which typically results in a decline in our volumes and service fee
revenue while increasing cost of services as we contract for the services of temporary technologists at higher rates.  NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Basis of Presentation  The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities that the Company does not control, but in which it has a substantial
ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  We have reclassified certain previously reported amounts, including 1 our results of operations to a gross profit presentation, 2 balances
and results of operations related to subsequently discontinued operations to conform to the current period presentation and 3 supply rebates from general and administrative costs to field supplies, which is a component of cost of services in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations. These reclassifications have no impact on assets, liabilities, stockholders equity, net income loss, or cash flows.  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, results of operations and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
45 Table of Contents
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated using the
straight-line method. Amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization.  Goodwill, Intangible and Long-lived Assets  The value of goodwill and intangible assets is stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Goodwill is not subject to amortization; however it is subject
to periodic valuation assessments. Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to perform at least an annual impairment test and to consider other
indicators that may arise throughout the year to reevaluate carrying value. To the extent book value exceeds fair value, at the date an impairment is determined, the Company reduces goodwill by recording a charge to operations. We perform our annual
impairment test in the first quarter of each fiscal year.  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, requires impairment losses to be recognized for long-lived assets through operations when
indicators of impairment exist and the underlying cash flows are not sufficient to support the assets carrying value. In addition, SFAS No. 144 requires that a long-lived asset disposal group to be sold that meets certain recognition
criteria be classified as held for sale and measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. SFAS No. 144 also requires that a long-lived asset subject to closure abandonment before the end of its previously
estimated useful life continue to be classified as held and used until disposal, with depreciation estimates revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life.  In addition to the annual impairment test we perform with respect to
goodwill, we regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or that the remaining estimated useful life should
be changed. Potential indicators of impairment can include, but are not limited to 1 history of operating losses or expected future losses; 2 significant adverse change in legal factors; 3 changes in the extent or manner in which the assets
are used; 4 current expectations to dispose of the assets by sale or other means and 5 reductions or expected reductions of cash flow. In the event that we determine there is an indication of impairment, we compare undiscounted net cash flows to
the carrying value of the respective asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows we perform an impairment calculation using discounted cash flows, valuation analysis from independent valuation specialists or comparisons to
recent sales or purchase transactions to determine estimated fair value.  Deferred Financing Costs  Deferred financing
costs are amortized on a straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was approximately $51 million and $35 million, respectively.
Accrued Physician Retention  Accrued physician retention represents amounts payable to contracted
radiology practices under the medical services agreements. The service agreements require Radiologix to remit physician retention to the contracted radiology practices by the end of the month after the month in which services were rendered.
Revenue Recognition  Service fee revenue from contracted radiology practice groups professional
revenue component and diagnostic imaging centers technical revenue component is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers based on established gross charges billed and reduced by
estimated contractual adjustments and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practice groups under the terms of medical services agreements. Our patient accounting system currently does not record contractual adjustments at the time of
billing. Instead, contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection analysis, which we began using in December 2004, payment-versus-charge
schedules and aging models. Should circumstances change shift in payor mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables, our estimates of the net realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a
material amount. We plan to implement a system in fiscal 2005 that will allow us to record contractual adjustments at the time of billing. We have estimated that a change in our collection percentage of 10% could result in a change in service fee
revenue of $50 million per year.

Revenue Presentation  The Financial Accounting Standards Boards Emerging Issues Task Force issued its abstract, Issue 97-2, Application of FASB Statement No. 94 and
APB Opinion No. 16 to Physicians Practice Management Entities and Certain Other Entities with Contractual Arrangements EITF 97-2. Since Radiologix has not established a controlling financial interest under EITF 97-2, Radiologix
does not consolidate the contracted radiology practices.  Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Developing our provision for income taxes, including our effective tax rate,
and analysis of potential tax exposure items, if any, requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, any estimated
valuation allowances we deem necessary to value deferred tax assets. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities. While we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated
financial statements, adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosure About Fair Value of Financial Instruments, requires disclosure about the fair
value of certain financial instruments. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The estimates of fair value
are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long term-debt with the same maturities, when available, or discounted cash flows.  Concentration of Credit Risk  The Companys accounts receivable consist primarily of service fee revenue generated by radiology practices and imaging centers for services
performed, that are immediately purchased by us and ultimately due from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care and private and other payors. The Company estimates that approximately 29%, 28% and 27% of the these revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were funded through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Company and its contracted radiology practices perform ongoing credit evaluations of their patients and generally do not require collateral. The Company and its contracted
radiology practices maintain estimated allowances for potential credit losses.  Stock-Based Awards  The Company currently
accounts for its employee stock-based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic-value method pursuant to the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Accordingly,
because stock options are issued at fair value at the date of grant we do not recognize compensation expense for our stock option grants.  In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure SFAS No. 148. SFAS No. 148 provides companies alternative methods of transitioning to Statement of Accounting Standards No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS No. 123 which promulgates a fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also requires certain disclosure in both annual and quarterly financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. SFAS No. 148 does not mandate fair value accounting for stock-based employee compensation, but does require all companies to meet the disclosure requirements.  On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123. Statement 123R supersedes APB 25, and amends Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123R is similar to the
approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is
no longer an alternative. 
47 Table of Contents
Statement 123R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods
in which financial statements have not yet been issued. We expect to adopt Statement 123R on July 1, 2005. Statement 123R permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods:  1.
A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of Statement 123R for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of Statement 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.
2.
A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the
amounts previously recognized under Statement 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption.  The Company plans to adopt Statement 123R on July 1, 2005 using the a
modified-prospective method. As of December 31, 2004 we have not determined the effect that the adoption of Statement 123R will have on our financial position and results of operations.  NOTE 3. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  A summary of goodwill and intangible assets at December 31, 2004 and 2003 is as follows in thousands:  EstimatedUsefulLife

for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $38 million, $38 million and $34 million, respectively. The estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is $37 million, or $185 million in the aggregate.  Effective October 31, 2004, we entered into a definitive agreement to
purchase, for $155 million in cash, diagnostic imaging equipment and an equipment financing right that was granted prior to the formation of Radiologix, and to assume certain equipment leases. As a result of this acquisition, we recorded a $139
million intangible asset for this equipment financing right which we are amortizing over 18 years, the remaining accounting life of the underlying medical services agreement initially 25 years.  Under this financing right, the seller had a perpetual right to finance
certain types of equipment on behalf of Radiologix and to charge the Company usage-based rent on these pieces of equipment. Service fee revenue is not affected as a result of this purchase. Instead, this acquisition eliminates expenses that
previously varied based on volume resulting in incremental reductions in equipment lease expense as volume increases. If this transaction had been effective on January 1, 2004 instead of October 31, 2004, we estimate that cost of services would have
increased by $500,000, equipment lease expense would have decreased by $45 million, depreciation and amortization would have increased by $14 million and pre-tax loss would have decreased by $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
unaudited.  Intangible assets related to medical services
agreements are primarily the result of acquisitions of imaging centers and affiliations with radiology practices in which the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the radiology practices. Simultaneously with these
acquisitions, the Company entered into medical services agreements with radiology practices whereby the Company provides management, administrative, technical and non-medical services. For providing services under these agreements, the Company
receives a fee which is structured to align the interests of the Company and the radiology practices. Additionally, the medical services agreements restrict the radiology practices from competing with the Company and any other of the Companys
radiology practices within a specified geographic area during the term of the medical service agreements and also require each radiology practice to obtain and enforce similar restrictive covenants with the full-time physicians affiliated with their
practices.

NOTE 4. IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS  Impairment - Medical Services Agreement  During the third quarter of 2004, management determined that the ability of
one of the radiology groups to perform in accordance with a medical services agreement administered by one of our Mid-Atlantic subsidiaries had diminished significantly. With several owned imaging centers covered by the medical services agreement
operating at financial losses, deteriorating financial conditions at hospitals involving professional reading arrangements, and the resignation from the practice of two physician leaders, management concluded that the value of our intangible asset
had become significantly impaired.  As a result, Radiologix and
the radiology group agreed to terminate the medical services agreement. The Company has decided to dispose of three unprofitable imaging centers and to transfer the professional reading responsibility for certain other centers to another radiology
group that operates under a medical services agreement with us in the Mid-Atlantic market. As of December 31, 2004, the Company will no longer be a party to most of the other professional reading arrangements at certain hospitals and accordingly, we
will receive minimal revenue from these arrangements in 2005.  Based on our assessment and the actions that we have undertaken, the Company recorded impairment charges of: $65 million to write-off the unamortized portion of intangible assets related to this groups medical services agreement, and
$800,000 to write-off long-lived assets related to the centers planned for disposition, one of which was disposed of in December 2004.  Revenues and pre-tax income for the remaining two centers planned for disposition in July and November 2005, respectively, and the professional reading
arrangements that we will no longer be a party to, as reflected in continuing operations including impairment charges, are as follows in thousands:  For the Year Ended December 31 2004 2003

Subsidiary  In December 2004, we recorded an impairment
charge of $11 million to reduce goodwill related to our Questar center in Arizona. This center is one of six Questar sites that remain in continuing operations at December 31, 2004. We did not anticipate this impairment previously as the center is
in a strategic location and was projected to improve in volumes, revenues and cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2004 and throughout 2005. However, it appears that because of disruption caused by the move to this new location, confusion in the
community due to a change in the centers name, and increased local competition, we have had difficulty in achieving the volumes, profitability and cash flow levels that we expected in the fourth quarter of 2004 and budgeted for in 2005.
Accordingly, although we intend to keep this center open in an attempt to engineer a turnaround in its operations, our revised volume, profitability and cash flow estimates did not support the recoverability of this centers goodwill at
December 31, 2004.  In June 2004, after performing an extensive
assessment of our Questar imaging center portfolio, management concluded that seven centers were not strategic to our future plans and would be unable to meet and sustain our profitability requirements going forward. That assessment considered the
following: location, contracting leverage, expected capital requirements, the single modality nature of most of these centers, current operating trends, and the sale of our most profitable Questar center on June 21, 2004.  The Companys decision to dispose of these seven imaging centers created
an event that required us to reassess the carrying value of the assets related to these centers, including goodwill at our Questar segment. This reassessment considered the impact on the value of the ongoing, deteriorating operating trends in these
centers, as well as the implications of disposing of individual centers versus operating those centers as part of an ongoing operating enterprise.  To assist us in that reassessment, we engaged an independent valuation firm to estimate the fair value of our combined Questar sites. The valuation
performed by this firm was based on a blending of: 1 discounted cash flows and an exit multiple for the business, 2 a market approach using public company information, discounted to reflect the nature of the Questar operations, and 3
individual transactions experienced by Radiologix and similar companies in recent months. At managements recommendation, the valuation firm applied a high 70% weighting factor to the valuation derived under the individual transaction method
described in 3 above. 
49 Table of Contents
Based on the independent valuation, Radiologix recognized an impairment charge of $104 million in the
second quarter of 2004 to reduce the Questar goodwill carrying value to estimated fair value. This charge is in addition to the $55 million charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2004 related to Questar in connection with our annual assessment
of goodwill. The first quarter valuation included the operating results of our most profitable Questar center and also gave equal weighting factors to an income and market approach. We also recorded a $617,000 pretax charge to impair long-lived
assets of certain Questar centers in June 2004.  In 2003 and
2002, we recorded impairment charges of $89 million and $27 million, respectively, to write-down goodwill and long-lived assets, respectively, related to Questar imaging centers using expected sales values determined based on individual
transactions experienced by Radiologix and our knowledge of the business environment, to estimate fair value.  The components of our impairment charges are as follows in thousands:  For the Year Ended December 31 2004

sold our 80% joint venture interest in our Questar Tampa operations, including accounts receivable, to our venture partner for $275,000 in cash, resulting in a loss of $591,000, including the write-off of goodwill for $354,000.  In June 2004 we sold a Questar center for $31 million in cash, resulting in
a gain of $682,000 net of a write-off of goodwill for $500,000.  The balance of goodwill, which relates entirely to Questar, is approximately $22 million at December 31, 2004.  The Company regularly considers whether events or circumstances may affect either the fair value of recorded intangible assets or their associated useful
lives. At December 31, 2004, the combined operations of our remaining six Questar centers are generating positive cash flow; and, the Company does not believe there are any additional indicators that the carrying values or the useful lives of these
assets need to be adjusted. However, in the event we decide to dispose of any remaining Questar centers, additional charges may result depending on cash flow and market conditions at the time of disposal.

NOTE 7. SERVICE FEE REVENUE  Radiologix has two models by which it contracts with radiology practices: a comprehensive services model and a technical
services model. Under the comprehensive services model, the Company enters into a long-term agreement with a radiology practice group typically 40 years. Under this arrangement, in addition to earning technical service fee revenue for the use of
Radiologixs diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services, the Company provides management services and receives a service fee revenue based on the practice groups professional revenue, including revenue outside of
our diagnostic imaging centers. Under the technical services model, the Company enters into a shorter-term agreement with a radiology practice group typically 10 to 15 years and earns service fee revenue and pays them a fee based on cash
collections from reimbursements for imaging procedures.  Service fee revenue of the contracted radiology practice groups professional revenue component and diagnostic imaging centers technical revenue component is recorded when services are rendered by the contracted radiology practices and
diagnostic imaging centers based on established gross charges billed and reduced by estimated contractual allowances and amounts retained by the contracted radiology practice groups under the terms of medical services agreements. Our patient
accounting system currently does not record contractual allowances at the time of billing. Instead, allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are estimated based on historical collection experience using a retrospective collection
analysis, which we began using in the fourth quarter of 2004, payment-versus-charge schedules and aging models. Should circumstances change shift in payor mix, decline in economic conditions or deterioration in aging of patient receivables, our
estimates of the net realizable value of patient receivables could be reduced by a material amount. Because Radiologix has no financial controlling interest in the radiology practice groups, as defined in Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 97-2 EITF
97-2, the Company does not consolidate the financial statements of those practices in its consolidated financial statements.  The following table sets forth the amounts of revenue for the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers that would have been presented
in the consolidated statements of operations had Radiologix met the provisions of EITF 97-2 in thousands:  2004 2003 2002 Revenue for contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers, net of contractual adjustments 352,308 339,385 357,920 Amounts retained by contracted radiology practices 101,017 97,347 101,576 Service fee revenue 251,291 242,038 256,344  The Companys service fee revenue
is dependent upon the operating results of the contracted radiology practices and diagnostic imaging centers. Where state law allows, service fees due under the service agreements for the contracted radiology practices are derived from two distinct
revenue streams: 1 a negotiated percentage of the professional revenues, reduced by certain expenses, as defined in the medical services agreements; and 2 100% of the adjusted technical revenues as defined in the service agreements. In states
where the law requires a flat fee structure, Radiologix has negotiated a base service fee, which approximates the estimated fair market value of the services provided under the service agreements and which is renegotiated each year. Service fee
revenue is comprised of the following in thousands:  2004

December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 6%, 6% and 4%, respectively, of our diagnostic imaging center service fee revenue was generated from capitated arrangements. Of this 6%, two-thirds relates to contracts with two physician groups and
the remainder relates to two contracts with one managed care payor.  We also contract with several Blue Cross and Blue Shield payors, which are major payors for us in several markets.  For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, four of the Companys contracted radiology practices each contributed 10% or more of the
Companys service fee revenue in at least one of the last three years as follows in thousands:  Practice

As disclosed in our 2004 Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, we expected to finalize a retrospective
collection analysis of our accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2004. Accordingly, in connection with our December 2004 year-end closing process, we did finalize this retrospective collection analysis. This retrospective process represents
an enhancement to our methodology for estimating the amount of contractual adjustments and provision for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross receivables to net amounts realizable from managed care,
Medicare, Medicaid, private and other payors. This enhanced methodology is based on the matching of cash collections to billed charges by month of service. In connection with our provision for doubtful accounts, we continue to record this expense
based on historical write-offs, which experience has not significantly changed. As a result of the above process, we increased contractual adjustments by $91 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and accounts
receivable in the fourth quarter of 2004 to reflect the change in estimate in net realizable value.  NOTE 8. MEDICAL SERVICES AGREEMENTS  In addition to the medical services agreement we terminated effective January 31, 2005 see Note 4, we amended 1 a medical services agreement which resulted in a 15% reduction in our management fee effective
January 1, 2004 and 2 a separate medical services agreement which resulted in the establishment of a technical bonus to the contracted radiology group and a 3% reduction in our management fee effective October 1, 2004.
Our management fees for certain other medical services
agreements declined by 1% in 2004 and will decline by an additional 1% in 2005. The estimated annual impact to our service fee revenue for these 1% decreases is approximately $650,000.  In connection with the amendment of a medical services agreement with a contracted radiology group in July 2002, the Company
recorded deferred revenue of $33 million in consideration for the amended agreement, which amount is amortized over 20 years. In December 2002, the Company amended the medical services agreement of another contracted radiology practice and recorded
deferred revenue of $48 million in consideration for the amended agreement, which is amortized over 19 years.  NOTE 9. LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  Long-term debt and capital lease obligations consists of the following at December 31, 2004 and 2003 in thousands:  2004 2003 105% Senior Notes, due December 15, 2008 158,270 160,000 8% Convertible Junior Subordinated Note due July 2009 11,980 11,980 Note payable to bank and capital lease obligations, various interest rates 249 2,075 170,499 174,055 Current portion of long-term debt and capital lease obligations 157 1,699 Long-term debt and capital lease obligations, net of current portion 170,342 172,356  The maturities of
long-term debt, including capital lease obligations are approximately $157,000 in fiscal 2005, $32,000 in fiscal 2006, $34,000 in fiscal 2007, $1583 million due in fiscal 2008 and $120 million due in fiscal 2009.  At December 31, 2004, we had not met certain incurrence tests under our debt
agreements. As a result, we are limited to borrowing an additional $200 million until such time as we meet these tests.  Senior Notes  The Companys $1583 million in senior notes due December 15, 2008, bear interest at 105% payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December
15. The senior notes are redeemable on or after December 15, 2005 at various redemption prices, plus accrued interest to the date of redemption. These notes are unsecured obligations, which rank senior in right of payment to all subordinated
indebtedness and equal in right of payment with all other senior indebtedness. The senior notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain restricted existing and future subsidiaries. In the 2004 second quarter, the
Company retired $173 million of these senior notes at a price equal to 10325% of face value. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, our senior notes were trading at 1105% and 995% of face value, respectively.  Convertible Junior Subordinated Note  The Company has a $120 million convertible junior subordinated note, which
matures July 31, 2009, and bears interest, payable quarterly in cash or in-kind securities, at an annual rate of 80%. The note holder may convert borrowings under the note to common stock at $752 per share. This note is considered in the
calculation of diluted earnings per share as applicable see Note 16. The market value of these notes is not readily determinable. 
53 Table of Contents
Revolving Credit Agreement  At December 31, 2004, amounts considered outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled $13 million related to two
letters of credit in connection with our high retention workers compensation program with $293 million available for borrowings. Borrowings under this line are limited to 85% of eligible accounts receivable, as defined under the credit
facility. Borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets and a pledge of the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries.  NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Master Lease Agreement  Radiologix maintains operating leases for certain imaging equipment under an Amended and Restated Master Lease Agreement with GE Healthcare Financial
Services GE. Through this arrangement, GE has agreed to fund up to $600 million of equipment leases through December 31, 2006, and requires that at least two-thirds of the outstanding balance represent GE healthcare equipment.  In connection with the Master Lease Agreement, the Company is required to
provide additional cash collateral in a restricted account equal to 20% of the aggregate amounts outstanding under the Master Lease Agreement. The accompanying December 31, 2004 balance sheet includes $55 million of restricted cash under this
provision.  The Master Lease Agreement also contains certain
covenants related to financial leverage, fixed charge coverage, and total indebtedness to GE. Failure to comply with these covenants would restrict our ability to lease additional equipment under the Master Lease Agreement until the covenants are
met. GE provided us with a written waiver stating that GE agreed to waive compliance with the financial leverage ratio for the year ending December 31, 2004 and to modify this calculation for 2005 to exclude the $91 million adjustment described in
Note 7.  At December 31, 2004, applicable amounts outstanding
under the Master Lease Agreement totaled $277 million; and $269 million remained available for future leases. Commitments for leases signed but not placed in service under the Master Lease Agreement were $54 million at December 31, 2004.
Leases  The Company leases office and facility space as well as certain diagnostic equipment under operating leases. Future minimum
lease payments under these operating leases for fiscal 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and thereafter are $222 million, $194 million, $177 million, $152 million, $105 million, and $184 million, respectively. Combined equipment and
facility lease expense was approximately $313 million, $300 million and $271 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  Our facility lease terms generally vary in length from 1 year to 15 years with renewal options upon prior written notice, from 1 year to 10 years
depending on the agreed upon terms with the local landlord. Facility lease amounts generally increase from 1% to 4% on an annual basis. We do not have options to purchase the facilities we currently lease. These leases usually contain exclusivity
clauses prohibiting the landlord from leasing space to potentially competitive businesses within a defined distance of our existing locations.  Our equipment lease agreements are generally negotiated through either GE or Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. These leases typically contain payment
terms from 60 to 62 months and may include early buy-out options equal to the estimated fair market value of the equipment, plus applicable taxes, at the time of the option.  Litigation  Our current litigation is i expected to be covered by liability insurance or ii is not expected to adversely affect our business. Some risk exists,
however, that we could subsequently be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits or that pending litigation could escalate and adversely affect us.  Self-insurance  We are self-insured with respect to health benefits provided to our employees. Additionally, in connection with malpractice and workers compensation
coverage, we generally are self-insured for initial retention levels of $100,000 and $500,000, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we believe we are adequately reserved for estimated potential obligations under these arrangements. 
54 Table of Contents
Other Matters  As part of a routine, ongoing compliance and legal review, we determined that lease terms negotiated in connection with subletting space from physician
landlords at several Radiologix locations may have exceeded fair market value. In fiscal 2003, Radiologix sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health Human Services Office of the Inspector General OIG, informing them of
the preliminary findings. Radiologix has qualified for the Provider Self-disclosure Protocol of the OIG. The Provider Self-disclosure Protocol is a self-reporting program that provides for minimizing the cost and disruption associated with on-going
investigations of the OIG. We have submitted our findings to the OIG and are waiting for their response. As a result, we cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  NOTE 11. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 41 FIN 46. In December 2003, the FASB modified FIN 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen. FIN 46 provides a new
framework for identifying variable interest entities VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.  In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited liability
corporation, trust or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either 1 has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, 2 has a group
of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities, or 3 has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations. However, FIN 46
specifically excludes a VIE that is a business if the variable interest holder did not participate significantly in the design or redesign of the entity.  We adopted the provisions of FIN 46 as of March 31, 2004. We have reviewed the Companys unconsolidated joint ventures and contracted radiology
practice arrangements under the provision and have determined that none of these arrangements or joint ventures meets the definition of a variable interest entity.  NOTE 12. 401K PLAN  The Company established a defined contribution plan the 401k plan in January 1999. Employees are eligible immediately upon date of hire.
The 401k plan allows for a discretionary employer match of contributions made by participants after such participants have completed 1,000 hours of service. With respect to the Company match, a participant vests 20% after two years of service, 40%
after three years of service, 60% after four years of service, 80% after five years of service and 100% after six years of service.  The Company may make matching contributions under this plan of up to 3% of the participants compensation if the participant contributes 6% or more
of their compensation. For participants who contribute less than 6% of their compensation, matching contributions may be made up to 50% of the amount contributed. Company contributions to the plan were approximately $12 million in 2004, $11
million in 2003 and $10 million in 2002.  NOTE 13. STOCKHOLDERS
EQUITY  Under the 1996 Stock Option Plan the 1996
Plan, an initial 4,000,000 options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock were available for grant to key directors, employees and other healthcare professionals associated with Radiologix, as defined by the 1996 Plan. On July
15, 2004, the Companys stockholders approved the adoption of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan. As a result, all future stock award grants will be made under the 2004 Plan. The total number of shares reserved and available for grant under the
2004 Plan are 3,000,000 plus any shares remaining available for grant under the prior 1996 Plan. Options granted under the 2004 Plan may be either incentive stock options ISO or nonqualified stock options NQSO. The option
price per share under the 2004 Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value at the grant date for ISO and may not be less than 85% of the fair market value at the grant date for NQSO. All of the options granted under the 2004 and 1996
Plans through December 31, 2004 were at fair market value on the date of grant. Generally, options vest over a five-year period and are exercisable over a ten-year life. In 2004, 200,000 options were granted which vest in portions based on the
Companys common stock exceeding various stock closing sales prices for 20 consecutive days. These performance based options were cancelled on December 31, 2004 upon termination of the employee option holder. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, 3,091,503, 2,694,710 and 2,732,710 options, respectively, were outstanding under the 2004 and 1996 Plans. Included in the December 31, 2004 balance are 467,088 options related to a 300,000 Restricted Stock Award to our Chief Executive Officer
and Restricted Stock Unit of 11,392 to a director, which awards count as 15 options for every 1 award granted, pursuant to Section 4a of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Since the 1996 Plans inception, the Board of Directors

435,390 868 1,735,494  During the year ended
December 31, 2004, the Company granted 1,125,000 options to purchase the Companys common stock, primarily as employment inducements for key executives. Of these options, 275,000 vest at the date of grant; 40,000 vest after one year; 350,000
vest over a four-year period; 260,000 vest over a five-year period; and 200,000 vest in specified increments, based on the performance at stock prices ranging from $500 to $1750 per share of the Companys common stock for consecutive 20-day
periods applicable to the increment. The 200,000 performance based options were cancelled on December 31, 2004 upon termination of the employee option holder. During 2003, the Company issued 100,000 options to a consultant, of which 30,000 vested
immediately and the remaining 70,000 options vest in portions based on the Companys common stock exceeding various stock closing sales prices for 20 consecutive days. The Company recognized $40,000 and $27,000 of compensation expense in 2004
and 2003, respectively, related to these options. The Company granted a Restricted Stock Award of 300,000 shares and a Restricted Stock Unit of 11,392 shares in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company recognized compensation expense in the amount of
$38,000 related to these Restricted Stock grants.

The summary below presents the pro-forma financial results that would have been reported if the Company
had applied the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 dollars are presented in thousands, except per share amounts:  2004 2003 2002 Net income loss, as reported 18,036 7,963 10,756 Total stock-based compensation expensed in net income loss, net of related tax effects 47 40 Total stock-based compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 1,009 1,482 1,726 Pro forma net income loss 18,998 9,405 9,030 Income loss per common share Basicas reported 083 037 051 Basicpro forma 087 043 043 Income loss per share Dilutedas reported 083 037 048 Dilutedpro forma 087 043 041
The fair value of each
option grant is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively: risk-free interest rate of 423, 427, and 461 percent;
expected life of 545, 527 and 544 years; expected volatility of 388, 616, and 1194 percent; and dividend yield of zero in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of new grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was
$190 per share, $256 per share, and $1156 per share, respectively. The stock-based compensation expense determined under the fair value based method presented on a pro forma basis includes an adjustment during the year ended December 31, 2004 to
reverse expenses related to certain variable options that were cancelled. As permitted by APB 25, the Company originally reported an expense for the total estimated amount for these options on a pro forma basis in the period the options were
granted.  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock
price volatility. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.  NOTE 14.

$6,057,000 of net deferred tax liabilities included $1,797,000 classified as current and $4,260,000 classified as noncurrent in the accompanying 2003 balance sheet.  The federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards principally expire in 2024.  We have significant noncurrent deferred tax assets at December 31, 2004.
Realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the twenty-year loss carryforward period. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that
all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.  NOTE 15. GAIN ON SALE OF OPERATIONS  Effective April 30, 2004, we completed the sale of our operations in San
Antonio, Texas. The purchase price was $105 million, resulting in a gain on sale of approximately $47 million or $31 million net of taxes $014 per share. Net cash received was $97 million after purchase price adjustments. The sale included
1 assets we owned and leased in our operation of MS Imaging Partners, Inc., 2 a diagnostic imaging center, and 3 certain partnership interests, but did not include accounts receivable aggregating approximately $47 million, which we
retained.  Results of operations for the San Antonio operations

Basic earnings loss per share EPS is calculated by
dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased during the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003
primarily due to the exercise of stock options.

stock method for options and warrants to the extent that these securities are not anti-dilutive. Diluted EPS also includes the effect of the convertible junior subordinated note using the if converted method to the extent these
securities are not anti-dilutive.  For the Year Ended December 31 2004

For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, 449,409 and
224,144 shares, respectively, of stock options were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because to do so would be anti-dilutive.  NOTE 17. UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES JOINT VENTURES  The Company has seven unconsolidated joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from 22% to 50%. These joint ventures represent partnerships with
hospitals, health systems or radiology practices and were formed for the purpose of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers. Professional services at the joint venture diagnostic imaging centers are performed by contracted radiology
practices or a radiology practice that participates in the joint venture. The Companys investments in these joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we reduced our equity in earnings by $286,000
to reflect an increase in contractual adjustments and a corresponding reduction in account receivable for certain of these joint ventures. Other assets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 include notes receivable from certain
unconsolidated joint ventures aggregating $21 million and $29 million, respectively. Interest income related to these notes receivable was approximately $245,000, $241,000, and $361,000 in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The Company
also received management service fees of $24 million, $22 million and $20 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively, in connection with operating the centers underlying these joint ventures.  The following table is a summary of key financial data for these joint

NOTE 18. SEGMENT REPORTING  The Companys primary operations consist of owning and operating diagnostic imaging centers and providing
administrative, management and information services to the contracted radiology practice groups that provide professional interpretation and supervision services in connection with the Companys diagnostic imaging centers and to hospitals and
radiology practices with which the Company operates joint ventures.  The Company previously reported its primary operations through four reportable segments comprised of four designated regions of the United States of America. As a result of an assessment of these operations, including how resources are
allocated by members of our senior management team the chief operating decision maker function, and because the four designated regions have: 1 substantially all resources allocated to them, 2 similar economic characteristics, 3
similar operations and 4 similar regulatory environments, we have aggregated them into a single reportable operating segment.  Because of different characteristics from our primary operations, including location, market concentration, contracting leverage, capital requirements,
the single modality nature of most of the centers and the structure of the management service agreements with physicians related to the Companys Questar operations, senior management makes resource allocation decisions separately for Questar
and its primary operations.  The following table summarizes the
operating results, including continuing and discontinued operations, and assets of our primary and Questar operations in thousands:  For the Year Ended December 31, 2004 PrimaryOperations Questar Total Service fee revenue 242,064 9,227 251,291 Total costs and expenses 218,173 14,863 233,036 Income loss before equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries, income taxes and

12 PART II. Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act, as controls and other
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  In connection with our year end close
process and the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective at December 31, 2004, except for the
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting noted below.  Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting defined in
Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, using the criteria set
forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control Integrated Framework. As part of this assessment, management evaluated the controls over the process for estimating the net
realizable value of accounts receivable and net revenue and concluded that a material weakness existed in these controls. Management concluded that the procedures for comparing cash collections to gross charges were inadequate. We use these
procedures to estimate contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts. The effect of this was to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross accounts receivable to their net realizable amounts. Consequently, we recorded an
increase in contractual adjustments of $91 million and a corresponding decrease in service fee revenue and accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of 2004, after year-end, in connection with our financial close process for the year ended December
31, 2004. Because of this material weakness, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2004.  Managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, has
been audited by Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also audited the Companys consolidated financial statements. Ernst Youngs attestation report on managements assessment of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting appears on page 40 hereof.  Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting  During the fourth quarter of 2004, management recognized the need to improve its methodology to match cash collections to billed charges which is used to reasonably estimate contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts in
order to reduce gross revenue billed charges and gross accounts receivable to their net realizable amounts. We were unable to complete remediation of this weakness before the end of the fourth quarter, and we made no changes to internal control
over financial reporting that materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter. Instead, we conducted additional procedures to enable us to assure the
accuracy of the financial statements for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 contained in this Form 10-K.  After year end, management finalized and placed into operation new controls to address the material weakness described above. The Companys new
controls include a retrospective collection analysis, that matches cash collections to billed charges by month of service, and is an enhancement to our methodology for estimating the amount of contractual adjustments and provision for doubtful
accounts. Management believes that these new controls have remediated the material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting that existed as of December 31, 2004, and that these internal controls are effective at the
reasonable assurance level. However, since these changes were implemented after year end, these changes did not alter the conclusion of management that our internal controls were not effective at year end.
