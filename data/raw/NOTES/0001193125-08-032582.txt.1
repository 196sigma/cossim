MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management of Marriott International, Inc. the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that: 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the Companys
transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the preparation of the Companys annual consolidated financial statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting as of December28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO Framework. Managements
assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of December28, 2007, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was
effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included
in this report, has issued an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on the next page of this annual report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING To the Board of
Directors and Shareholders of Marriott International, Inc.: We have audited Marriott International, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Marriott
International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting - included in the accompanying
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we

reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Marriott International, Inc. maintained in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December28, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We also have

MARRIOTT INTERNATIONAL, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements present the results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows of Marriott International, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, we, us, or the Company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods, and the disclosures of contingent liabilities. Accordingly, ultimate results could differ from those
estimates. As a result of the discontinuation of our synthetic fuel business on November3, 2007, the balances and
activities of the synthetic fuel reportable segment have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. At the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, we adopted Statement of Position 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, SOP 04-2 as issued by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants. The American Resort Development Association, a timeshare trade association of which we are a member and the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC had communications regarding SOP 04-2 and the
income statement presentation of timeshare note securitization gains. As a result of those communications, we now classify Timeshare segment note securitization gains within our Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. Accordingly,
Timeshare sales and services revenue reflects Timeshare segment note securitization gains of $81 million and $77 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable totaling $69 million for 2005, are classified
within the Gains and other income caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We have reclassified
certain prior year amounts to conform to our 2007 presentation. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at fiscal year-end
2007 and fiscal year-end 2006 and the results of our operations and cash flows for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005. We have eliminated all material intercompany transactions and balances between entities consolidated in these financial statements.
Fiscal Year Our fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest to December31. Unless otherwise specified, each reference to a particular year means the fiscal year ended on the date shown in the following table, rather than the corresponding calendar

Revenue Recognition Our revenues include: 1base management and incentive management fees; 2franchise fees; 3revenues from lodging
properties and other businesses owned or leased by us; 4timeshare sales and services, which also includes resort rental revenue, interest income associated with our Loans to timeshare owners, and for 2006 and 2007, Timeshare
segment note securitization gains, as noted in the Basis of Presentation caption earlier; and 5cost reimbursements. Management fees comprise a base fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of hotels, and an incentive fee, which
is generally based on hotel profitability. Franchise fees comprise initial application fees and continuing royalties generated from our franchise programs, which permit the hotel owners and operators to use certain of our brand names. Cost
reimbursements include direct and indirect costs that are reimbursed to us by lodging properties that we manage or franchise. 
69 Table of Contents
Base Management and Incentive Management Fees: We recognize base management fees as revenue
when earned in accordance with the contract. In interim periods and at year-end, we recognize incentive management fees that would be due as if the contract were to terminate at that date, exclusive of any termination fees payable or receivable by
us. Franchise Fee Revenue: We recognize franchise fees as revenue in each accounting period as fees are earned from the
franchisee. Owned and Leased Units: We recognize room sales and revenues from other guest services for our owned and leased
units when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered. Timeshare and Fractional Intervals and Condominiums: We
recognize sales when: 1we have received a minimum of 10 percent of the purchase price; 2the purchasers period to cancel for a refund has expired; 3we deem the receivables to be collectible; and 4we have attained
certain minimum sales and construction levels. We defer all revenue using the deposit method for sales that do not meet all four of these criteria. For sales that do not qualify for full revenue recognition as the project has progressed beyond the
preliminary stages but has not yet reached completion, all revenue and profit are deferred and recognized in earnings using the percentage of completion method. Timeshare Residential Stand-Alone Structures: We recognize sales under the full accrual method of accounting when we receive our proceeds and transfer title at settlement. Cost Reimbursements: We recognize cost reimbursements from managed, franchised, and timeshare properties when we incur the related
reimbursable costs. Other Revenue includes third-party licensing fees, other branding fees, land rental income, and other
revenue. Ground Leases We are both the lessor and lessee of land under long-term operating leases, which include scheduled increases in minimum rents. We recognize these scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the initial
lease term. Real Estate Sales We account for the sales of real estate in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards FAS No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate FAS No66. We reduce gains
on sales of real estate by the maximum exposure to loss if we have continuing involvement with the property and do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. In sales transactions where we retain a management contract, the
terms and conditions of the management contract are generally comparable to the terms and conditions of the management contracts obtained directly with third-party owners in competitive bid processes. Profit Sharing Plan We contribute to a profit sharing plan for the benefit of employees meeting certain eligibility requirements and electing participation in the plan. Contributions are determined based on a specified percentage of salary deferrals by
participating employees. We recognized compensation costs from profit sharing of $107 million in 2007, $86 million in 2006, and $69 million in 2005. Self-Insurance Programs We are self-insured for certain levels of property,
liability, workers compensation and employee medical coverage. We accrue estimated costs of these self-insurance programs at the present value of projected settlements for known and incurred but not reported claims. We use a discount rate of
47 percent to determine the present value of the projected settlements, which we consider to be reasonable given our history of settled claims, including payment patterns and the fixed nature of the individual settlements. We are subject to a variety of assessments related to our insurance activities, including those by state guaranty funds and workers
compensation second-injury funds. Our liabilities recorded for assessments are reflected within the amounts shown in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on the self-insurance reserves line, are not discounted, and totaled $5 million for both year-end
2007 and year-end 2006. Our liability of $5 million as of year-end 2007 for assessments is expected to be paid by the end of 2008.

Marriott Rewards Marriott Rewards is our frequent guest loyalty program. Marriott Rewards members earn points based on their monetary spending at our
lodging operations, purchases of timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential products and, to a lesser degree, through participation in affiliated partners programs, such as those offered by airlines and credit card companies.
Points, which we track on members behalf, can be redeemed for stays at most of our lodging operations, airline tickets, airline frequent flyer program miles, rental cars, and a variety of other awards; however, points cannot be redeemed for
cash. We provide Marriott Rewards as a marketing program to participating properties. We charge the cost of operating the program, including the estimated cost of award redemption, to properties based on members qualifying expenditures.
We defer revenue received from managed, franchised, and Marriott-owned/leased hotels and program partners equal to the
fair value of our future redemption obligation. We determine the fair value of the future redemption obligation based on statistical formulas that project timing of future point redemption based on historical levels, including an estimate of the
breakage for points that will never be redeemed, and an estimate of the points that will eventually be redeemed. These judgment factors determine the required liability for outstanding points. Our management and franchise agreements require that we be reimbursed currently for the costs of operating the program, including
marketing, promotion, communication with, and performing member services for the Marriott Rewards members. Due to the requirement that hotels reimburse us for program operating costs as incurred, we receive and recognize the balance of the revenue
from properties in connection with the Marriott Rewards program at the time such costs are incurred and expensed. We recognize the component of revenue from program partners that corresponds to program maintenance services over the expected life of
the points awarded. Upon the redemption of points, we recognize as revenue the amounts previously deferred and recognize the corresponding expense relating to the costs of the awards redeemed. Our liability for the Marriott Rewards program was
$1,392 million at year-end 2007 and $1,231 million at year-end 2006. Guarantees We record a liability for the fair value of a guarantee on the date a guarantee is issued or modified. The offsetting entry depends on the
circumstances in which the guarantee was issued. Funding under the guarantee reduces the recorded liability. When no funding is forecasted, the liability is amortized into income on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the guarantee.
Rebates and Allowances We participate in various vendor rebate and allowance arrangements as a manager of hotel properties. There are three types of programs that are common in the hotel industry that are sometimes referred to as
rebates or allowances, including unrestricted rebates, marketing restricted rebates and sponsorships. The primary business purpose of these arrangements is to secure favorable pricing for our hotel owners for various
products and services or enhance resources for promotional campaigns co-sponsored by certain vendors. More specifically, unrestricted rebates are funds returned to the buyer, generally based upon volumes or quantities of goods purchased. Marketing
restricted allowances are funds allocated by vendor agreements for certain marketing or other joint promotional initiatives. Sponsorships are funds paid by vendors, generally used by the vendor to gain exposure at meetings and events, which are
accounted for as a reduction of the cost of the event. We account for rebates and allowances as adjustments of the prices
of the vendors products and services. We show vendor costs and the reimbursement of those costs as reimbursed costs and cost reimbursements revenue, respectively; therefore, rebates are reflected as a reduction of these line items. 
Cash and Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash Restricted cash, totaling $153 million and $117 million at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006,
respectively, is recorded in the Other long-term assets line in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Restricted cash primarily consists of deposits received on timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential sales that
are held in escrow until the contract is closed. 
71 Table of Contents
Assets Held for Sale We consider properties other than Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products, which we classify as
inventory to be assets held for sale when all of the following criteria are met:  management commits to a plan to sell a property;  it is unlikely that the disposal plan will be significantly modified or discontinued;  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  actions required to complete the sale of the property have been initiated;  sale of the property is probable and we expect the completed sale will occur within one year; and  the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable given its current market value. Upon designation as an asset held for sale, we record the carrying value of each property at the lower of its carrying value or its
estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and we cease depreciation. Assets held for sale totaled $123 million
at year-end 2007 and consisted of property and equipment. The $123 million total reflected the following segment composition: North American Full-Service-$17 million; North American Limited-Service-$17 million; and Luxury-$89 million. There were no
liabilities of assets held for sale at year-end 2007. Assets held for sale totaled $411 million at year-end 2006 and
consisted of property and equipment of $391 million, accounts receivable of $10 million, cash of $6 million, and other assets of $4 million. The $411 million total reflected the following segment composition: International Lodging-$295 million;
Luxury Lodging-$73 million; and North American Full-Service Lodging-$43 million. Liabilities of assets held for sale totaled $102 million at year-end 2006 and consisted of debt totaling $81 million, accounts payable of $11 million, accrued payroll
and benefits of $8 million, and other payables and accruals of $2 million. In 2007 we reclassified the balances associated
with one property, in conformity with other held and used properties, as the property no longer satisfied the criteria to be classified as held for sale. In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation
expense of $4 million in 2007 that would have been recognized in 2006 and $4 million in late 2007 that would have been recognized earlier in 2007 had the asset been continuously classified as held and used. Loan Loss Reserves Lodging
Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans We measure loan impairment based on the present value of
expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or the estimated fair value of the collateral. For impaired loans, we establish a specific impairment reserve for the difference between the recorded
investment in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated fair value of the collateral. We apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose
of applying such policy. For loans that we have determined to be impaired, we recognize interest income on a cash basis. Loans to
Timeshare Owners We record an estimate of expected uncollectibility on notes receivable that we receive from
timeshare purchasers as a reduction of revenue at the time we recognize profit on a timeshare sale. We assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables because we hold large numbers of homogeneous timeshare notes receivable. We estimate
uncollectibles based on historical activity for similar timeshare notes receivable over the past three years. We use a technique referred to as static pool analysis, which tracks uncollectibles for each years sales over the life of those
notes. Valuation of Goodwill We evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the
asset. We evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections that assume certain growth projections which may or may not occur. We record an impairment loss for
goodwill when the carrying value of the intangible asset is less than its estimated fair value. 
72 Table of Contents
Investments We consolidate entities that we control. We account for investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting when we
exercise significant influence over the venture. If we do not exercise significant influence, we account for the investment using the cost method of accounting. We account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies using
the equity method of accounting when we own more than a minimal investment. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments varies generally from 10 percent to 50 percent. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities totaled $55 million and $107 million at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006,
respectively. We included net unrealized holding gains on available-for-sale securities of $9 million at year-end 2007 and $35 million at year-end 2006 in accumulated other comprehensive income. The amount of net gains reclassified out of
accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the sale of available-for-sale securities totaled $18 million and zero for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We determined the cost basis of the securities sold using specific identification.
Costs Incurred to Sell Real Estate Projects We charge the majority of sales and marketing costs we incur to sell timeshares to expense when incurred. Selling and marketing costs
capitalized were $6 million at year-end 2007 and $16 million at year-end 2006 and are included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in the Other caption within the Current assets section. If a contract is canceled,
we charge unrecoverable direct selling and marketing costs to expense and record deposits forfeited as income. Residual Interests 
We periodically sell notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval
and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests.
The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. Prior to the start of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their
allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities FAS
No115, and recorded those assets at amortized cost. On December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Statement No140 FAS No156. FAS No156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. It also
allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and liabilities. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under
the fair value method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in
earnings in the period in which the change occurs. For additional information regarding the adoption of FAS No156, see Footnote No11, Asset Securitizations. We treat the residual interests, including servicing assets, as trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115.
At the dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. We report changes in the fair values of these residual interests,
including servicing assets, through the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The rate of prepayment of loans
serviced is the most significant estimate involved in the measurement process. Estimates of prepayment rates are based on managements expectations of future prepayment rates, reflecting our historical rate of loan repayments, industry trends,
and other considerations. Actual prepayment rates differ from those projected by management due to changes in a variety of economic factors, including prevailing interest rates and the availability of alternative financing sources to borrowers. If
actual prepayments of the loans being serviced were to occur more slowly than had been projected, the carrying value of servicing assets could increase, and servicing income would exceed previously projected amounts. Accordingly, the servicing
assets actually realized, could differ from the amounts initially recorded. Derivative Instruments We use derivative instruments as part of our overall strategy to manage our exposure to market risks associated with fluctuations in
interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As a matter of policy, we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
73 Table of Contents
We record all derivatives at fair value either as assets or liabilities. We recognize,
currently in earnings, changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and of derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments. We record changes in the fair value of the hedged item in a fair value hedge as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognize the change in the fair value of the derivative in earnings in the same income statement line item. We record the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments as a component of
other comprehensive income and report the ineffective portion currently in earnings. We reclassify amounts included in other comprehensive income into earnings in the same period during which the hedged item affects earnings. Foreign Operations The U.S. dollar is the functional currency of our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating in the United States. The functional currency for our consolidated and unconsolidated entities operating outside of the United States is
generally the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and expends cash. We translate the financial statements of consolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars,
and we do the same, as needed, for unconsolidated entities whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We translate assets and liabilities at the exchange rate in effect as of the financial statement date and translate income statement
accounts using the weighted average exchange rate for the period. We include translation adjustments from foreign exchange and the effect of exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature as a separate component
of shareholders equity. We report gains and losses from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long-term investment nature, as well as gains and losses from foreign currency
transactions, currently in operating costs and expenses, and those amounted to a $2 million loss in 2007, a $6 million gain in 2006, and a $5 million loss in 2005. Gains and other income for 2007 included $6 million attributable to currency
translation adjustment gains, net of losses, from the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of investments. There were no similar gains or losses in 2006 or 2005. New Accounting Standards FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes We adopted FASB Interpretation
No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, FIN 48 on December30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FIN 48 is an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, which seeks to standardize practices associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement
recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Under FIN 48,
an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FIN 48 of $155 million as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. See Footnote No3, Income Taxes, for additional information. Financial Accounting Standards No156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets-an Amendment of FASB Statement No140
We adopted FASBs FAS No156 on December30, 2006, the first day of our 2007 fiscal year. FAS
No156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities initially be measured at fair value, if practicable. It also allows an entity to subsequently elect fair value measurement for its servicing assets and
liabilities. We recorded the cumulative effect of applying FAS No156, of $1 million, net of tax, as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on December30, 2006. See Footnote No11, Asset
Securitizations, for additional information. Future Adoption of Accounting Standards EITF Issue No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for
Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force of FASB
EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No06-8, Applicability of the Assessment of a Buyers Continuing Investment under FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, for Sales of Condominiums
EITF 06-8. EITF 06-8 will require condominium sales to meet the continuing investment criterion in FAS No66 in order to recognize profit under the 
74 Table of Contents
percentage of completion method. EITF 06-8 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after March15, 2007, which for us begins with our
2008 fiscal year. The cumulative effect of applying EITF 06-8, if any, will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We do not expect the impact of adoption of EITF 06-8 to be material.
Financial Accounting Standards No157, Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the FASB issued FAS No157, Fair Value Measurements FAS No157. This standard
defines fair value, establishes a methodology for measuring fair value, and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements. FAS No157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, which for us begins with
our 2008 fiscal year. Provisions of FAS No157 must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the first fiscal year in which FAS No157 is applied. In November 2007, the FASB agreed to partially defer the effective date, for one
year, of FAS No157, for non-financial assets and liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No157 will have
on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS
No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 FAS No159. This standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after November15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect to elect the fair value measurement option for any
financial assets or liabilities at the present time. EITF Issue No07-6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to
the Requirements of FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause In December 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue No07-6, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate Subject to the
Requirements of FASB Statement No66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, When the Agreement Includes a Buy-Sell Clause EITF 07-6. EITF 07-6 clarifies whether a buy-sell clause is a prohibited form of
continuing involvement that would preclude partial sales treatment under FAS No66. EITF 07-6 is effective for new arrangements entered into and assessments of existing transactions originally accounted for under the deposit, profit-sharing,
leasing, or financing methods for reasons other than the exercise of a buy-sell clause performed in fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007, which for us begins with our 2008 fiscal year. We do not expect EITF 07-6 to have a material
impact on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations
On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No141 Revised 2007, Business Combinations
FAS No141R. FAS No141R will significantly change the accounting for business combinations. Under FAS No141R, an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. FAS No141R also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. FAS No141R applies prospectively to business combinations for which the
acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No141R will have
on our financial statements. Financial Accounting Standards No160, Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements-an Amendment of ARB No. 51 On December4, 2007, the FASB issued FAS No160,
Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements-an Amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No51 FAS No160. FAS No160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards
for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a non-controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements
separate from the parents equity. The amount of net income attributable to the non-controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement. FAS No160 clarifies that changes in a parents
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest. In addition, this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when
a subsidiary is deconsolidated. Such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non-controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date. FAS No160 also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of
the 
75 Table of Contents
parent and its non-controlling interest. FAS No160 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after
December15, 2008, which for us begins with our 2009 fiscal year. We are currently evaluating the impact that FAS No160 will have on our financial statements.  2.
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Our
synthetic fuel operations consisted of four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities the Facilities. Because tax credits under Section45K of the Internal Revenue Code are not available for the production and sale of
synthetic fuel produced from coal after calendar year-end 2007, and because high oil prices during 2007 will result in the phase-out of a significant portion of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in 2007, on
November3, 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel. Accordingly, we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation. The book value of the Facilities was zero at year-end 2007, as the
Facilities have been transferred to third parties. Under the site leases for the Facilities, we were required to restore the leased premises to substantially the condition the premises were in when the leases were originally executed. However, we
executed agreements with the lessors of the sites pursuant to which we transferred the Facilities to the lessors in exchange for the release of our obligations to restore the leased premises to their original condition. Costs associated with
shutting down the synthetic fuel operation and transferring the Facilities to the site lessors were not material. The
following table provides additional income statement and balance sheet information relating to the discontinued operations: Income

INCOME TAXES We adopted the
provisions of FIN 48, on December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recorded a $155 million increase in the net liability for unrecognized tax positions, which was recorded as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings and additional paid-in-capital on December30, 2006. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of year-end 2007 was $132 million. Included in the balance at year-end 2007 were $97
million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. As a large taxpayer, we are under continual audit by the Internal Revenue Service IRS and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions, and it
is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change during the next 52-week period. While it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year, it is not anticipated that a
significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur.

penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. This policy did not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December28, 2007, and our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of that date include interest of $18 million and $8 million, respectively. We file income tax returns,
including returns for our subsidiaries, with federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Program CAP for the 2006 and 2007 tax years and we intend to participate for 2008. This program
accelerates the examination of key transactions with the goal of resolving any issues before the tax return is filed. Our 2005 federal income tax return is currently being examined by the IRS in a traditional audit process. In June 2007, we received
IRS Revenue Agents Reports for both the 2000 through 2002 and 2003 through 2004 examination cycles. We have fully resolved all issues and are in the final stages of closing these years. Various state, local, and foreign income tax returns are also
under examination by taxing authorities. We do not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on our financial statements. As disclosed in our 2006 Form 10-K, the IRS was then auditing the Companys federal tax returns for the 2000, 2001, and 2002 fiscal years. As part of that audit, the IRS reviewed a leveraged employee stock
ownership plan ESOP feature of the Companys Employees Profit Sharing, Retirement and Savings Plan the Plan that was implemented in a transaction the ESOP transaction on June13, 2000.
Principal and interest on the debt related to the transaction was forgiven over a 26-month period as a mechanism for funding Company contributions of elective deferrals and matching contributions to the Plan. We claimed federal income tax deductions
for the forgiven principal on the debt in the amount of $1 billion over that period, along with forgiven interest on the debt. The benefit related to the tax deductions was reflected in equity and did not flow through the provision for income taxes.
On June7, 2007, we reached a settlement of issues raised during the IRS and Department of Labors
examination of the ESOP feature of the Plan. The settlement resulted in an after-tax charge in the 2007 second quarter totaling $54 million and a reduction in shareholders equity of $115 million. The $54 million charge included $35 million of
excise taxes impacting general, administrative, and other expense, $13 million of interest expense on those excise taxes, and $6 million of income tax expense primarily reflecting additional interest. As a result of the settlement, we have made
cash payments to the U.S. Treasury and state tax jurisdictions of $205 million through year-end 2007. The remaining cash payments of approximately $1 million are expected to be made in 2008. The payments reflect income taxes, excise taxes, and
interest charges. No penalties were assessed. Total deferred tax assets and liabilities as of year-end 2007 and year-end
2006, were as follows:  in millions

through 2027, $226 million of tax credits that do not expire, and $656 million of net operating losses, of which $360 million expire through 2027. The valuation allowance decreased due to foreign net operating losses that we believe will be realized
and the expiration of state net operating losses. We have made no provision for U.S. income taxes or additional foreign
taxes on the cumulative unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries $738 million as of year-end 2007 because we consider these earnings to be permanently invested. These earnings could become subject to additional taxes if remitted as dividends,
loaned to us or a U.S. affiliate or if we sold our interests in the affiliates. We cannot practically estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on the unremitted earnings. We conduct business in countries that grant a
holiday from income taxes for 10- and 30-year periods. The holidays expire through 2034. The aggregate amount of taxes not incurred due to tax holidays and the related earnings per share impacts are $22 million $006 per
diluted share, $22 million $005 per diluted share, and $11 million $002 per diluted share for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The provision for benefit from income taxes consists of:  $ in millions

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION Under our
2002 Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan the Comprehensive Plan, we award: 1stock options to purchase our ClassA Common Stock Stock Option Program; 2share appreciation rights for our
ClassA Common Stock; 3restricted stock units of our ClassA Common Stock; and 4deferred stock units. We grant awards at exercise prices or strike prices that are equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock
on the date of grant. We adopted FAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method at the beginning of
our 2006 first quarter. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, we did not restate our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods to reflect the impact of FAS No123R. For all share-based awards granted after
the date we adopted FAS No123R and for the unvested portion of previously granted share-based awards that were outstanding on that date, FAS No123R requires that we measure compensation costs related to our share-based payment
transactions at fair value on the grant date and that we recognize those costs in the financial statements over the vesting period during which the employee provides service in exchange for the award. Previously, under FAS No123 and APB
Opinion No25, we accounted for our share-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No25 and recognized share-based compensation expense for all
awards except for our Stock Option Program awards. We recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $62 million in 2005. Under FAS No123R, we recorded share-based compensation expense related to award grants of $104 million in 2007 and $108 million in 2006. Deferred compensation costs related to unvested awards totaled $162
million at year-end 2007 and $168 million at year-end 2006, and the weighted average period over which we expect the deferred compensation costs at year-end 2007 to be recognized is two years.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if we
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS No123 to share-based employee compensation in 2005. We have included the impact of measured but unrecognized compensation costs and excess tax benefits credited to additional
paid-in-capital in the calculation of diluted pro forma shares. In addition, we have included the estimated impact of reimbursements from third parties. The reported and pro forma net income and earnings per share figures for 2007 and 2006 in the
table are the same because we calculate share-based compensation expense under the provisions of FAS No123R. We have included the 2007 and 2006 amounts in the table below to provide detail for comparative purposes to the 2005 amounts.

over the period from the grant date to the date on which the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service the substantive vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we showed
share-based compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure only for option awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period. In periods prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we recorded share-based
compensation expense for our other awards to retirement-eligible employees over the awards stated vesting period. With the adoption of FAS No123R, we continue to follow the stated vesting period for the unvested portion of awards
granted prior to adoption of FAS No123R and follow the substantive vesting period for awards granted after the adoption of FAS No123R. In accordance with FAS No123R, we present the tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as financing cash flows. Prior to the adoption of FAS No123R, we reported the tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of share-based awards as operating cash flows. Tax benefits resulting from the exercise of share-based awards totaled $115 million, $194 million, and $87 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The aggregate amount of cash we received from the exercise of stock options granted under share-based payment arrangements was $89
million, $184 million, and $125 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We issue restricted stock units under the
Comprehensive Plan to certain officers and key employees and those units vest generally over four years in annual installments commencing one year after the date of grant. We recognize compensation expense for the restricted stock units over the
service period equal to the fair market value of the stock units on the date of issuance. Upon vesting, restricted stock units convert to shares and are distributed from treasury shares. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, we had approximately $145
million and $138 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to restricted stock units. Share-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units was $82 million, $77 million, and $52 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. The weighted average remaining term for restricted stock unit grants outstanding at year-end 2007 was two years. Restricted stock units converted and distributed during 2007, 2006, and 2005, had aggregate intrinsic values of $147
million, $78 million, and $52 million, respectively. The weighted average grant-date fair values of restricted stock units granted in 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $49, $35, and $32, respectively.

the date of the grant. Most stock options under the Stock Option Program are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of the first four years following the date of grant. We recognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options of $12 million in 2007 and $22 million in 2006. We did not
recognize any compensation expense associated with employee stock options in 2005. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $6 million and $18 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to employee stock
options. Upon the exercise of stock options, we issue shares from treasury shares. Changes in our outstanding Stock Option

6 The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 33,000 options granted in 2007
was $19 and the options had a weighted average exercise price of $49. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the 24,000 options granted in 2006 was $13 and the options had a weighted average exercise price of $34. The total intrinsic value of
options outstanding at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was $1,279 million and $1,368 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value for stock options exercisable as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was $624 million and $1,233 million,
respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $206 million, $309 million, and $173 million, respectively. Employee share appreciation rights Employee SARs may be granted to officers and key employees at exercise prices or strike
prices equal to the market price of our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee SARs expire 10 years after the date of grant and generally both vest and are exercisable in cumulative installments of one quarter at the end of each of
the first four years following the date of grant. Non-employee share appreciation rights Non-employee SARs may be granted to directors at exercise prices or strike prices equal to the market price of 
81 Table of Contents
our ClassA Common Stock on the date of grant. Non-employee SARs expire 10 years after the date of grant and vest upon grant; however, they are
generally not exercisable until one year after grant. We first began issuing share appreciation rights in 2006. On exercise of SARs, employees or Non-employee directors receive the number of shares of ClassA Common Stock equal to the number of
share appreciation rights that are being exercised multiplied by the quotient of athe final value minus the base value, divided by bthe final value. We recognized compensation expense associated with Employee SARs and Non-employee SARs of $5 million in 2007 and $3 million in 2006. At
the end of 2007 and 2006, we had approximately $7 million and $4 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to share appreciation rights. Upon the exercise of share appreciation rights, shares are issued from treasury shares.
During 2007 and 2006, we granted 04million and 05million, respectively, Employee SARs with a weighted average base value of $49 and $34, respectively, and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $19 and $13, respectively. During
2007 and 2006, we also granted 4,000 and 8,000, respectively, Non-employee SARs with a weighted average base value of $46 and $37, respectively, and a weighted average grant-date fair value of $20 and $18, respectively. No SARs have expired or been
forfeited in 2007. The total intrinsic value of SARs outstanding at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 was zero and $7 million, respectively, and the total intrinsic value of SARs exercisable as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 were each zero. The
total intrinsic value of SARs exercised during 2007 was $100,000. No SARs were exercised in 2006. We use a binomial method
to estimate the fair value of each stock option or SAR granted. The assumptions for stock options for all years and employee SARs for 2007 and 2006 are noted in the following table:  2007 2006 2005 Annual dividends 029 022 018 Expected volatility 28 30 30 Risk-free interest rate 48 45 41 Expected life in years 7 7 8
For Non-employee SARs issued in 2007 and 2006, the only differences in the
assumptions versus employee SARs were the use of risk-free interest rates of 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively, and for each years issuances, an expected life of 10 years. Estimated volatilities for 2007 and 2006 were based on the historical share-price volatility for a period equal to the stock
options or share appreciation rights expected lives, ending on the day of grant, and calculated based on weekly data. The weighted average expected stock option or share appreciation right terms for 2007 and 2006 were a product of the
lattice-based binomial valuation model that uses suboptimal exercise factors to calculate the expected terms. We also
issue deferred stock units to Non-employee directors. These Non-employee director deferred stock units vest within one year and are distributed upon election. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $227,000 and $152,000,
respectively, in deferred costs related to Non-employee director deferred stock units. We recognized share-based expense associated with Non-employee director deferred stock units of $666,000, $492,000, and $416,000 for 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively. During 2007 we granted 20,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $46. For 2006 and 2005, we granted 18,000 and 21,000 Non-employee director deferred stock units with weighted
average grant-date fair values of $37 and $32, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of Non-employee director deferred stock units distributed during 2007, 2006, and 2005, was $03 million, $17 million, and $02 million, respectively. At
year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there were 218,000 and 203,000, respectively, Non-employee deferred stock units outstanding, and the weighted average grant-date fair value of those outstanding deferred stock units was $24 and $21, respectively.
Although the Comprehensive Plan also provides for issuance of deferred stock bonus awards, deferred stock awards, and
restricted stock awards, our Compensation Policy Committee indefinitely suspended the issuance of deferred bonus stock commencing with our 2001 fiscal year and the issuance of both deferred stock awards and restricted stock awards commencing with
the 2003 fiscal year. At year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, there was approximately $4 million and $8 million, respectively, in deferred compensation costs related to these suspended award programs, and the weighted average remaining term was two
years for such award grants outstanding at year-end 2007. Share-based compensation expense associated with these suspended award programs was $4 million, $6 million, and $10 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. At year-end 2007, 63million shares were reserved under the Comprehensive Plan including 39million shares under the Stock
Option Program and Share Appreciation Right Program.

with FAS No128, Earnings per Share, we have not included the following stock options and SARs in our calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices were greater than the average market prices for the
applicable periods:  a

INVENTORY Inventory, totaling
$1,557 million and $1,186 million as of December28, 2007, and December29, 2006, respectively, consists primarily of Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products totaling $1,536 million and $1,166 million as
of December28, 2007, and December29, 2006, respectively. Inventory totaling $21 million and $20 million as of December28, 2007, and December29, 2006, respectively, relates to hotel operating supplies for the limited number of
properties we own or lease. We value Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products at the lower of cost or net realizable value and generally value operating supplies at the lower of cost using the first-in, first-out
method or market. Consistent with recognized industry practice, we classify Timeshare segment interval, fractional ownership, and residential products inventory, which has an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months, as a current asset.

estate taxes incurred during development and construction. Interest capitalized as a cost of property and equipment totaled $49 million in 2007, $32 million in 2006, and $30 million in 2005. We capitalize the cost of improvements that extend the
useful life of property and equipment when incurred. These capitalized costs may include structural costs, equipment, fixtures, floor, and wall coverings. We expense all repair and maintenance costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets three to 40 years, and we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the asset life or lease term. Depreciation expense totaled $162 million in 2007, $155 million in 2006,
and $156 million in 2005.  8.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS 2007 Acquisitions
During 2007, we acquired one full-service property, one limited-service property, and one extended-stay property for
cash consideration of $199 million. These three properties were acquired in conjunction with a land assemblage for a large hotel complex that is still in the formative development stage. In addition, we acquired certain land parcels in 2007 for cash
consideration of $52 million. Also during 2007, we acquired the fee simple interest in the improvements of three properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties for cash consideration of $58 million. The purchase
included one full-service property and two limited-service properties, which were each sold later in the same year. During
the first half of 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional ownership and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partners interest in the joint venture for $6 million. In conjunction
with that transaction, we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $90 million and $84 million, respectively, on the date of the purchase. During the first half of 2007, we were party to another venture that was established to develop and market
timeshare and residential interests. In the second half of 2007, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture, and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land and assets from our partner as well. Aggregate cash
and notes payable issued for these transactions totaled $106 million, and we acquired assets and liabilities totaling $182 million and $76 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. At year-end 2007, we were party to a venture that developed and marketed fractional and whole ownership interests. Subsequent to year-end
2007, we purchased our partners interest in that joint venture and concurrent with this transaction, we purchased additional land from our partner as well. Cash consideration for this transaction totaled $37 million and we acquired assets and
liabilities totaling $74 million and $37 million, respectively, on the date of purchase. 2007 Dispositions In 2007, we sold nine properties for cash proceeds of $601 million and recognized gains totaling $24 million. We continue to operate eight
of the nine properties under long-term agreements. We sold two parcels of land for $55 million in cash proceeds that were under development and recognized a gain of $2 million. We also sold the fee simple interest in the improvements of three
properties and the leasehold interest in the ground underlying the three properties, initially acquired in early 2007, for book value and received $58 million in cash proceeds. We continue to manage the properties under long-term agreements. Each of
the aforementioned sales was accounted for under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66. During the year, we also sold our interests in five joint ventures for cash proceeds of $30 million and recognized gains totaling $13
million. We had other asset sales during the year, which generated proceeds totaling $1 million. Cash flows totaling $745 million for all the preceding dispositions in 2007 are reflected in the Dispositions line in our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows. 
84 Table of Contents
In 2007, we also sold land that was under development. Due to a contingency in the sales
contract, this sale was accounted for under the deposit method of FAS No66. Accordingly, the cash proceeds, totaling $90 million, were reflected in Other investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
2006 Acquisitions During 2006, we acquired one full-service property for $130 million including aggregate cash consideration of $46 million plus the assumption of debt. In addition we acquired three other full-service properties for
aggregate cash consideration of $134 million. We sold each of the four properties to third-party owners during the 2007 fiscal year. 2006 Dispositions In 2006 we sold our interest in the 50/50 joint venture with Whitbread PLC
Whitbread, which held 46 hotels consisting of more than 8,000 rooms and we received approximately $164 million in cash, net of transaction costs, which was approximately equal to the investments book value. We continue to manage
the hotels under the Marriott Hotels Resorts and Renaissance Hotels Resorts brands. We also sold our minority interest in five other joint ventures during 2006 for cash proceeds of $64 million and recognized gains of $43
million. Additionally, one cost method investee redeemed the preferred stock we held for $81 million in cash consideration and we recognized income of $25 million on the redemption. During 2006 we also sold 10 full-service properties for cash proceeds of $487 million and recognized gains totaling $14 million.
We accounted for each of the sales under the full accrual method in accordance with FAS No66 and will continue to operate eight of the properties under long-term management agreements. The sold properties included eight properties
purchased in 2005 from CTF Holdings Ltd. and certain of its affiliates collectively CTF. For additional information regarding the CTF transaction, see the 2005 Acquisitions caption later in this footnote. Prior to the sale
of one property, balances associated with that property were reclassified in conformity with other held and used properties, in the first half of 2006 as the property was not expected to be sold, within one year of its classification as
held for sale. In conjunction with that reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $2 million in the first half of 2006 that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used.
Cash proceeds of $26 million for one hotel sold in 2006 are not reflected in the disposition proceeds of $487 million as the proceeds were initially recorded as a deposit because of a contingency and impacted the Other investing
activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows rather than Dispositions. The contingency was subsequently resolved and sale accounting was achieved in 2006. Other asset sales generated cash proceeds of $2 million.
Late in 2006, we sold a 75 percent interest in a joint venture to a third party for its book value of $14 million. At the
time of the sale, the joint ventures only asset was a parcel of land. In conjunction with the sale, we made a $25 million bridge loan to the joint venture, which matured in early 2007. Following the guidance found in EITF 98-8,
Accounting for Transfers of Investments That Are in Substance Real Estate, and FAS No66 due to our continuing involvement with the joint venture, we consolidated the joint venture for the period of time that the bridge loan was
outstanding. Subsequent to the bridge loans repayment, we account for our remaining interest in the joint venture under the equity method as required by APB Opinion No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common
Stock. In 1988, the Company as landlord, entered into a 59-year ground lease with a lessee for land that was
improved with a hotel that is owned by the lessee. The hotel was previously branded a Marriott property. The lease contained contractual rental increases over the term of the lease and annual ground rent on the land totaled approximately $5 million
in 2006. The lease also contained a provision that permitted the lessee, under certain circumstances, to purchase the land for a fixed price. We and the lessee had various discussions in 2006 concerning the land as well as the hotel. During the 2006
second quarter, it became probable that none of the proposed transactions were acceptable to both parties and the lessee indicated its intent to exercise its option to purchase the land. Accordingly, in the 2006 second quarter, we reclassified the
land from the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets to the Assets held for sale caption and recorded a $37 million non-cash charge to adjust the carrying amount to net realizable value. We
completed the sale of the land, at book value, to the lessee in 2007 and this transaction is reflected in the figures noted earlier for dispositions in 2007. 2005 Acquisitions During the third quarter of 2005, we purchased from CTF and
certain of its affiliates 13 properties in each case through a purchase of real estate, a purchase of the entity that owned the hotel, or an assignment of CTFs leasehold rights and certain joint venture interests from CTF for an aggregate
price of $381 million. Prior to the sale, all of the properties were operated by us or our subsidiaries. 
85 Table of Contents
At the purchase date, we planned to sell eight of the properties to third-party owners
and the balances related to these full-service properties were classified within the Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held for sale captions in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2005. All eight
properties were sold in 2006. One operating lease terminated in 2005. At the purchase date we operated four remaining properties under leases, three of which expire by 2012. Under the purchase and sale agreement we signed with CTF in the second
quarter of 2005, we were obligated to purchase two additional properties for $17 million, the acquisition of which was postponed pending receipt of certain third-party consents. We did not purchase these additional two properties and the obligation
expired. On the closing date we and CTF also modified management agreements on 29 other CTF-leased hotels, 28 located in
Europe and one located in the United States. We became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain of these hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. At the closing date, we continued to manage 16 of these hotels
under new long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed approximately $89 million in trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in
cash flow necessary to meet rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF from its guarantees in connection with these leases. In 2007, the lease agreement associated with one of these properties was terminated. In 2007, we also entered
into a transaction whereby the landlord allowed us to assume the lease agreement for another of the properties for which we then became the primary obligor. In conjunction with becoming the primary obligor, we received a $16 million distribution
from the trust, and the balance of the funds was distributed to the landlord. We accounted for our receipt of trust funds as a lease incentive, the reduction of which will be recorded on a straight-line basis as an adjustment to lease expense over
the term expiring in 2033. At year-end 2007, approximately $38 million remained in these trust accounts for the 14 properties we still manage and account for as leases. Minimum lease payments relating to these leases are as follows: $30 million in
each of 2008, 2009, and 2010; $26 million in 2011; $17 million in 2012; and $33 million thereafter, for a total of $166 million. For 13 European leased hotels, of the 29 properties mentioned in the preceding paragraph, CTF may terminate management agreements with us if and when CTF obtains releases from landlords of our back-up guarantees. Pending completion of the
CTF-landlord agreements, we continue to manage these hotels under modified management agreements and remain secondarily liable under certain of these leases. We are also secondarily obligated for real estate taxes and other charges associated with
the leases. Third parties have severally indemnified us for all payments we may be required to make in connection with these obligations. Since we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not expect to fund any amounts
under these guarantees in the future. CTF had originally made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we were required to fund under such guarantees. At year-end 2007, we still managed five of the original 13 properties.
Approximately 7million $11 million of cash collateral remained available at year-end 2007. Our contingent liability exposure at year-end 2007 associated with the five remaining properties totaled $77 million as also noted in Footnote
No17, Contingencies. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these remaining hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure will decline. At the closing date, we continued to manage three other hotels in the United Kingdom under amended management agreements with CTF and
continued to manage 14 other properties in Asia on behalf of New World Development Company Limited and its affiliates. CTFs principals are officers, directors, and stockholders of New World Development Company Limited. At the closing date, the
owners of the United Kingdom and Asian hotels agreed to invest $17 million to renovate those properties. We and CTF also
exchanged legal releases effective as of the closing date and litigation and arbitration that was outstanding between the two companies and their affiliates was dismissed. Simultaneously with the closing on the foregoing transactions, CTF also sold five properties and one minority joint venture interest to
Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. Sunstone for $419 million, eight properties to Walton Street Capital, L.L.C. Walton Street for $578 million, and two properties to Tarsadia Hotels Tarsadia for $29 million, in
each case as substitute purchasers under our purchase and sale agreement with CTF. Prior to consummation of the sales, we also operated all of these properties. At closing, Walton Street and Sunstone entered into new long-term management agreements
with us and agreed to invest a combined $68 million to further upgrade the 13 properties they acquired. At the closing date, the two properties purchased by Tarsadia were operated under short-term management and franchise agreements. 
86 Table of Contents
When we signed the purchase and sale agreement for the foregoing transactions in the 2005
second quarter, we recorded a $94 million pretax charge primarily due to the non-cash write-off of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the termination of the existing management agreements for properties involved in these
transactions. As described above, we entered into new long-term management agreements with CTF, Walton Street, and Sunstone at the closing of the transactions. In 2005 we also purchased two full-service properties, one in Paris, France and the other in Munich, Germany, for aggregate cash
consideration of $146 million. We planned to sell these two full-service properties to third-party owners and the balances related to these properties were classified within the Assets held for sale and Liabilities of assets held
for sale line items on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2005. The property in Paris, France, was sold in 2006 and the property located in Munich, Germany, was sold in 2007. The balances associated with the Munich, Germany, property
were reclassified, in conformity with other held and used properties in the 2006 fourth quarter as the property was not sold at that time, as expected, within one year of its classification as held for sale. In conjunction
with the 2006 reclassification, we recorded depreciation expense of $5 million in the 2006 fourth quarter that would have been recognized had the asset been continuously classified as held and used.  2005 Dispositions Late in 2005, we contributed land underlying an additional nine Courtyard hotels, worth approximately $40 million, to CBM Land Joint Venture limited partnership CBM Land JV, a joint venture the majority of which was owned, at
the time of the transaction, by a third party on behalf of an institutional investor, thereby obtaining a 23 percent equity stake in CBM Land JV. At the same time we completed the sale of a portfolio of land underlying 75 Courtyard by Marriott
hotels for approximately $246 million in cash to CBM Land JV. In conjunction with this transaction, we recognized a gain of $17 million in 2005, we deferred recognition of a $5 million gain due to our minority interest in the joint venture, and we
also deferred recognition of a $40 million gain due to contingencies in the transaction documents. As those contingencies expire in subsequent years, we will recognize additional gains. In each of 2007 and 2006, we recognized gains of $4 million,
and at year-end 2007, the aggregate remaining deferred gains totaled $37 million. We also sold a number of other land
parcels in 2005 for $38 million in cash, net of transaction costs and recognized gains totaling $6 million, and we sold two minority interests in joint ventures for $14 million in cash and recognized gains totaling $7 million.  9.

provisions of FAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Amortization expense totaled $35 million in 2007, $33 million in 2006, and $28 million in 2005. Estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five
fiscal years is as follows: $29 million for 2008; $26 million for 2009; $26 million for 2010; $25 million for 2011; and $25 million for 2012.

Accounts and notes receivable in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, including $68 million and $70 million, as of year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, respectively, related to Loans to timeshare owners. Our notes receivable are due as follows: 2008-$89 million; 2009-$51 million; 2010-$134 million; 2011-$58 million; 2012-$57 million; and
$300 million thereafter. The 2007 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $25 million and the 2006 notes receivable balance is net of unamortized discounts totaling $28 million. Gains from the sale of notes receivable
totaled approximately $82 million, $79 million, and $94 million during 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Lodging
Senior Loans and Lodging Mezzanine and Other Loans Interest income associated with Lodging senior loans and
Lodging mezzanine and other loans is reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the Interest income caption. We do not accrue interest on Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine
and other loans that are impaired. At year-end 2007, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other loans was $112 million and we had a $92 million allowance for credit losses,
leaving $20 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. At year-end 2006, our recorded investment in impaired Lodging senior loans and Lodging mezzanine and other
loans was $92 million and we had a $70 million allowance for credit losses, leaving $22 million of our investment in impaired loans for which there was no related allowance for credit losses. During 2007 and 2006, our average investment in

Loans to Timeshare Owners At year-end 2007, the weighted average interest rate for our Loans to timeshare owners was 127 percent and the stated
interest rates associated with these loans ranged from zero to 199 percent. We reflect interest income associated with Loans to timeshare owners of $50 million, $41 million, and $38 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income in the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption. We do not accrue interest on Loans to timeshare owners that are over 90 days past due. Our recorded investment in Loans
to timeshare owners on nonaccrual status at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 totaled $59 million and $67 million, respectively. We established the reserve for Loans to timeshare owners notes receivable in 2006 in conjunction with
the adoption of SOP 04-2. The following table summarizes the activity related to our Loans to timeshare owners

ASSET SECURITIZATIONS We
periodically sell, without recourse, through special purpose entities, notes receivable originated by our Timeshare segment in connection with the sale of timeshare interval and fractional products. We continue to service the notes and transfer all
proceeds collected to special purpose entities. We retain servicing assets and other interests in the notes and account for these assets and interests as residual interests. The interests are limited to the present value of cash available after
paying financing expenses and program fees and absorbing credit losses. Prior to the start of the 2007 fiscal year, we measured servicing assets at the date of sale at their allocated previous carrying amount based on relative fair value, classified
those assets as held to maturity under the provisions of FAS No115 and recorded those assets at amortized cost. On
December30, 2006, the first day of fiscal year 2007, we adopted FAS No156. In conjunction with the adoption of FAS No156, we elected to subsequently measure our servicing assets using the fair value method. Under the fair value
method, we carry servicing assets on the balance sheet at fair value, and report the changes in fair value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the collection or realization of expected cash flows, in earnings in the
period in which the change occurs. To determine the fair value of servicing assets, we use a valuation model that
calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income, which is based on the monthly fee we receive for servicing the securitized notes. We use market assumptions in the valuation model, including estimates of prepayment speeds,
default rates, and discount rates. We have inherent risk for changes in the fair value of the servicing asset but do not deem the risk significant and therefore, do not use other financial instruments to mitigate this risk. Effective December30, 2006, upon the remeasurement of our servicing assets at fair value, we recorded a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the 2007 beginning balance of retained earnings of $1 million after-tax $2 million pretax in our Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity. Accordingly, servicing assets totaled $11 million at year-end 2006 and $13 million
on the first day of fiscal year 2007. At year-end 2007, servicing assets totaled $15 million.

Principally represents changes due to collection/realization of expected cash

Contractually specified servicing fees, late fees, and ancillary fees earned for 2007, 2006, and 2005 totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $4 million, respectively, and were reflected within the changes in fair value to the servicing assets
noted above. We have included gains from the sales of timeshare notes receivable totaling $81 million in 2007 and $77
million in 2006 within the Timeshare sales and services revenue caption in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable of $69 million in 2005 are in the Gains and other income
caption in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. For additional information regarding the classification of gains from the sale of timeshare notes receivable, see the Basis of Presentation caption in Footnote No1,
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. In addition, in September 2006, we repurchased notes receivable with a principal balance of $31 million and in November 2006, sold those notes, along with $249 million of additional notes in a
$280 million note securitization. The gain on the sale of these notes is included in the $77 million gain noted earlier in this paragraph. We had residual interests of $238 million and $221 million, respectively, at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006, which are recorded in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as other long-term receivables of $157
million and $137 million, respectively, and other current assets of $81 million and $84 million, respectively. At the
dates of sale and at the end of each reporting period, we estimate the fair value of residual interests, including servicing assets, using a discounted cash flow model. These transactions may utilize interest rate swaps to protect the net interest
margin associated with the beneficial interest. We report in income, changes in the fair value of residual interests, including servicing assets, as they are considered trading securities under the provisions of FAS No115. During 2007, 2006,
and 2005, we recorded trading gains of $30 million, $19 million, and $2 million, respectively. We used the following key assumptions to measure the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, at the date of sale during 2007,
2006, and 2005: average discount rate of 902 percent, 922 percent, and 856 percent, respectively; average expected annual prepayments, including defaults, of 2502 percent, 2522 percent, and 2356 percent, respectively; expected weighted average
life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 75 months, 70 months, and 79 months, respectively; and expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 34 months, 32
months, and 38 months, respectively. Our key assumptions are based on experience. We used the following key assumptions in
measuring the fair value of the residual interests, including servicing assets, in our 11 outstanding note sales at year-end 2007: an average discount rate of 796 percent; an average expected annual prepayment rate, including defaults, of 1958
percent; an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, excluding prepayments and defaults, of 62 months; and an expected weighted average life of prepayable notes receivable, including prepayments and defaults of 35 months.
Cash flows between us and third-party purchasers during 2007, 2006, and 2005, were as follows: net proceeds to us from new
timeshare note sales of $515 million, $508 million, and $399 million, respectively; repurchases by us of defaulted loans over 150 days overdue of $30 million, $24 million, and $23 million, respectively; repurchases by us of other loans in 2006 of
$31 million; servicing fees received by us of $6 million, $5 million, and $4 million, respectively; and cash flows received from our retained interests of $100 million, $91 million, and $86 million, respectively. 
90 Table of Contents
At year-end 2007, $1,263 million of principal remained outstanding in all sales in which
we had a retained residual interest. Delinquencies of more than 90 days at year-end 2007 amounted to $10 million. Existing reserves were adequate for defaulted loans that were resolved during 2007. We have been able to resell timeshare units
underlying defaulted loans without incurring material losses. We completed a stress test on the fair value of the residual
interests as of year-end 2007 with the objective of measuring the change in value associated with independent changes in individual key variables. The methodology used applied unfavorable changes that would be considered statistically significant
for the key variables of prepayment rate, discount rate, and weighted average remaining term. The fair value of the residual interests was $238 million at year-end 2007, before we applied any stress test changes. An increase of 100 basis points in
the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $4 million, or 19 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the prepayment rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $9 million, or 37 percent. An increase of 100 basis points
in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $5 million, or 23 percent, and an increase of 200 basis points in the discount rate would decrease the year-end valuation by $11 million, or 44 percent. A decline of two months in the
weighted average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $3 million, or 11 percent, and a decline of four months in the weighted average remaining term would decrease the year-end valuation by $5 million, or 23 percent. 12.
LONG-TERM DEBT Our long-term debt
at year-end 2007 and year-end 2006 consisted of the following:  in millions

debt, is unsecured. During 2007, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement, originally entered
into in 2005, to increase the aggregate borrowings and letters of credit available under the facility from $2 billion to $25 billion and to extend the expiration of the facility from 2011 to 2012. The availability of revolving credit borrowings
supports our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a spread, based on our public debt rating. Additionally, we pay quarterly fees on the facility at a rate also based
on our public debt rating. In 2005 we began issuing short-term commercial paper in Europe in addition to our long-standing
commercial paper program in the United States. Our United States and European commercial paper issuances are subject to the availability of the commercial paper market, as we have no commitment from buyers to purchase our commercial 
91 Table of Contents
paper. We reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is
not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. We classify commercial paper as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis. During 2007, we issued $350 million of aggregate principal amount of 6375 percent Series I Senior Notes due 2017. The offering of the
Notes closed on June25, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $346 million from this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes is paid on June15 and December15 of each year, and commenced on December15, 2007. The notes will mature on June15, 2017, and
are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Also
in 2007, we issued $400 million of aggregate principal amount of 5625 percent Series J Senior Notes due 2013. The offering of the notes closed on October19, 2007. We received net proceeds before expenses of approximately $396 million from
this offering, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering. We used these proceeds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, and the
repayment of commercial paper borrowings. Interest on these notes is paid on February15 and August15 of each year, and commenced on February15, 2008. The notes will mature on February15, 2013, and are redeemable, in whole or
in part, at any time and from time to time under the terms provided in the form of note. Both the Series I Senior Notes
and the Series J Senior Notes were issued under an indenture with The Bank of New York, successor to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. formerly known as The Chase Manhattan Bank, as trustee, dated as of November16, 1998. We are in compliance with covenants in our loan agreements, which require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and minimum
shareholders equity and also include, among other things, limitations on additional indebtedness and the pledging of assets. Aggregate debt maturities are: 2008-$175 million; 2009-$118 million; 2010-$51 million; 2011-$19 million; 2012-$360 million; and $2,242 million thereafter. Cash paid for interest, net of amounts capitalized, was $115 million in 2007, $73 million in 2006, and $87 million in 2005. 
Subsequent to year-end 2007, on January15, 2008, we made a $94 million cash payment of principal and interest to retire, at
maturity, all of our outstanding Series E Senior Notes.  13.

The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses decreased by $34 million and
$20 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, as a result of changes in estimates from insured events of the prior years due to changes in underwriting experience and frequency and severity trends. The year-end 2007 self-insurance reserve of $274
million is comprised of a current portion of $92 million and long-term portion of $182 million. The year-end 2006 self-insurance reserve of $271 million is comprised of a current portion of $87 million and a long-term portion of $184 million.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY Eight
hundred million shares of our ClassA Common Stock, with a par value of $01 per share, are authorized, and 10million shares of preferred stock, without par value, are authorized. As of the 2007 fiscal year-end, there were
3571million shares of our ClassA Common Stock outstanding and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. On March27, 1998, our Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
under which one preferred stock purchase right was distributed for each share of our ClassA Common Stock. Each right entitles the holder to buy 1/1000th of a share of a newly issued series of junior participating preferred stock of the Company at an exercise price of $175. The rights may not presently be exercised, but will be exercisable 10 days after a person or group acquires beneficial
ownership of 20 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock or begins a tender or exchange for 30 percent or more of our ClassA Common Stock. Shares owned by a person or group on March27, 1998, and held continuously thereafter, are
exempt for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under the rights plan. The rights are nonvoting and will expire on March27, 2008, unless previously exercised or redeemed by us for $01 each. If we are involved in a merger or certain
other business combinations not approved by the Board of Directors prior to the expiration of the rights, each right entitles its holder, other than the acquiring person or group, to purchase common stock of either the Company or the acquirer having
a value of twice the exercise price of the right. The Company does not plan to extend the shareholder rights plan or the rights beyond their March27, 2008 expiration. Accumulated other comprehensive income of $51 million at year-end 2007 primarily consisted of gains totaling $9 million associated with
available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $46 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments, partially offset by net losses of $5 million associated with interest rate swap agreement cash flow hedges. Accumulated other
comprehensive income of $44 million at year-end 2006 primarily consisted of gains totaling $35 million associated with available-for-sale securities and gains totaling $12 million associated with foreign currency translation adjustments. 15.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We believe that the fair values of current assets and current liabilities approximate their reported carrying amounts. The fair values of non-current financial assets, liabilities, and derivatives are shown in the following table.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS During
2007, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series I and Series J Senior Notes. During 2006, we entered into an
interest rate swap agreement to manage the volatility of the U.S. Treasury component of the interest rate risk associated with the forecasted issuance of our Series H Notes. During 2005, we entered into two similar instruments in conjunction with
the forecasted issuance of our Series F Notes and the exchange of our Series C and Series E Senior Notes for new Series G Notes. All five swaps were designated as cash 
93 Table of Contents
flow hedges under FAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities FAS No133 and were
terminated upon pricing of the notes. All five swaps were highly effective in offsetting fluctuations in the U.S. Treasury component. Thus, there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings during 2007, 2006, or 2005. The net losses for these swaps
were $4 million in 2007 associated with the Series I and Series J Senior Notes, zero in 2006 associated with the Series H Senior Notes, and $2 million in 2005 associated with the Series F and Series G Senior Notes were recorded in other
comprehensive income and are being amortized to interest expense using the interest method over the life of the notes. At
year-end 2007, we had four outstanding interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk associated with the residual interests we retain in conjunction with our timeshare note sales. Historically, we were required by purchasers and/or
rating agencies to utilize interest rate swaps to protect the excess spread within our sold note pools. The aggregate notional amount of the swaps is $157 million, and they expire through 2022. These swaps are not accounted for as hedges under FAS
No133. The fair value of the swaps was a net asset of $2 million at year-end 2007 and $5 million at year-end 2006. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded a $3 million net loss during 2007, a $1 million net loss during 2006 and a
$2 million net gain during 2005. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate
risk associated with forecasted timeshare note sales. During 2007, five swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was
immaterial. In 2007, we terminated two of those five swaps and recognized no gain or loss from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. The aggregate notional amount of the remaining three swaps is $238 million at year-end 2007, and they
expire through 2012. The fair value of the remaining three swaps was a net liability of $7 million at year-end 2007. For the outstanding interest rate swaps, we recorded in 2007 a $7 million net loss in other comprehensive income. During 2006, two
swaps the 2006 swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under FAS No133 and were highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. In 2006, we terminated the 2006 swaps and recognized a net gain of $1 million in the
gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2005, one swap was designated as a cash flow hedge under FAS No133 and was highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations. The amount of the ineffectiveness was
immaterial and upon termination we recognized a net gain of $2 million in gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. The second swap entered into in 2005 did not qualify for hedge accounting. The non-qualifying swap resulted in a
loss of $3 million during 2005, which was also recognized in gains from the sales of Timeshare segment notes receivable. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign currency exposure related to certain monetary assets. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of the contracts was $133
million at year-end 2007. The forward exchange contracts do not qualify as hedges in accordance with FAS No133. The fair value of the forward contracts was an asset of $2 million at year-end 2007 and zero at year-end 2006. We recorded a $10
million loss during 2007, a $34 million loss during 2006, and a $26 million gain in 2005, relating to these forward foreign exchange contracts. The net gains and losses for all years were recorded as general, administrative, and other expense and
were offset by income and losses recorded from translating the related monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the potential volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with variations in foreign exchange rates. The aggregate dollar
equivalent of the notional amounts of the contracts was $86 million at year-end 2007. These contracts have terms of less than one year and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair values are recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income. The fair value of the option contracts was approximately $1 million at year-end 2007 and zero at year-end 2006. We recorded an immaterial amount in general, administrative, and other expense due to changes in the time value of
these contracts, which is excluded from the assessment of our hedge effectiveness. The hedges were highly effective and there was no net gain or loss reported in earnings for 2007, 2006, and 2005. As of year-end 2007, the deferred gains or losses on
existing contracts accumulated in other comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next year were zero. During 2007, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions for contracts denominated in foreign currencies. The aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amounts of the
contracts was $58 million at year-end 2007. These contracts have terms of less than three years and are classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in their fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of the
forward contracts was zero at year-end 2007. We recorded an immaterial amount in general, administrative, and other expense due to changes in the time value of these contracts, which is excluded from the assessment of our hedge effectiveness. The
hedges were highly effective and there was no gain or loss reported in 2007. As of year-end 2007, the deferred gains or losses on existing contracts accumulated in other comprehensive income that we expect to reclassify into earnings over the next
three years were $1 million. 
94 Table of Contents
During 2007, 2006, and 2005, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage
currency exchange rate volatility associated with certain investments in foreign operations. The contracts offset the gains and losses associated with translation adjustments for various investments in foreign operations. One contract was designated
as a hedge in the net investment of a foreign operation under FAS No133 at year-end 2006. The hedge was highly effective and resulted in a $1 million net loss for 2007, no net gain or loss for 2006, and a $1 million net loss for 2005 in the
foreign currency translation adjustment section of other comprehensive income. Certain contracts did not qualify as hedges under FAS No133 and resulted in no gain or loss for 2007, a loss of $17 million for 2006, and a gain of $3 million for
2005, impacting our general, administrative, and other expenses. No contracts remained at year-end 2007. One contract remained at year-end 2006, which had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $43 million and a fair value of zero.
Contracts remaining at year-end 2005 had an aggregate dollar equivalent of the notional amount of $229 million and a fair value of approximately zero. During 2007 and 2006, in response to high oil prices and uncertainty surrounding the potential phase out of tax credits, we entered into oil price hedges in conjunction with our synthetic fuel operation. These hedges
do not qualify as cash flow hedges under FAS No133. Therefore, changes in the fair values of these instruments are marked-to-market through interest income at each reporting period. Correspondingly, we recorded a net loss of $8 million during
2007 and a net loss of $2 million during 2006. At year-end 2007, hedges with a total fair value of $4 million remained outstanding. At year-end 2006, hedges with a total fair value of $5 million remained outstanding. During 2003, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement under which we receive a floating rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of
interest. The swap modifies our interest rate exposure by effectively converting a note receivable with a fixed rate to a floating rate. The aggregate notional amount of the swap is $92 million and it matures in 2010. The swap is classified as a
fair value hedge under FAS No133 and the change in the fair value of the swap, as well as the change in the fair value of the underlying note receivable, is recognized in interest income. The fair value of the swap was a $2 million liability
at year-end 2007, and a $1 million asset at year-end 2006 and 2005. The hedge is highly effective and, therefore, no net gain or loss was reported during 2007, 2006, and 2005.  17.
CONTINGENCIES Guarantees We issue guarantees to certain lenders and hotel owners primarily to obtain long-term management contracts. The guarantees generally have
a stated maximum amount of funding and a term of three to 10 years. The terms of guarantees to lenders generally require us to fund if cash flows from hotel operations are inadequate to cover annual debt service or to repay the loan at the end of
the term. The terms of the guarantees to hotel owners generally require us to fund if the hotels do not attain specified levels of operating profit. Guarantee fundings to lenders and hotel owners are generally recoverable as loans repayable to us
out of future hotel cash flows and/or proceeds from the sale of hotels. We also enter into project completion guarantees with certain lenders in conjunction with hotels and Timeshare segment properties that we or our joint venture partners are
building. The maximum potential amount of future fundings for guarantees where we are the primary obligor and the carrying
amount of the liability for expected future fundings at year-end 2007 are as follows:   $ in millions Guarantee Type

The guarantees of $315 million in the preceding table do not include $245 million of guarantees that expire in the years 2011 through 2013, related to Senior Living Services lease obligations and lifecare bonds for
which we are secondarily liable. Sunrise Senior Living, Inc. Sunrise is the primary obligor of the leases and a portion of the lifecare bonds, and CNL Retirement Properties, Inc. CNL, which subsequently merged with Health
Care Property Investors, Inc., is the primary obligor of the remainder of the lifecare bonds. Prior to our sale of the Senior Living Services business in 2003, these preexisting guarantees were guarantees by us of obligations of consolidated Senior
Living Services subsidiaries. Sunrise and CNL have indemnified us for any guarantee fundings we may be called on to make in connection with these lease obligations and lifecare bonds. We do not expect to fund under the guarantees.

The table also does not include lease obligations for which we became secondarily liable
when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997, consisting of annual rent payments of approximately $7 million and total remaining rent payments through the initial term of approximately $77 million. Most of these obligations expire at
the end of the 2023 calendar year. CTF had originally made available 35million in cash collateral in the event that we are required to fund under such guarantees approximately 7million [$11 million] remained at year-end
2007. As CTF obtains releases from the landlords and these hotels exit the system, our contingent liability exposure of approximately $77 million will decline. Since the time we assumed these guarantees, we have not funded any amounts and we do not
expect to fund any amounts under these guarantees in the future. Furthermore, in addition to the guarantees noted in the
preceding table , we have provided a project completion guarantee to a lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $586 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions
from the partners, and we are liable on a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 34 percent. We do not expect to fund under the guarantee. We have also provided a project
completion guarantee to another lender for a project with an estimated aggregate total cost of $80 million. Payments for cost overruns for this project will be satisfied by the joint venture via contributions from the partners, and we are liable on
a several basis with our partners in an amount equal to our pro rata ownership in the joint venture, which is 25 percent. We do not expect to fund under this guarantee. The carrying value of the liabilities associated with these two project
completion guarantees is $7 million. In addition to the guarantees described in the preceding paragraphs, in conjunction
with financing obtained for specific projects or properties owned by joint ventures in which we are a party, we may provide industry standard indemnifications to the lender for loss, liability, or damage occurring as a result of the actions of the
other joint venture owner or our own actions. Commitments and Letters of Credit In addition to the guarantees noted previously, as of year-end 2007, we had extended approximately $4 million of loan commitments to
owners of lodging properties, under which we expect to fund approximately $2 million within one year. We do not expect to fund the remaining $2 million of commitments, which expire after five years. At year-end 2007, we also have commitments to invest up to $44 million of equity for minority interests in partnerships that plan to
purchase North American full-service and limited-service properties or purchase or develop hotel anchored mixed-use real estate projects, which expire as follows: $14 million in one to two years; and $30 million in three to five years. As of
year-end 2007, we also have a commitment to invest up to $25 million in a joint venture of which we have funded $12 million and have $13 million remaining that we expect to fund within one year. As of year-end 2007, we also had a commitment to
invest up to $29 million 20 million in a joint venture in which we are an investor. We currently do not expect to fund under this commitment. At year-end 2007, we had $96 million of letters of credit outstanding on our behalf, the majority of which related to our self-insurance programs. Surety bonds issued on our behalf at year-end 2007, totaled $468
million, the majority of which were requested by federal, state or local governments related to our lodging operations, including our Timeshare segment and self-insurance programs. Synthetic Fuel The
tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for the production and sale of synthetic fuels were established by Congress to encourage the development of alternative domestic energy sources. Congress deemed that the incentives provided by
the tax credits would not be necessary if the price of oil increased beyond certain thresholds as prices would then provide a more natural market for these alternative fuels. As a result, the tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code for
the production and sale of synthetic fuel in any given calendar year are phased out if the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for that year falls within a specified range. The Reference Price of a barrel of oil is an estimate of the annual average
wellhead price per barrel of domestic crude oil and is determined for each calendar year by the Secretary of the Treasury by April1 of the following year. In 2005 and 2006, the Reference Price was roughly equal to 89 percent and 90 percent,
respectively, of the average price in those years of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract for a barrel of light, sweet crude oil. The price range within which the credit is phased out was set in 1980 and is adjusted annually for inflation. In 2006,
the Reference Price phase-out range was $5506 to $6912. Because the Reference Price of a barrel of oil for 2006 was within that range, at $5968, there was a 33 percent reduction of the tax credits available for synthetic fuel produced and sold in
2006. 
96 Table of Contents
Assuming a 25 percent inflation adjustment factor for 2007, and assuming the ratio of
the Reference Price to the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract remains the same for November and December 2007 as it has been in the five preceding months, we currently estimate that the tax credits available for production and
sale of synthetic fuel in 2007 would begin to be phased out if the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract in 2007 exceeds approximately $62 and would be fully phased out if the average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract in
2007 exceeds approximately $78. For the year ended December28, 2007, our results reflect a provision for an estimated 7071 percent tax credit phase-out as a result of high oil prices. The average price of the benchmark NYMEX futures contract
for 2007, through December31, 2007, was approximately $7241. Late in 2006 and early in 2007, we entered into hedge
agreements to minimize operating losses that could occur if more than a majority of the tax credits is phased out in 2007. See Footnote No2, Discontinued Operations, earlier in this report, for additional information related to the synthetic fuel operations, including information related to the cessation of synthetic fuel production
permanently in November 2007. Investment in Leveraged Lease Historically, we had a $23 million investment in an aircraft leveraged lease with Delta Air Lines, Inc. Delta which we
acquired in 1994. The gross investment was comprised of rentals receivable and the residual value of the aircraft offset by unearned income. On September14, 2005, Delta filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code and informed us that it wished to restructure the lease. As a result, our investment was impaired and we had recorded pretax charges of approximately $18 million through 2006. We recorded an additional $5 million loss related to this investment
in fiscal 2007. We have no remaining exposure related to this historical investment.  18.

Thereafter 1,156 Total minimum lease payments where we are the primary obligor 1,833 Most leases have initial terms of up to 20 years and contain one or more renewal
options, generally for five- or 10-year periods. These leases provide for minimum rentals and additional rentals based on our operations of the leased property. The total minimum lease payments above include $439 million, representing obligations of
consolidated subsidiaries that are non-recourse to Marriott International, Inc. As discussed in Footnote No8,
Acquisitions and Dispositions, we became secondarily liable for annual rent payments for certain hotels when we acquired the Renaissance Hotel Group N.V. in 1997. At year-end 2007, we continued to manage 14 of these hotels under
long-term management agreements; however, due to certain provisions in the management agreements, we account for these contracts as operating leases. CTF placed funds into trust accounts to cover possible shortfalls in cash flow necessary to meet
rent payments under these leases. In turn, we released CTF affiliates from their guarantees in connection with these leases. Approximately $38 million remained in these trust accounts at year-end 2007. Minimum lease payments relating to these
leases, which are not reflected in the $1,833 million in the preceding table are as follows: $30 million in each of 2008, 2009, and 2010; $26 million in 2011; $17 million in 2012; and $33 million thereafter, for a total of $166 million.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS We are a
diversified hospitality company with operations in five business segments:  North American Full-Service Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels Resorts, Marriott Conference Centers, JW Marriott Hotels Resorts,
Marriott Conference Centers, Renaissance Hotels Resorts, and Renaissance ClubSport properties located in the continental United States and Canada;  North American Limited-Service Lodging, which includes Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, SpringHill Suites, Residence Inn, TownePlace Suites, and Marriott ExecuStay
properties located in the continental United States and Canada;  International Lodging, which includes Marriott Hotels Resorts, JW Marriott Hotels Resorts, Renaissance Hotels Resorts,
Courtyard, Fairfield Inn, Residence Inn, Ramada International, and Marriott Executive Apartments properties located outside the continental United States and Canada;  Luxury Lodging, which includes The Ritz-Carlton and Bulgari Hotels Resorts properties worldwide; and  Timeshare, which includes the development, marketing, operation, and sale of timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties worldwide under
Marriott Vacation Club, The Ritz-Carlton Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, and Horizons by Marriott Vacation Club. In addition to the segments above, in 2007 we exited the synthetic fuel business, which was formerly a separate segment but which we now report under discontinued operations. In addition to the brands noted above, in 2007 we announced our new brand of family-friendly resorts and spas, Nickelodeon Resorts
by Marriott and a new brand of lifestyle boutique hotels, Edition. At year-end 2007, no properties were yet open under either brand. In 2006, we analyzed our internal reporting process and implemented changes in the fourth quarter that were designed to improve efficiency and, as part of this process, we evaluated the impact on segment reporting.
Accordingly, we now report five operating segments, and no longer allocate indirect administrative expenses to our segments. We reflect this revised segment reporting throughout this report for all periods presented, and present historical figures
in a manner that is consistent with the revised segment reporting. See also the Form 8-K that we filed on March19, 2007, furnishing quarterly Revenues and Income from Continuing Operations for each of 2006 and 2005 in the new segment format.
98 Table of Contents
We evaluate the performance of our segments based primarily on the results of the segment
without allocating corporate expenses, interest expense, or indirect general, administrative, and other expenses. With the exception of the Timeshare segment, we do not allocate interest income to our segments. Because note sales are an integral
part of the Timeshare segment, we include note sale gains in our Timeshare segment results. We include interest income associated with Timeshare segment notes in our Timeshare segment results because financing sales are an integral part of that
segments business. We also allocate other gains or losses as well as equity in earnings or losses from our joint ventures and divisional general, administrative, and other expenses to each of our segments. Other unallocated
corporate represents that portion of our revenues, general, administrative, and other expenses, equity in earnings or losses, and other gains or losses that are not allocable to our segments. We aggregate the brands presented within our North American Full-Service, North American Limited-Service, International, Luxury, and
Timeshare segments considering their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, distribution channels, the regulatory business environment of the brands and operations within each segment and our organizational and management reporting
structure. Revenues  in millions

million in 2007 and $684 million in 2006. At year-end 2007, fixed assets totaling $257 million located outside the United States are included within the Property and equipment caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At year-end 2006,
fixed assets totaling $684 million located outside the United States include fixed assets of $336 million which are included within the Property and equipment caption and $348 million of fixed assets which are included within the
Assets held for sale caption in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. No individual country, other than the United States, constitutes a material portion of our revenues, financial results or fixed assets.  20.
VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES We
currently consolidate a holding company that holds 100 percent interest in four entities that are variable interest entities under FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities-revised FIN 46R. At year-end 2007, the
combined capital in the four variable interest entities is less than $1 million, which is used primarily to fund hotel working capital. Our equity at risk was $3 million and we held 55 percent of the common equity shares of the holding company. The
creditors of the holding company do not have general recourse to our credit. We are party to a venture that develops and
markets fractional ownership and residential interests. During the 2007 second quarter, we issued a guarantee to the senior lender of the venture in support of the senior loan facility and reevaluated our variable interests in the venture under FIN
46R. At that time, we determined that we were the primary beneficiary and as such, we also consolidated this venture. During the 2007 third quarter, the guarantee was replaced with the issuance of a loan facility for $40 million, of which $36
million is receivable and outstanding at year-end 2007. Our issuance of the loan facility was a reconsideration event under FIN 46R; we again determined we were the primary beneficiary and continue to consolidate the joint venture. At year-end
2007, the carrying amount of consolidated assets that are collateral for the variable interest entitys obligations totaled $141 million and comprised $24 million of accounts receivable, $106 million of real estate held for development,
property, equipment, and other long-term assets, and $11 million of cash. The creditors of the variable interest entity do not have general recourse to our credit. 
101 Table of Contents
In conjunction with the transaction with CTF described more fully in Footnote No8,
Acquisitions and Dispositions, under the caption 2005 Acquisitions we manage certain hotels on behalf of four tenant entities 100 percent owned by CTF, which lease the hotels from third-party owners. At year-end 2007, the
number of hotels totaled 14. The entities have minimal equity and minimal assets comprised of hotel working capital. CTF placed money in a trust account to cover cash flow shortfalls and to meet rent payments. The terms of the trust require that the
cash flows for the four tenant entities be pooled for purposes of making rent payments and determining cash flow shortfalls. At year-end 2007, the trust account held approximately $38 million. The entities are variable interest entities under FIN
46R. We do not consolidate the entities because we do not bear the majority of the expected losses. We are secondarily liable for rent payments for eight of the 14 hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls and there is no money left
in the trust. Future minimum lease payments through the end of the lease term for these eight hotels total approximately $122 million. In addition, we are also secondarily liable for rent payments of up to an aggregate cap of $44 million for the six
other hotels in the event that there are cash flow shortfalls.  21.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Equity Method
Investments We have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or
franchise services and receive fees. In addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity or guarantees to these entities. Our ownership interest in these equity method investments generally varies from 10 to 50 percent. The amount of our
consolidated retained earnings that represents undistributed earnings attributable to our equity investments totaled $9 million at year-end 2007. The following tables present financial data resulting from transactions with these related parties: Income Statement Data  in millions

Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this annual report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable
assurance regarding managements control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B.
