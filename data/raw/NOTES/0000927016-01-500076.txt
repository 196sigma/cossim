NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Organization--CuraGen Corporation the Company or CuraGen is a genomics based biopharmaceutical company that researches, develops and uses technologies based on the discovery of
genes and its understanding of their functions and relationships to accelerate the discovery and development of products to improve human and animal health and the vitality of agriculture, in collaboration with other companies and through its
proprietary internal programs. The Company was incorporated in November 1991 and, until March 1993, was engaged primarily in organizational activities, research and development of the Company technology, grant preparation and obtaining financing.
In June 2000, the Company formed 454 Corporation 454, a majority owned subsidiary. 
The 1998 and 1999 consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classification used in 2000. 
Effective March 2, 2000, the Company declared a two-for-one split on its Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock, each payable to stockholders in the form of a stock dividend. The stock
dividend was distributed on March 30, 2000 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2000. All share and per share data have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the split. 
Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include CuraGen and 454, its majority owned subsidiary. All material intercompany accounts, transactions, and profits
have been eliminated in consolidation. 
Revenue Recognition--The Company has entered into certain collaborative research agreements which provide for the partial or complete funding of specified projects in exchange for access
to and certain rights in the resultant data discovered under the related project. Revenue is recognized based upon work performed or upon the attainment of certain benchmarks specified in the related agreements see Note 4. Grant revenue is
recognized as related costs qualifying under the terms of the grants are incurred. Grant revenue is derived solely from federal and Connecticut agencies see Note 7. Deferred revenue arising from payments received from collaborative agreements is
recognized as income when earned. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents--The Company considers investments readily convertible into cash with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
Property and Equipment--Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment under capital leases is recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments
required over the term of the lease or the fair value of the assets at the inception of the lease. Additions, renewals and betterments that significantly extend the life of an asset are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are
charged to operations as incurred. Equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years, using the straight-line method. Equipment under capital leases is amortized over the shorter of the
estimated useful life or the terms of the lease, using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated life or the term of the lease, using the straight-line method. When assets are retired or
otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income. 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets--The Company regularly evaluates the recoverability of the net carrying value of its property, and intangible assets, when an indicator of impairment is
present by comparing the carrying values to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A deficiency in these cash flows relative to the carrying amounts is an indication of the need for a write-down due to impairment. The impairment write-down
would be the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair value of these assets as determined by using estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A loss on impairment would be recognized by a charge to earnings. 
Deferred Real Estate Costs--Deferred real estate costs were paid in 1997 in connection with the signing of the operating lease in New Haven, Connecticut see Note 3. These costs, which
are included in Intangible assets, net, are amortized over the remaining life of the lease as of the date of occupancy, 69 months, using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization aggregated $20,984, $32,975 and $44,966, respectively, as of
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Related amortization expense was $11,991, $11,989 and $11,991, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
28
Licensing Fees--Licensing fees for various research and development purposes were paid during 1998, 1999 and 2000. These costs, which are included in Intangible assets, net, are
amortized over the various lives of the licenses. Certain fully-amortized licensing fees were written-off during 2000. Accumulated amortization aggregated $30,288, $127,503 and $101,465, respectively, as of December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000. Related
amortization expense was $30,288, $97,215 and $429,061, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
Financing Costs--Financing costs related to the convertible subordinated debt offering see Note 8 were paid during 2000. Accumulated amortization aggregated $655,332 as of December 31,
2000. Related amortization expense was $655,332 for the year ended December 31, 2000. 
Patent Application Costs--Costs incurred in filing for patents are charged to operations, until such time as it is determined that the filing will be successful. When it becomes evident
with reasonable certainty that an application will be successful, the costs incurred in filing for patents will begin to be capitalized. Capitalized costs related to successful patent applications will be amortized over a period not to exceed twenty
years or the remaining life of the patent, whichever is shorter, using the straight-line method. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, all patent application costs have been charged to operations. 
Research and Development Costs--Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred. Grant research expenses include all direct research and development costs incurred
related to specific grant awards and programs. All remaining research and development costs are incurred for the development and maintenance of current and future research collaboration agreements and accordingly, have been classified as
collaborative research and development expenses. 
Stock-Based Compensation--In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation SFAS 123, which was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 1996. SFAS 123 requires expanded disclosures of stock-based compensation arrangements with employees and non-employees and encourages but does not require
compensation cost to be measured based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded to employees. Companies are permitted to continue to apply Accounting Principles Board APB No. 25, which recognizes compensation cost based on the
intrinsic value of the equity instruments awarded. The Company will continue to apply APB No. 25 to its stock-based compensation awards to employees. For equity instruments awarded to non-employees, the Company records the transactions based upon
the consideration received for such awards or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The Company recorded stock-based compensation expense attributable to non-employees totaling $289,754, $103,655 and
$590,769 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. For options issued to employees, the Company records the transactions based upon the difference between the option strike price and the estimated fair market value as of
the date of issuance. Stock-based compensation associated with options granted to employees during 1997 amounted to $1,672,998 and is being expensed by the Company over the vesting period of the underlying options. During 1998, 1999 and 2000, no
stock-based compensation in connection with options granted to employees was recorded as all options granted were issued at the estimated fair market value as of the date of issuance. The Company recorded amortization, net of write-offs, of
stock-based compensation expense for options issued to employees of $444,532, $261,159 and $153,413 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. 
Income Taxes--Income taxes are provided for as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. This Statement requires the use of the
asset and liability method in determining the tax effect on future years of the temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. 
Loss Per Share--Basic earnings per share EPS is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock. Due to the loss from operations, warrants granted but not yet exercised, convertible subordinated debt, and
stock options granted under the Company stock option plans but not yet exercised are antidilutive and therefore not considered for the diluted EPS calculations. Under the assumption that warrants, convertible subordinated debt and options were not
antidilutive, the denominator for diluted loss per share would be 26,049,946, 30,789,412 and 42,638,848 at December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments--Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, Disclosures  about Fair Value of Financial Instruments SFAS 107, requires the disclosure
of fair value information for certain assets and liabilities, whether or not recorded in the balance sheets, for which it is practical to estimate that value. The Company has the following financial instruments: cash, receivables, accounts payable
and accrued 
29
expenses and certain other liabilities. The Company considers the carrying amount of these items to approximate fair value due to their short term nature. In addition, the Company also has
convertible subordinated debt see Note 8. 
Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Segments--The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosures About  Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1997. The Company had one reportable segment as of December 31, 2000. 
Recently Enacted Pronouncements--In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS
133. The new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities. It requires companies to record derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Accounting for changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting. SFAS 133, as amended by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of Effective Date of SFAS 133, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 138, Accounting for Certain  Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activitites, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Historically, the Company has not entered into derivatives contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes. Accordingly,
the Company does not expect adoption of the new standard to affect its consolidated financial statements. 
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission published Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 101 summarizes certain of
the staff views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides interpretations regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition where
there is an absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. SAB 101 became effective for the Company in 2000. The Company adoption of SAB 101 did not have any effect on its consolidated financial
statements.

Genentech, Inc. 
In June 1996, the Company entered into a pilot research services and evaluation agreement with Genentech, Inc. Genentech pursuant to which the Company performed certain research services
for a $200,000 fee. The pilot collaboration was superseded by the Evaluation Agreement, signed and effective December 27, 1996. In connection with the execution of the Evaluation Agreement, Genentech made an equity investment of $1,800,000 in the
form of 614,334 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In March 1998, upon the closing of the initial public offering of its Common Stock, the Company automatically converted the Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock on a 1
for 1 basis. 
In November 1997, CuraGen and Genentech entered into a research collaboration and database subscription arrangement to discover novel genes and therapeutics. Pursuant to the agreement,
Genentech purchased $5,000,000 of Common Stock in a private placement concurrent with the Company initial public offering at the initial public offering price of $575 per share. Genentech also agreed to provide CuraGen with an interest-bearing
loan facility which based on the March 2000 amended agreement could reach $21,000,000. The loan facility contains annual borrowing limits and the outstanding principal and interest under the loan facility are payable five years from the date of the
agreement. Subject to certain limitations, during the term of the agreement, and after the end of the first year, the drawn-down portion of the loan is convertible at CuraGen option into CuraGen Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $01 per share
the Non-Voting Common Stock based upon a formula that approximates the prevailing market price of the Company Common Stock. On October 15, 1999, the Company made a drawdown of $16,000,000 under this facility and simultaneously converted the
loan into 1,955,272 shares of its Non-Voting Common Stock, par value $01 per share. The Non-Voting Common Stock is convertible into Common Stock a at any time, at Genentech option or b automatically upon the sale or transfer of the Non-Voting
Common Stock to a non-affiliated party. Genentech currently holds 2,410,272 shares of the Company Common Stock, including 1,270,272 shares of Non-Voting Common Stock. The current ownership information for Genentech is based solely on a Schedule
13G filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 14, 2001. 
In March 2000, Genentech extended its collaboration with the Company for a minimum of an additional two and one-half years. Under the terms of this extension, Genentech will pay research
funding payments for collaborative discovery of genes and for access to CuraGen functional genomic technologies and databases. In return, Genentech will retain the rights to license, develop, and market therapeutics derived from these research
efforts. The Company will also receive milestone and royalty payments based upon the development and sales of products that result from this collaboration. Genentech has the right to terminate the research collaboration, upon a breach by the Company
of any material obligation under the agreement on or after April 2000, on 60 days prior notice. 
For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded revenue of $2,731,794 related to this agreement, which represented 13% of total revenue. In addition, $768,206 has been received from
Genentech for which the related services have not been performed and, therefore, such amount is recorded as deferred revenue at December 31, 2000. 
DuPont/Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. 
Effective June 1, 1997, the Company entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with DuPont/Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. DuPont/Pioneer Hi-Bred whereby the Company

$124 The assumptions utilized by the Company in deriving the pro forma amounts for the year ended December 31, 1998 are as follows: 1 0% dividend yield, 2 50% expected volatility, 3 risk-free
interest rate of approximately 525%, and 4 expected life of the options of 10 years. The assumptions utilized by the Company in deriving the pro forma amounts for the year ended December 31, 1999 are as follows: 1 0% dividend yield, 2 102%
expected volatility, 3 risk-free interest rate of approximately 525%, and 4 expected lives of the options between 52 and 87 years. The assumptions utilized by the Company in deriving the pro forma amounts for the year ended December 31, 2000
are as follows: 1 0% dividend yield, 2 60% expected volatility, 3 risk-free interest rate of approximately 600%, and 4 expected lives of the options between 41 and 87 years. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during
the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999, and 2000 was approximately $295 per share, $323 per share and $3517 per share, respectively. 
Preferred Stock 
The Company received aggregate consideration of $1,750,000 from five investors as subscriptions for the purchase of 350,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. In September 1996, October 1996
and January 1997, the Company received proceeds of $1,600,000, $50,000 and $100,000, respectively. The Series B Preferred Stock was non-convertible and accrued dividends at the prime rate. Dividends were payable when declared by the Board of
Directors. Dividends in arrears at December 31, 1997 were $181,563. Upon completing a qualified equity financing, as defined in the Series B Preferred Stock Agreement, the Company was entitled to redeem all of the shares of the Series B Preferred
Stock. The completion of the Company initial public offering satisfied such requirement, and accordingly, in March 1998, the Company redeemed all of such Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate redemption price of $1,750,000, plus accrued
dividends and dividends in arrears. 
In addition, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock received five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 716,722 shares of Common Stock at $293 per share, which warrants expire on March
27, 2002. Such warrants were valued at $376,334. All of these warrants were exercised in 2000. The value of such warrants was accreted over the warrant period and such accretion was classified as preferred dividends. For the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1998, such accretion amounted to $68,424 and $17,106, respectively. 
6. Income Taxes 
The net deferred income tax assets consisted of the following:  December 31   1999 
2000  
Total deferred income tax assets
$30,200,000 
$66,150,000 Valuation allowance
30,200,000 
66,150,000  
Total
$0 
$0  
The deferred income tax assets are primarily a result of the federal and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards, research and development credit carryforwards, expenses related to option
exercises and timing differences relating to depreciation and amortization. As the Company has no prior earnings history, a valuation allowance has been established due to the Company uncertainty in its ability to benefit from the federal and
Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards. The change in the valuation allowance was $9,470,000, $14,800,000 and $35,950,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively. 
39 
At December 31, 2000, CuraGen and 454 had federal and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $139,000,000 and $131,000,000, and $840,000 and
$840,000, respectively. Federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in 2008, and Connecticut net operating loss carryforwards began expiring in 1998. The Company and 454 also had federal and Connecticut research and development tax
credit carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately $4,600,000 and $3,400,000, and $35,000 and $0, respectively at December 31, 2000. For income tax purposes, the Company and 454 will not file consolidated income tax returns. 
At December 31, 2000, an income tax benefit of $1,400,000 has been recorded as a result of recent Connecticut legislation, which allows companies to obtain cash refunds from the State of
Connecticut at a rate of 65% of their annual incremental research and development expense credit, in exchange for foregoing carryforward of the research and development credit. 
7. Grants 
The Company received federal grants during 1999 and earlier years, for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Such audits could lead to requests for
reimbursement by the grantor agency for any expenditures disallowed under the terms of the grant. Additionally, any noncompliance with the terms of the grant could lead to loss of current or future awards. 
During 1995, the Company received two grants from Connecticut Innovations, Inc. CII in the amounts of $450,000 and $237,500. The term of the $450,000 grant is January 4, 1995 to December
31, 2004, and the term of the $237,500 grant is February 1, 1995 to January 31, 2005. The Company could be required to repay 100% of these amounts if during the terms of the respective grants i the Company breaches and fails to cure a material
covenant, ii a material representation or warranty of the Company becomes untrue and is not cured, iii the Company becomes bankrupt or insolvent or liquidates its assets, or iv the Company is required to repay the federal grants to which the
CII grants relate. In addition, the Company could be required to repay up to 200% of the amounts of the CII grants if the Company ceases to have a Connecticut presence, during the terms of the respective grants. 
8. Convertible Subordinated Debt 
During February 2000, the Company completed an offering for $125,000,000 of 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007 and received net proceeds of approximately $121,250,000. In addition,
also in February 2000, the initial purchasers exercised their option to purchase an additional $25,000,000 of 6% convertible subordinated debentures due 2007, providing the Company with additional net proceeds of approximately $24,308,000. Related
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $8,191,667. 
The debentures may be resold by the initial purchasers to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States under Regulation
S under the Securities Act. The debentures are convertible into CuraGen Common Stock at any time prior to their maturity at a conversion price of $638275 per share. In addition, prior to February 2, 2003, if the Company Common Stock price reaches
specified levels, it has the right to redeem the debentures at a premium by converting the debentures into Common Stock. The market value of the debentures based on quoted market prices, is estimated to be $97,500,000 at December 31, 2000. 
9. Minority Interest in Subsidiary 
In June 2000, the Company launched 454, a 60% owned subsidiary established to develop novel technologies for use in drug discovery, preclinical development, and pharmacogenetics. The Company
agreed to sell to Soros Fund Management, L.L.C., and Cooper Hill Partners, L.L.C. five year warrants to purchase 937,500 shares of its Common Stock at $32375 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $12,500,000. Simultaneously, 454 sold
4,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Soros Fund Management and Cooper Hill Partners and members of the Company senior management team and related parties for an aggregate purchase price of $20,000,000. 
In order to complete the funding of 454 and in exchange for 6,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the Company contributed $20,000,000 in cash and certain technologies for conducting
genomic analyses. As a result of this contribution of technology to 454, the Company recognized a gain of $3,928,869 recorded in additional paid-in capital.

10. Subsequent Event 
In January 2001, the Company entered into collaboration agreements with Bayer Corporation and Bayer AG Bayer involving the metabolic disorders field and the pharmacogenomics and
toxicogenomics fields, respectively. 
Under the metabolic disorder agreement, the Company and Bayer have agreed to collaborate on the discovery and development of small molecule drugs to treat metabolic diseases based on certain
qualified drug targets identified by the Company. The Company will bear the costs of the collaboration related to its identification of potential targets and Bayer will bear the costs of the collaboration related to the screening of such targets.
All costs of the collaboration related to the development of any compound identified in the collaboration will be borne equally by Bayer and the Company. Operating income derived from any compound developed under the collaboration will be divided
56% to Bayer and 44% to the Company. Ultimately, the Company will jointly commercialize drugs resulting from this alliance with Bayer, and then share profits according to respective contributions.
Under the pharmacogenomics agreement, Bayer and the Company have agreed to collaborate to develop toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomic services for use in the identification of gene-based
markers, assays and databases useful in predicting the toxicity of drug candidates and the gene expression profiling of animal and human cells to predict the pharmacological effectiveness of drug candidates. This collaboration agreement is for a
term of five years, consisting of a set-up phase and a production phase. In the set-up phase, the Company has agreed to create a database of genes associates with toxicity and develop certain technologies to be used for high throughput toxicogenomic
testing. In the production phase, the Company will conduct certain pharmacogenomic testing and analyses of Bayer targets. Bayer has agreed to provide funding to the Company over the five year term of the agreement. Bayer has the right to terminate
the agreement if the Company fails to achieve certain performance criteria. 
As part of these collaborations, Bayer purchased 3,112,482 shares of the Company Common Stock in a private placement, at a price of approximately $2731 per share or $85,000,000 in the
aggregate.
