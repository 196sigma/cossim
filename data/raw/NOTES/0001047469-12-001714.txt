Management Report on Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control    
The
management of CovanceInc. Covance has prepared, and is responsible for, Covance consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. These consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
Covance
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for assessing the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. The purpose of this system of internal accounting controls over financial reporting is to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that transactions are executed
in accordance with management authorization and are properly recorded, and that accounting records may be relied upon for the preparation of accurate and complete consolidated financial statements.
The design, monitoring and revision
of internal accounting control systems involve, among other things, management judgment with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. Covance also maintains
an internal audit function that evaluates and reports on the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, policies and procedures. Covance
management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011 was effective and adequate to accomplish the objectives described above.
Management assessment was based upon the criteria in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Covance
consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of control over financial reporting have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst YoungLLP, as
stated in their reports which are included elsewhere herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. 
We
have audited CovanceInc. internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. CovanceInc. management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report on consolidated financial statements and internal
control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, CovanceInc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2011 and our report dated February28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
CovanceInc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries as of December31, 2011 and2010, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of CovanceInc. and subsidiaries at
December31, 2011 and2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, CovanceInc. internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and
our report dated February28, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

1.Organization  CovanceInc. and its subsidiaries Covance or the Company is a leading drug development services company providing a wide range of early-stage
and late-stage
product development services on a worldwide basis primarily to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. Covance also provides services such as laboratory testing to the
chemical, agrochemical and food industries. Covance operations constitute two segments for financial reporting purposes. The first segment, early development services, includes preclinical and
clinical pharmacology service offerings. The second segment, late-stage development services, includes central laboratory, PhaseII-IV clinical development and market
access services. Operations are principally focused in the United States and Europe. 
2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by Covance. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions are eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates in which Covance owns between 20and 50percent and does not have the
ability to exercise control. For investments in which Covance owns less than 20percent and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating or financial decisions of
the investee, the cost method of accounting is applied. Where the fair value of the shares of the cost method investee is based on quoted prices in active markets, Covance accounts for such investment
as available-for-sale securities. See Note5.  Use of Estimates  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP,
which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.  Foreign Currencies  For subsidiaries outside of the United States that operate in a local currency environment, income and expense items are translated to
United States dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates and equity accounts are
translated at historical exchange rates. Translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheets and are included in the
determination of comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income in the consolidated
statements of income.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of purchase
and consist principally of amounts invested in money market funds and bank deposits.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Financial Instruments  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying
amounts as reported at December31, 2011 and2010. 
Accounts
receivable and unbilled services represent amounts due from Covance customers who are concentrated primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Covance
endeavors to monitor the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the ordinary course of business. Although Covance customers are concentrated primarily within these two
industries, management considers the likelihood of material credit risk as remote. In addition, in some cases Covance requires advance payment for a portion of the contract price from its customers
upon the signing of a contract for services. These amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed. Historically, bad debts have been immaterial.  Inventory  Inventories, which consist principally of finished goods and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost first-in,
first-out method or market.  Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets  In connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to
investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such as travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which the Company is reimbursed at cost, without
mark-up or profit. Amounts receivable from customers in connection with billed and unbilled investigator fees, volunteer payments and other out-of-pocket
pass-through costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $613million and $491million at
December31, 2011 and2010, respectively. See Note2 Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method at
rates adequate to allocate the cost of the applicable assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range from ten to forty years for buildings and improvements, three to ten years for
equipment, furniture and fixtures and three to five years for computer hardware and software, except for certain large enterprise-wide software applications which are depreciated over
periods of up to ten years. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the associated
remaining lease term. The cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use is capitalized and amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. Costs
incurred during the development phase are capitalized, while all other costs are expensed as incurred. Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Covance reviews its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, for impairment
when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon Covance judgment of its
ability

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
to
recover the value of the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations. Actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated. During the fourth quarter
of2011, Covance determined that the carrying value of its equity method investment in a supplier of research products was no longer fully recoverable based upon changes in the research product
market. The impairment was determined to be other-than-temporary and Covance recorded a charge of $121million to reduce the carrying value of the equity investment to
its estimated fair value of approximately $104million as of December31, 2011. See Note5. During the third quarter of2010, Covance determined that
long-lived assets used in its North American toxicology operations, located in Chandler, Arizona and Manassas, Virginia with carrying values of $1827million and
$234million, respectively, were no longer fully recoverable from the cash flows expected from those assets. Accordingly, as of September30, 2010, Covance recorded an asset impairment
charge totaling $1192million $1030million of which relates to the Chandler, Arizona assets and $162million relates to the Manassas, Virginia assets, representing the
excess of the carrying value of those assets over their respective fair market values. See Note13.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and Impairment  Goodwill represents costs in excess of the fair value of net tangible and identifiable net intangible assets acquired in business
combinations. Covance performs an annual test for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter. This test is performed by comparing, at the reporting
unit level, the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value. Covance assesses fair value based upon its estimate of the present value of the future cash flows that it expects to be
generated by the reporting unit. The annual test for impairment performed for2011, 2010 and2009 indicated that no reporting units were at significant risk for impairment. 
Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range in term from one to ten years. The Company
periodically evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets. See Note4.  Revenue Recognition  Covance recognizes revenue either as services are performed or products are delivered, depending on the nature of the work contracted.
Historically, a majority of Covance net revenues have been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few months to two years, but can extend in duration up to five years or longer.
Covance also has committed minimum volume arrangements with certain clients with initial terms that generally range in duration from three to ten years. Underlying these arrangements are individual
project contracts for the specific services to be provided. These arrangements enable our clients to secure our services in exchange for which they commit to purchase an annual minimum dollar value
volume of services. Under these types of arrangements, if the annual minimum volume commitment is not reached, the client is required to pay Covance for the shortfall. Progress towards the
achievement of annual minimum volume commitments is monitored throughout the year. Annual minimum commitment shortfalls are not included in net revenues until the amount has been determined and agreed
to by the client. 
Service
contracts generally take the form of fee-for-service or fixed-price arrangements. In cases where performance spans multiple accounting periods, revenue
is recognized as services are performed, measured on a proportional-performance basis, generally using output measures that are specific to the service provided. Examples of output measures in our
early development segment include the number of slides read,

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
dosings
performed, or specimens prepared for preclinical laboratory services, or number of dosings or number of volunteers enrolled for clinical pharmacology. Examples of output measures in our
late-stage development segment PhaseII-IV clinical development service offering include among others, number of investigators enrolled, number of sites initiated,
number of patients enrolled and number of monitoring visits completed. Revenue is determined by dividing the actual units of work completed by the total units of work required under the contract and
multiplying that percentage by the total contract value. The total contract value, or total contractual payments, represents the aggregate contracted price for each of the agreed upon services to be
provided. Covance does not have any contractual arrangements spanning multiple accounting periods where revenue is recognized on a proportional-performance basis under which the Company has earned
more than an immaterial amount of performance-based revenue i.e.,potential additional revenue tied to specific deliverables or performance. Changes in the scope of work are common,
especially under long-term contracts, and generally result in a change in contract value. Once the client has agreed to the changes in scope and renegotiated pricing terms, the contract
value is amended and revenue is recognized, as described above. Estimates of costs to complete are made to provide, where appropriate, for losses expected on contracts. Costs are not deferred in
anticipation of contracts being awarded, but instead are expensed as incurred. 
Billing
schedules and payment terms are generally negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. In some cases, Covance bills the client for the total contract
value in progress-based installments as certain non-contingent billing milestones are reached over the contract duration, such as, but not limited to, contract signing, initial dosing,
investigator site initiation, patient enrollment or database lock. The term billing milestone relates only to a billing trigger in a contract whereby amounts become billable and payable in
accordance with a negotiated predetermined billing schedule throughout the term of a project. These billing milestones are not performance-based i.e.,potential additional arrangement
consideration tied to specific deliverables or performance. In other cases, billing and payment terms are tied to the passage of time e.g.,monthly billings. In either case, the total
contract value and aggregate amounts billed to the client would be the same at the end of the project. While Covance attempts to negotiate terms that provide for billing and payment of services prior
or within close proximity to the provision of services, this is not always the case, as evidenced by fluctuations in the levels of unbilled receivables and unearned revenue from period to period.
While a project is ongoing, cash payments are not necessarily representative of aggregate revenue earned at any particular point in time, as revenues are recognized when services are provided, while
amounts billed and paid are in accordance with the negotiated billing and payment terms. 
In
some cases, payments received are in excess of revenue recognized. For example, a contract invoicing schedule may provide for an upfront payment of 10% of the full contract value
upon contract signing, but at the time of signing, performance of services has not yet begun, and therefore, no revenue has yet been recognized. Payments received in advance of services being
provided, such as in this example, are deferred as unearned revenue on the balance sheet. As the contracted services are subsequently performed and the associated revenue is recognized, the unearned
revenue balance is reduced by the amount of revenue recognized during the period. 
In
other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed, and the difference,
representing an unbilled receivable, is recorded for this amount which is currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual
terms. Once the client is invoiced, the unbilled receivable is reduced for the amount billed, and a corresponding account receivable is recorded. All unbilled receivables are billable to customers
within one year from the respective balance sheet date.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Most
contracts are terminable by the client, either immediately or upon notice. These contracts often require payment to Covance of expenses to wind down the study or project, fees
earned to date and, in some cases, a termination fee or a payment to Covance of some portion of the fees or profits that could have been earned by Covance under the contract if it had not been
terminated early. Termination fees are included in net revenues when realization is assured. In connection with the management of multi-site clinical trials, Covance pays on behalf of its
customers fees to investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs such as for travel, printing, meetings, couriers, etc., for which it is reimbursed at cost, without
mark-up or profit. Investigator fees are not reflected in total revenues or expenses where Covance acts in the capacity of an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company sponsor, passing
through these costs without risk or reward to Covance. All other out-of-pocket costs are included in total revenues and expenses.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of revenue includes direct labor and related benefit charges, other direct costs, shipping and handling fees, and an allocation
of facility charges and information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related
benefit charges, advertising and promotional expenses, administrative travel and an allocation of facility charges and information technology costs and excludes depreciation and amortization. Cost of
advertising is expensed as incurred.  Taxes  Covance uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates in effect for the year
in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in enacted tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is effective. See
Note7. 
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Company believes it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is
more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as either a current or long-term liability in the consolidated
balance sheet based on when the Company expects each of the items to be settled. Covance accrues interest and penalties in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The
Company also maintains a tax reserve related to exposures for non-income tax matters, including value-added tax, state sales and use and other taxes. The balance of this
reserve was $10million at both December31, 2011 and2010 and is recorded as a current liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance
sheet. 
While
Covance believes it has identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and the reserve it has established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances, it
is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved. It is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause
Covance to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
Covance
historical policy has been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted
foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. As a result, taxes have not been provided on any of the remaining accumulated foreign unremitted earnings as of December31,
2011. See Note7.  Comprehensive Income  Covance total comprehensive income for the periods presented is comprised of net income plus the change in the cumulative
translation adjustment equity account, the adjustments, net of tax, for the current year actuarial gains losses and prior service costs in connection with its defined benefit pension and other
post-retirement plans and the change in the unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities of $03million, $03million and $08million,
net of tax, for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and2009, respectively.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company sponsors several stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which non-qualified stock options and restricted
stock awards are granted to eligible employees. These plans are described more fully in Note10. The grant-date fair value of awards expected to vest is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related awards.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Covance sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans which are more fully described in Note9.
The measurement of the related benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs recorded each year are based upon actuarial computations, which require management judgment as to certain
assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rates to use in computing the present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs, the expected future rate of salary
increases for pay-related plans and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for funded plans. The discount rates are derived based on a hypothetical yield
curve represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the target asset allocation and the average expected
rate of growth for the asset classes invested. The average expected rate of growth is derived from a combination of historic returns, current market indicators, the expected risk premium for each
asset class and the opinion of professional advisors. Liabilities related to all of Covance pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are measured as of December31.  Earnings Per Share EPS  Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have
been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued; computed under the treasury stock method. In
computing diluted EPS for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and2009, the denominator was increased by 1,461,566 shares, 1,428,765 shares and 522,367 shares,
respectively, representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding at December31, 2011, 2010 and2009, with exercise prices less than the

average
market price of Covance common stock during each respective period. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2011 were options to purchase
2,335,194 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $5415 to $9434 per share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock
during2011. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the year ended December31, 2010 were options to purchase 1,639,806 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $5193 to
$9434 per share because the exercise prices of such options were greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during2010. Excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for
the year ended December31, 2009 were options to purchase 825,401 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $4727 to $9434 per share because the exercise prices of such options were
greater than the average market price of Covance common stock during2009.  Reimbursable Out-of-Pocket Expenses  As discussed in Note2 Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets, Covance pays on behalf of its customers fees to
investigators, volunteers and other out-of-pocket costs for which the Company is reimbursed at cost, without mark-up or profit. Amounts paid to volunteers and other
out-of-pocket costs are reflected in operating expenses, while the reimbursements received are reflected in revenues in the consolidated statements of income. Covance excludes
from revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of income fees paid to investigators and the associated reimbursement since Covance acts as an agent on behalf of the pharmaceutical company
sponsors with regard to investigator payments.  Supplemental Cash Flow Information  Cash paid for interest for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $38million, $06million
and $12million, respectively. Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 totaled $582million, $336million and
$268million, respectively. The change in income taxes payable in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 includes as an operating
cash outflow the excess tax benefit received from the exercise of non-qualified stock options of $09million, $16million and $08million, respectively a
corresponding cash inflow of $09million, $16million and $08million, respectively, has been included in financing cash flows.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2011-04, Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S.GAAP and IFRSs ASU 2011-04. ASU
2011-04 amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ASC 820 to converge the fair value measurement guidance in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs. Some of the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements, while
other amendments change particular principles in ASC 820. In addition, ASU 2011-04 requires additional fair value disclosures. ASU 2011-04 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December15, 2011 and should be applied prospectively. Covance does not expect ASU 2011-04 to have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operations or
financial position.

2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-05, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Presentation of Comprehensive
Income
ASU 2011-05. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity and
requires an entity to present items of net income, other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but
consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Comprehensive Income Topic 220: Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the
Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No2011-05 ASU
2011-12. ASU 2011-12 defers the effective date of the changes in 2011-05 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments for each component of
other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income. The amendments in the ASU do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of
other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 are both effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years,
beginning after December15, 2011 and must be applied retrospectively. Covance will be required to adopt ASU 2011-05 and ASU 2011-12 no later than the quarter beginning
January1, 2012. As the ASU require additional presentation only, there will be no impact to Covance consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
In
September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Topic 350: Testing Goodwill for
Impairment ASU 2011-08. ASU 2011-08 gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in
Topic 350. Previous guidance required an entity to test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is effective for
annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2011. Covance will be required to adopt ASU 2011-08 as of January1, 2012
and does not expect ASU 2011-08 to have an impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial position.  Subsequent Events  Subsequent events are defined as those events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date, but before the financial
statements are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See Note15.

and 2009, respectively. 
In
the fourth quarter of 2011, Covance completed the wind-down and transition of services at its toxicology facility in Vienna, Virginia and initiated actions to sell that
property. As a result, the related land and buildings, with carrying values of $210million and $60million, respectively, were reclassified from property and equipment to other
current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2011.

5.Equity Investments  Covance has a minority equity position less than 20% in Caprion Proteomics Caprion, a privately held company headquartered in Montreal, Canada,
which was acquired in December 2008
for a total cost of
$31million. Caprion is a leading provider of proteomics-based services to the pharmaceutical industry. As Covance owns less than a 20% interest in Caprion and does not exercise significant
influence over the operating or financial decisions of Caprion, the investment is accounted for under the cost method. This investment is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Covance
has a 47% minority equity position in Noveprim Limited Noveprim, a supplier of research products, which was acquired in March 2004 at a total cost of $207million.
The excess of the purchase price over the underlying equity in Noveprim net assets at the date of acquisition of $138million represents goodwill and is included in the carrying value of
Covance investment. This investment is reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. During the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, Covance recognized income of
$05million, $08million and $09million, respectively, representing its share of Noveprim earnings, net of the elimination of profit on inventory purchased from Noveprim and
still on hand at Covance at December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the investment was determined to have an other-than-temporary loss in
value due to a decline in demand for the research products supplied by Noveprim. As a result, Covance recorded a $121million impairment charge, against the goodwill recognized upon the
initial investment in Noveprim, to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. The fair value was measured with an income approach using internally developed estimates of
future cash flows, which are Level3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of Covance investment in Noveprim as of December31, 2011 and 2010 was
$104million and $220million, respectively. 
Covance
has a minority equity position less than 20% in Bio-Clinica,Inc. BIOC Nasdaq GM:BIOC. BIOC uses proprietary medical imaging technologies to process
and analyze medical images, and also provides other services, including the data-basing and regulatory submission of medical images, quantitative data and text. As Covance owns less than a
20% interest in BIOC and does not exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of BIOC, the investment is accounted for as an available-for-sale
security. The cost basis of Covance investment in BIOC is $14million. The carrying value of Covance investment in BIOC as of December31, 2011 and 2010 was $100million and
$105million, respectively, as determined based on quoted prices in an active market. This investment is reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The $05million
decrease in the carrying value of the investment results in a $03million decrease in the unrealized gain on investment, net of tax, which is included within accumulated other comprehensive
income on the consolidated balance sheet. Accordingly, the balance in the unrealized gain on investment at December31, 2011 and 2010 was $52million and $55million, net of
tax, respectively. 
6.Acquisitions and Divestitures  In October 2010, Covance acquired research and development facilities located in Porcheville, France and Alnwick, UK from Sanofi for a cash payment of
$279million
$210million net of cash acquired. Transaction related costs of approximately $26million were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the period incurred.
Pursuant to the asset purchase agreement, Covance will provide services to Sanofi at these facilities over a period of 5years for $350million. The tangible and intangible assets
acquired are included in Covance consolidated financial statements as of October 2010 based on their estimated fair values of $261million and $18million, respectively, partially
offset by certain employee related liabilities of $69million assumed in the transaction. Intangible assets are being amortized over a six-year life. Results of operations for the
sites acquired from Sanofi are reported in Covance early development segment beginning

6.Acquisitions and Divestitures Continued 
in
November 2010. In addition to the acquisition and provision of services at these facilities, Covance and Sanofi also entered into a ten-year strategic alliance, pursuant to which
Covance has become Sanofi RD partner providing drug development services to Sanofi in amounts ranging from $09billion to $19billion over the term of the agreement. In
August 2009, Covance acquired certain assets and capabilities of MerckCo.,Inc. Merck Gene Expression Laboratory GEL located in
Seattle, Washington for $975million in cash. Transaction related costs of $07million were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the period incurred. The tangible
assets acquired consisted of property and equipment and were included in Covance consolidated financial statements beginning in August 2009 based on their estimated fair value of
$55million. The remaining purchase price of $42million represents the fair value of the acquired assembled workforce, which is a component of goodwill. Results of operations for GEL
are reported in Covance early development segment beginning in August 2009. Covance and Merck also entered into an agreement pursuant to which Merck committed to purchase at least
$1450million of services from Covance over a five year period. 
In
August 2009, Covance sold its interactive voice and web response IVR service offering, part of Covance late-stage development segment, to Phase Forward which was
subsequently acquired by Oracle Corporation for net cash proceeds totaling $97million and recorded a pre-tax gain of $90million $59million after tax on the
sale. 
In
March 2009, Covance acquired 100% of the stock of Swiss Pharma ContractLtd. Swiss Pharma, and its 50 bed clinical research facility based in Basel, Switzerland, for total
consideration of $228million, as to which $194million $183million net of cash acquired was paid at closing with the balance contingently payable based upon the achievement
of certain performance based milestones through 2011. Additionally, Covance repaid the entire $54million balance of mortgage debt assumed in the Swiss Pharma acquisition. Transaction related
costs of $05million were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the period incurred. Net tangible and intangible assets acquired in the acquisition were included in the
consolidated financial statements beginning in March 2009 based on their estimated fair values of $30million and $18million, respectively. Intangible assets are being amortized over
a seven-year weighted average life. Goodwill of $180million resulting from the acquisition arises largely from the synergies expected from combining the Swiss Pharma operations
with our existing European clinical pharmacology operations, as well as from the benefits derived from the assembled Swiss Pharma workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be
deductible for tax purposes. Results of operations for Swiss Pharma are reported in Covance early development segment beginning in March 2009.

As of December31, 2011, Covance has United States and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $454million. The foreign
net
operating loss carryforwards of $427million have no expiration, while the United States net operating loss carryforwards of $27million are subject to limitation under Internal
Revenue Code 382 and will expire at various dates through 2026. It is expected that all loss carryforwards will be realized, and accordingly, no valuation allowance has been provided. Covance
currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent those earnings are taxable or are expected to be remitted. Covance historical policy has
been to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the United States. Covance intends to continue to leave its unremitted foreign earnings invested indefinitely outside the
United States. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable if such accumulated earnings were remitted. Additionally, if such accumulated earnings were remitted,
certain countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are available for use as a tax credit against any Federal income tax liability arising from such remittance. As a
result, taxes have not been provided on accumulated foreign unremitted earnings totaling approximately $670million at December31, 2011.

7.Taxes on Income Continued 
The
Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if the Company believes it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical
merits of the position. The amount of the accrual for which an exposure exists is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that the Company believes is
more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the position. Components of the reserve are classified as either a current or long-term liability in the consolidated
balance sheet based on when the Company expects each of the items to be settled. Covance accrues interest and penalties in relation to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 
As
of December31, 2011, the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was $164million, including accrued interest of $16million, which is recorded
as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December31, 2010, the balance of the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was
$150million, including accrued interest of $10million, which was recorded as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. This reserve
relates to exposures for income tax matters such as transfer pricing, nexus and deemed income. During the year ended December31, 2011, the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was increased
by $14million resulting from the accrual of additional reserves of $38million, primarily relating to transfer pricing and the accrual of interest on existing reserves, partially
offset by $24million of reductions due to settlements and the expiration of the period of review of filings in certain jurisdictions. Following
is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued interest for the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010: 
dollars in millions Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2009 160 Additions related to tax positions in the prior year 38 Additions related to tax positions in the current year 19 Reductions due to settlements and payments 72 Reductions due to statute expiration 05 Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2010 140 Additions related to tax positions in the current year 30 Reductions due to settlements and payments 19 Reductions due to statute expiration 03 Unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2011 148 
Any future changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, resulting from the recognition of tax benefits, would impact the
effective tax
rate. Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the uncertainty surrounding up to $97million, including accrued interest of $14million, of the reserve for
unrecognized tax benefits related to certain income taxes, deemed income and transfer pricing will be resolved as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations or the conclusion of various
federal, state and foreign tax audits.

8.Credit Facilities  On October26, 2010, Covance amended its credit facility which was due to expire in June 2012. The amended credit agreement the Credit Agreement
provides for a revolving
credit facility of up to $250million, which may be expanded to $300million at Covance election, and a term loan commitment of $100million. On August31, 2011, Covance
repaid and retired all outstanding debt on the term loan portion of the Credit Agreement. At December31, 2011, there were $300million of outstanding borrowings and $26million
of outstanding letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. At December31, 2010, there were $350million of outstanding borrowings and $14million of outstanding
letters of credit under the revolving credit facility and $975million of outstanding debt under the term loan facility. Interest on all
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement is computed in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement and is presently based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 200
basis points. Interest on all outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility was also based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate plus a margin of 200 basis points. Interest on outstanding
borrowings approximated 235% per annum during 2011 and 238% per annum during 2010. Costs associated with the Credit Agreement, which expires in October 2015, consisted primarily of bank and legal
fees totaling $17million, and are being amortized over the five-year term. 
The
Company pays a commitment fee of 30 basis points on the undrawn balance of the revolving credit facility, which totaled approximately $06million and $05million
during the years ended December31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Credit Agreement contains various financial and other covenants and is collateralized by guarantees of certain of Covance
domestic subsidiaries and a pledge of 65percent of the capital stock of certain of Covance foreign subsidiaries. At December31, 2011, Covance was in compliance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement. 
9.Employee Benefit Plans  Covance sponsors various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. All plans have a measurement date of December31.  Defined Benefit Pension Plans  Covance sponsors two defined benefit pension plans for the benefit of its employees at two United Kingdom subsidiaries and one defined
benefit pension plan for the benefit of its employees at a German subsidiary, all of which are legacy plans of previously acquired companies. Benefit amounts for all three plans are based upon years
of service and compensation. The German plan is unfunded while the United Kingdom pension plans are funded. Covance funding policy has been to contribute annually a fixed percentage of the eligible
employee salary at least equal to the local statutory funding requirements.

the asset classes invested. The rate of expected growth is derived from a combination of historic returns, current market indicators, the expected risk premium for each asset class over the
risk-free rate and the opinion of professional advisors.

Investments
are made in pooled investment funds. Pooled investment fund managers are regulated by the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom and operate under terms which
contain restrictions on the way in which the portfolios are managed and require the managers to ensure that suitable internal operating procedures are in place. The trustees have set performance
objectives for each fund manager and routinely monitor and assess the managers' performance against such objectives.

aMutual funds represent pooled investment vehicles offered by investment managers, which are generally comprised of
investments in equities, bonds, property and cash. The plans' trustees hold units in these funds, the value of which is determined by the number of units held multiplied by the unit price calculated

Series Preferred Stock. The Covance Board of Directors has the authority to issue such shares from time to time, without stockholder approval, and to determine the designations, preferences, rights,
including voting rights, and restrictions of such shares, subject to the Delaware General Corporate Laws. Pursuant to this authority, the Covance Board of Directors has designated 10million
shares of the Covance Series Preferred Stock as Covance SeriesA Preferred Stock. No other class of Covance Series Preferred Stock has been designated by the Board. As of December31,
2011, no Covance Series Preferred Stock has been issued or is outstanding.  DividendsCommon Stock  Covance Board of Directors may declare dividends on the shares of Covance common stock out of legally available funds subject to
any preferential rights of any outstanding Covance Series Preferred Stock. However, Covance has no present intention to declare dividends, but instead intends to retain earnings to provide funds for
the operation and expansion of its business.  Treasury Stock  The Board of Directors has, from time to time, approved stock repurchase programs enabling Covance to repurchase shares of its common
stock. In September2010, the Covance Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $250million of the Company outstanding common stock the 2010 Repurchase Program. This
was in addition to a 30million share buyback authorization approved by the Covance Board of Directors in2007 the 2007 Repurchase Program. The Company repurchased
475million shares of its common stock at a cost of $250million under the 2010 Repurchase Program through an accelerated share repurchase which was initiated in November2010.
At December31, 2011, there were 08million shares remaining for purchase under the 2007 Repurchase Program. In addition to the Board approved share repurchase programs, Covance also
reacquires shares of its common stock when employees tender shares to satisfy income tax withholdings associated with the vesting of stock awards.

available for grant under the 2007EEPP are available for grant under the 2010EEPP. The 2010EEPP became effective on May6, 2010 and will expire on
May5, 2020. The 2010EEPP authorizes the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors the Compensation Committee, or such committee as is appointed by the
Covance Board of Directors, to administer the 2010EEPP and to grant awards to employees of Covance. The 2010EEPP authorizes the Compensation Committee to grant the following awards:
options to purchase common stock; stock appreciation rights; and other stock awards either singly or in combination. Shares granted, other than options or SARs, shall be counted against the shares
available for grant based upon the ratio of 174 for every 1share granted. The exercise period for stock options granted under the 2010EEPP is determined by the Compensation Committee
at the time of grant, and is generally ten years from the date of grant. The vesting period for stock options and stock awards granted under the 2010EEPP is determined by the Compensation
Committee at the time of grant. Beginning in2009, options are generally granted with a pro rata three-year vesting period for all employees. Prior to2009, options were
generally granted with a pro rata three-year vesting period for senior executives and a pro rata two-year vesting period for all other optionees. Stock awards generally vest
over a three-year period for all employees. The number of shares of Covance common stock initially available for grant under the 2010EEPP totaled approximately 43million
plus approximately 13million shares remaining available under the 2007EEPP at the time the 2010EEPP was approved. All grants and awards under the 2007EEPP remaining
outstanding are now administered in accordance with the provisions of the 2007EEPP out of shares issuable under the 2010EEPP. The Company may issue authorized but previously unissued
shares or treasury shares when options are exercised or for stock awards. There have been no grants of stock appreciation rights under the 2007EEPP or the 2010EEPP. At
December31, 2011 there were approximately 43million shares remaining available for grants under the 2010EEPP. 
The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the related awards based upon the grant-date fair
value of awards expected to vest. Results of operations for the year ended December31, 2011 include $401million $274million net of tax benefit of $127million of
total stock-based compensation expense, $200million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $201million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative
expenses. Results of operations for the year ended December31, 2010 include $323million $220million net of tax benefit of $103million of total stock-based
compensation expense, $172million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $151million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Results of
operations for the year ended December31, 2009 include $269million $183million net of tax benefit of $86million of total stock-based compensation expense 115million of which has been included in cost of revenue and $154million of which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 
OptionsThe grant-date fair value of stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model. The
Company uses the
Lattice-Binomial option pricing formula to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock option awards. In order to estimate the grant-date fair value, option pricing models
require the use of estimates and assumptions as to athe expected term of the option, bthe expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock, cthe
risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option and dpre-vesting forfeiture rates. The expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term,
taking into account expected employee exercise and expected post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock is based upon the
volatility of the Company stock computed over a period of time equal to the expected term of the option. The risk free interest rate is based upon the implied yields currently available from the
U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve for issues with a remaining duration equal to the

Other
costs include legal and professional fees, primarily associated with employee related matters and the outsourcing of certain functions, and other costs incurred in connection with
transitioning services from sites being closed, including costs of transitioning information technology as well as loss on disposal of assets. Other activity in the reserve rollforward primarily
reflects accelerated depreciation, the loss on disposal of assets and foreign exchange impacts as a result of the change in exchange rates between periods. In
addition to the above noted costs, in the fourth quarter of 2011, due to a decline in demand for one of its research products, Covance terminated a long-standing
inventory supply agreement and wrote-down inventory resulting in a charge of $103million. These costs have been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
early development segment. 
13.Asset Impairment  Covance reviews its long-lived assets, other than goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances occur that
indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based upon Covance judgment of its ability to recover the value of the asset from the
expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations. 
The
significant weakening of the market for outsourced toxicology services during the three-month period ended September30, 2010, which represented a reversal in trend from the
recovering demand for these services during the first half of 2010, caused Covance to reassess its North American toxicology services. This assessment included an evaluation of the ongoing value of
the long-lived assets associated with those services. Based on that evaluation, Covance determined that long-lived assets located in Chandler, Arizona and Manassas, Virginia
with carrying values of $1827million and
$234million, respectively, were no longer fully recoverable from the cash flows expected from those assets. Accordingly, as of September30, 2010, Covance recorded an asset impairment
charge totaling $1192million $1030million of which relates to the Chandler,

Arizona
assets and $162million relates to the Manassas, Virginia assets, representing the excess of the carrying value of those assets over their respective fair market values. 
The
fair value of these assets was determined with the assistance of an independent third party appraiser. Covance Chandler, Arizona facility, which will continue to be held and used,
was valued at $797million based upon both the future cash flows expected to be generated from the facility, discounted at the risk-free rate of interest, and an estimated market
value of the facility. These assets are included in property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2010. The property in Manassas, Virginia consists primarily of
land that was intended to be utilized for future expansion projects in the Early Development segment. Covance now intends to sell this property and its carrying value has been reduced to a fair value
of $72million, which value is based upon market rates for similar properties sold in the region, net of selling costs. As a result, the Manassas property was reclassified from property and
equipment to other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2010. The
following table presents the above non-financial assets measured at estimated fair value as of September30, 2010 and the resulting impairment losses included in
earnings for the year ended December31, 2010:

14.Segment Information  Covance has two reportable segments: early development and late-stage development. Early development services, which includes Covance preclinical and
clinical pharmacology
service capabilities, involve evaluating a new compound for safety and early effectiveness as well as evaluating the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the compound in the human
body. It is at this stage that a pharmaceutical company, based on available data, will generally decide whether to continue further development of a drug. Late-stage development services,
which includes Covance central laboratory, PhaseII-IV clinical development and market access services, are geared toward demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of a compound in
treating certain diseases or conditions, obtaining regulatory approval and
