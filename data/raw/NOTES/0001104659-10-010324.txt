of Contents Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Corn Products International,Inc. We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Corn Products International,Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and
redeemable equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2009. We also have audited the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2009, based
on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions. A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Corn Products International,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2009 42 Table

of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1- Description of the Business Corn Products International,Inc. CPI or the
Company was founded in 1906 and became an independent and public company as
of December31, 1997. The Company
operates domestically and internationally in one business segment, corn
refining, and produces a wide variety of products. NOTE 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of
presentation The
consolidated financial statements consist of the accounts of the Company,
including all significant subsidiaries.
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions about future events.
These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of
assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and
liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the value of purchase
consideration, valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill,
intangible assets and other long-lived assets, legal contingencies, guarantee
obligations, and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, and
pension and other postretirement benefits, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on
managements best estimates and judgment.
Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis
using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic
environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Management will adjust
such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstance dictate. Foreign currency devaluations, corn price
volatility, access to difficult credit markets, and declines in the global
economic environment have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such
estimates and assumptions. As future
events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results
could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in those estimates resulting from
continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the
financial statements in future periods. Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, other
than those whose functional currency is the US dollar, are translated at current
exchange rates with the related translation adjustments reported in equity as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss. Income statement accounts are translated at
the average exchange rate during the period.
Where the US dollar is considered the functional currency, monetary
assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates with the
related adjustment included in net income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities
are translated at historical exchange rates.
The Company incurs foreign currency transaction gains/losses relating to
assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the
functional currency. For 2009, 2008 and
2007, the Company incurred foreign currency transaction gains losses of $6
million, $9 million and $4 million, respectively. The Companys accumulated other comprehensive
loss included in equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes cumulative
translation loss adjustments of $228 million and $363 million at December31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash and
cash equivalents Cash
equivalents consist of all instruments purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less, and which have virtually no risk of loss in value. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Costs are determined using the
first-in, first-out FIFO method. Investments
Investments in the common stock of affiliated companies over which the
Company does not exercise significant influence are accounted for under the
cost method and are carried at cost or less.
The Companys wholly-owned Canadian subsidiary has an investment that is
accounted for under the cost method. The
carrying value of this investment was $6 million at December31, 2009 and
$5 million at December31, 2008.
Investments that enable the Company to exercise significant influence,
but do not represent a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity
method; such investments are carried at cost or less, adjusted to reflect the Companys
proportionate share of income or loss, less dividends received. The Company did not have any investments
accounted for under the equity method at December31, 2009 or 2008. The Company also has an 49 Table of Contents equity
interest in the CME Group Inc. CME, which it classifies as available for
sale securities. This investment is
carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded to other
comprehensive income. The Company would
recognize a loss on its investments when there is a loss in value of an
investment that is other than temporary. Property,
plant and equipment and depreciation Property, plant and equipment
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
is generally computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful
lives of depreciable assets, which range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and
from 3 to 25 years for all other assets.
Where permitted by law, accelerated depreciation methods are used for
tax purposes. The Company reviews the
recoverability of the net book value of property, plant and equipment for
impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the net book value
of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to
result from its use and eventual disposition.
If this review indicates that the carrying values will not be recovered,
the carrying values would be reduced to fair value and an impairment loss would
be recognized. Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill $238 million and $351 million at December31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired. The Company also has other intangible assets
$7 million at December31, 2009 and $8 million at December31, 2008,
respectively. The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets by
geographic segment as of December31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows

In the second quarter of 2009, the Company
wrote-off $119 million of goodwill pertaining to its South Korean
operations. See Note 4 for additional
information regarding this impairment charge.
The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently
if impairment indicators arise. The
Company has chosen to perform this annual impairment assessment in Decemberof
each year. The Company has completed the
required impairment assessments and determined there to be no additional
goodwill impairment other than the $119 million Korean goodwill impairment
charge discussed above. Revenue
recognition The Company recognizes operating revenues at the time
title to the goods and all risks of ownership transfer to customers. This transfer is considered complete when a
sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred, pricing is fixed or
determinable and collection is reasonably assured. In the case of consigned inventories, the
title passes and the transfer of ownership risk occurs when the goods are used
by the customer. Taxes assessed by
governmental authorities and collected from customers are accounted for on a
net basis and thereby excluded from revenues. Hedging
instruments The Company
uses derivative financial instruments principally to offset exposure to market
risks arising from changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates
and interest rates. Derivative financial
instruments used by the Company consist of commodity futures and option
contracts, forward currency contracts and options, interest rate swap
agreements and treasury lock agreements.
The Company enters into futures and option contracts, which are
designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities corn and natural gas
that will be purchased and processed in a future month. These derivative financial instruments are
recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company has also, from time to time,
entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the
interest rate on certain fixed rate debt to a variable interest rate and, on
certain variable rate debt, to a fixed interest rate. The Companys treasury lock agreements lock
the benchmark rate for an anticipated fixed rate borrowing. See also Note 5 and Note 6 of the notes to
the consolidated financial statements for additional information. On the date a derivative contract is entered
into, the Company designates the derivative as either a hedge of variable cash
flows to be paid related to interest on variable rate debt, as a hedge of
market variation in the 50 Table
of Contents benchmark rate for a future fixed rate debt
issue or as a hedge of certain forecasted purchases of corn or natural gas used
in the manufacturing process a cash-flow hedge, or as a hedge of the fair
value of certain debt obligations a fair-value hedge. This process includes linking all derivatives
that are designated as fair-value or cash-flow hedges to specific assets and
liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, or to specific firm commitments
or forecasted transactions. For all
hedging relationships, the Company formally documents the hedging relationships
and its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge
transactions, the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk
being hedged, how the hedging instruments effectiveness in offsetting the
hedged risk will be assessed, and a description of the method of measuring
ineffectiveness. The Company also formally
assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is
not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective
hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. Changes in the fair value of floating-to-fixed
interest rate swaps, treasury locks or commodity futures and option contracts
that are highly effective and that are designated and qualify as cash-flow
hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Realized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of
interest rate swaps and treasury locks are reclassified from accumulated other
comprehensive income AOCI to the Consolidated Statement of Income over the
life of the underlying debt. Gains and
losses on commodity hedging contracts are reclassified from AOCI to the
Consolidated Statement of Income when the finished goods produced using the
hedged item are sold. The maximum term
over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for
commodity price risk is 60 months.
Changes in the fair value of a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap
agreement that is highly effective and that is designated and qualifies as a
fair-value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged debt obligation,
are recorded in earnings. The
ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative instrument that
qualifies as either a cash-flow hedge or a fair-value hedge is reported in
earnings. The
Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that
the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows
or fair value of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated
or exercised, the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument because
it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur, or management
determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no
longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the Company
continues to carry the derivative on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at its fair
value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income
loss are recognized in earnings. Stock-based compensation The Company has a stock
incentive plan that provides for stock-based employee compensation, including
the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock, to certain key
employees. Compensation expense is
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of
Income for the Companys stock-based employee compensation plan. The plan is more fully described in Note 12. Earnings
per common share Basic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding including redeemable common stock, which totaled
749 million for 2009, 745 million for 2008 and 747 million for 2007. Diluted earnings per share EPS is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding,
including the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and other shares
associated with long-term incentive compensation plans. The weighted average number of shares
outstanding for diluted EPS calculations was 755 million, 759 million and
765 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, options to purchase
approximately 23 million, 13 million and 6 million shares of common stock,
respectively, were excluded from the calculation of the weighted average number
of shares outstanding for diluted EPS because their effects were anti-dilutive. Risks and uncertainties The
Company operates domestically and internationally in one business segment. In
each country, the business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk
and uncertainty. The Company insures its business and assets in each country
against insurable risks in a manner that it deems appropriate. Because of this
geographic dispersion, the Company believes that a loss from non-insurable
events in any one country would not have a material adverse effect on the
Companys operations as a whole. Additionally, the Company believes there is no
significant concentration of risk with any single customer or supplier whose
failure or non-performance would materially affect the Companys results. 51 Table of Contents Recently adopted accounting
standards  Effective July1,
2009, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ASC 105. ASC 105 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Codification as the source
of authoritative United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP
recognized by the FASB to be applied to nongovernmental entities and it is not
intended to change or alter previously existing US GAAP. Rulesand interpretive releases of the
SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of
authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants.
The Codification supersedes all previously existing non-SEC accounting
and reporting standards and the FASB will not issue new standards in the form
of Statements, FASB Staff Positions or Emerging Issues Task Force
Abstracts. Instead, the FASB will issue
Accounting Standards Updates ASUs.
The FASB will not consider ASUs as authoritative in their own
right. ASUs will serve only to update
the Codification, provide background information about the guidance and provide
the bases for conclusions with respect to the change or changes to the
Codification. The adoption of the
Codification did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In
June2006, the FASB issued guidance pertaining to the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes to reduce the diversity in practice associated with
certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income
taxes. In addition, the guidance
provides insight with respect to de-recognition, classification, interest and
penalties, and accounting in interim periods and requires expanded disclosure
with respect to uncertainty in income taxes.
The Company adopted the provisions of the guidance effective January1,
2007 by recognizing a $2 million cumulative effect reduction in the beginning
balance of retained earnings. See also
Note 8 for additional information. In
September2006, the FASB issued guidance pertaining to the accounting and
disclosure for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Among other things, the guidance requires
companies to: i recognize in the balance sheet, a net liability or
asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income,
to record the funded status of defined benefit pension and other
post-retirement benefit plans; iimeasure plan assets and obligations
that determine its funded status as of the end of the companys fiscal year;
and iiirecognize in comprehensive income the changes in the funded
status of a defined benefit pension and postretirement plan in the year in
which the changes occur. The requirement
to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure
requirements were effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after December15,
2006. The requirement to measure the
plan assets and benefit obligations as of the year-end balance sheet date is
effective for fiscal years ending after December15, 2008. Accordingly, the Company began measuring its
plan assets and benefit obligations using a December31stbalance sheet date, effective December31,
2008. Previously, the Company had used a
September30thmeasurement date. The change to using a year-end balance sheet
measurement date did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. See also Note 9 of
the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. In
February2007, the FASB issued guidance that provides entities with the
option to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at
specified election dates. Such election,
which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically
irrevocable once elected. Subsequent
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been
elected are to be reported in earnings.
This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November15,
2007. The Company elected not to measure
any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value. In
December2007, the FASB issued guidance establishing new accounting and
reporting standards for a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. Among
other things, the guidance clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a
subsidiary previously referred to as a minority interest in a subsidiary is
an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that is to be reported as
equity in the consolidated balance sheet, as opposed to being reported in the
mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and equity. Under the guidance, consolidated net income
is reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent
and the non-controlling interest. The
guidance also requires disclosure of the amounts of consolidated net income
attributable to the parent and to the non-controlling interest on the face of
the consolidated statement of income.
Additionally, it establishes a single method of accounting for changes
in a parents ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in
deconsolidation and clarifies that such transactions are equity transactions if
the parent retains its controlling financial interest in the subsidiary. The guidance also requires that a parent
recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The Company adopted the new guidance
effective January1, 2009. The
adoption did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial 52 Table of Contents statements. As required, the prior year consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current years
presentation. These reclassifications
had no effect on CPIs previously reported net income or cash flows. In December2007, the
FASB issued guidance on how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration
transferred, identifiable assets, liabilities assumed, non-controlling
interest, and goodwill acquired in a business combination. The guidance also expands required
disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business
combinations. The revised guidance is
effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December15,
2008. The adoption of the new guidance
did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements, however the guidance will impact the accounting for future business
combinations and the effect will be dependent upon the acquisitions at that
time. In February2008, the
FASB issued revised guidance related to fair value measurements, which among
other things, partially deferred the effective date to fiscal years beginning
after November15, 2008 for certain non-financial assets and non-financial
liabilities. The Company adopted the
guidance with respect to financial assets and liabilities in 2008. The application of the guidance related to
non-financial assets and liabilities, effective January1, 2009, did not
have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In March2008, the FASB
issued guidance intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by
requiring additional disclosures with respect to derivative instruments and
hedging activities, with particular emphasis as to the effects that such items
have on the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an
entity. The Company adopted the
additional disclosure provisions in the first quarter of 2009. See Note 5 for information regarding the
Companys derivative instruments and hedging activities. In
June2008, the FASB issued guidance stating that unvested share-based
payment awards which contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends
whether paid or unpaid are participating securities, and should be included
in the two-class method of computing earnings per share. This guidance is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December31,2008 and for interim periods within
those years. The adoption of the
guidance did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial
statements. In
December2008, the FASB amended the disclosure requirements for employers
disclosure of plan assets for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
plans. The objective of the additional
disclosure requirements is to provide users of financial statements with an
understanding of how investment allocation decisions are made, the major
categories of plan assets held by the plans, the inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets, significant concentration
of risk within the Companys plan assets, and for fair value measurements
determined using significant unobservable inputs a reconciliation of changes
between the beginning and ending balances.
The additional disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years
ending after December15,2009.
The implementation of the additional disclosure requirements did not
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See also Note 9 of the notes to the
consolidated financial statements for information regarding the plan assets. In
April2009, the FASB issued additional guidance on factors to consider in
estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market
activity for a financial asset. The
additional guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June15,
2009 and it did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. In
April2009, the FASB issued guidance that requires publicly-traded
companies to provide disclosures on the fair value of financial instruments in
interim and annual financial statements.
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June15,2009. The required disclosures are provided in Note
5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In
April2009, the FASB issued guidance related to business combinations that
amends and clarifies application issues associated with initial recognition and
measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets
and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. It is effective for assets or liabilities
arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition
date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period
beginning on or after December15, 2008.
The revised guidance will 53 Table of Contents impact
the accounting and disclosures arising from contingencies in business
combinations and the effect will be dependent upon the acquisitions at that
time. In
May2009, the FASB issued guidance that establishes general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are filed with the SEC. The guidance defines subsequent events and
also required that companies disclose the date through which they have
evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date. The guidance is effective for financial
statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after June15,
2009. In February2010,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2010-09, Subsequent Events Topic 855, which amends Topic 855 to remove
the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose the date through which subsequent
events have been evaluated. The
adoption of the guidance did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated
financial statements. See also
Subsequent Events section below. In
September2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU
2009-12, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures 
Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share. ASU 2009-12 allows, as a practical expedient,
companies that have investments that are within the scope of this ASU to use
net asset value per share of the investment as a fair value measurement without
further adjustment. The Company adopted
this standard, which applies to certain benefit plan assets, in 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact
on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Subsequent
events Subsequent events have been evaluated through the filing of this Form10-K
with the SEC. NOTE 3 Acquisitions On February12, 2007, the Company
acquired the food business assets of SPI Polyols, a subsidiary of ABF North
America Holdings,Inc., and the common shares of an SPI unit that owned
the 50 percent of Getec Guanabara Quimica Industrial S.A. GETEC not
previously held by Corn Products International.
GETEC is a major Brazilian producer of polyols, including liquid
sorbitol and mannitol, and anhydrous dextrose, for the personal care, food,
candy and confectionary, and pharmaceutical markets. The Company paid approximately $66 million in
cash to complete this acquisition, which was accounted for under the purchase
method of accounting. Goodwill of
approximately $43 million was recorded.
Effective with the acquisition, GETEC, which was previously accounted
for as a non-controlled affiliate under the equity method, became a
wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company. The
Company also made other acquisitions during the last three years, none of
which, either individually or in the aggregate, were material. All of the Companys acquisitions were accounted for
under the purchase method. Had the
acquisitions described above occurred at the beginning of the respective years,
the effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements would not have
been significant. NOTE 4 Asset Impairment and Restructurings Charges In the second quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a $125 million
charge to its Statement of Income for impaired assets and restructuring
costs. The charge includes the write-off
of $119 million of goodwill pertaining to the Companys operations in South
Korea and a $5 million charge to write-off impaired assets in North
America. Additionally, the Company
recorded a $1 million charge for employee severance and related benefit costs
primarily attributable to the termination of employees in its Asia/Africa
region. As of December31, 2009,
the employee terminations were completed and the restructuring accrual was
fully utilized. Goodwill is tested for impairment using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of the
reporting unit is compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit
exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, goodwill is not considered
impaired and no further testing is required.
If the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of the
reporting unit, a second step of the impairment assessment is performed in
order to determine the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill. Determining the implied fair value of
goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting units tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price
in a business combination. If the
carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value
of its goodwill, goodwill is deemed impaired and is written down to the extent
of the difference. 54 Table of Contents The
Companys goodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December31,2008
did not result in any impairment charges.
However, due to the operating performance and expectations regarding
future operating performance of the Korean operations Korea at that time,
the fair value of Koreas assets was only modestly in excess of their carrying
value. As part of the Korean goodwill
impairment assessment for the year ended December31, 2008, the Company
specifically made the following operating assumptions for Korea: a reduction of
corn costs and freight rates to historical levels; recovery of high fructose
corn syrup sales volume to the carbonated beverage industry; recovery of starch
volume to the paper industry and glucose volumes to distributors; and the
introduction of new products into the Korean market. During
the second quarter of 2009, the Company reviewed the status of the Korean
operations. While both corn costs and
freight rates were trending down to historical levels, the other operating
assumptions were not moving forward as anticipated. Most significantly, the Company determined
that the Korean operations would not meet sales expectations to the carbonated
beverage industry. This determination
was based on the completion of scheduled negotiations with a significant
customer at the end of the second quarter. As
a result of these triggering events, it was determined that the goodwill
related to the Korean operations should be tested for impairment. In carrying out the first step test, the
Company used a discounted cash flow model DCF model to determine the fair
value of the Korean operation.
Management believes that this approach was appropriate because it
provided a fair value estimate based upon Koreas expected long-term operating
and cash flow performance. This approach
also mitigated most of the impact of cyclical downturns that occur in the
industry. This approach was based on a
ten-year projection of operating results and cash flows that was discounted
using a weighted-average cost of capital. The projection of future cash flows
represented a significant unobservable input a Level 3 input as defined by ASC
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The projection was based upon our best
estimates of projected economic and market conditions over the related period,
including growth rates, estimates of future expected changes in operating
margins and cash expenditures. Other
significant estimates and assumptions included terminal value growth rates and
future capital expenditures. The
Company also considered the market approach, which uses the price relationships
of comparable publicly traded companies to derive an estimated fair value. The results of the market approach supported
the conclusions reached using the DCF model. In
performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test, the results
indicated that the carrying amount of the Korean reporting unit exceeded its
estimated fair value. Therefore, the
second step of the impairment test was performed to determine the implied fair
value of the Korean goodwill. The second step of the impairment test indicated
that the full amount of the Korean goodwill was impaired. The
Company reviews its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. As required under United
States generally accepted accounting principles, the impairment analysis for
long-lived assets occurs before the goodwill impairment assessment. If the carrying amount of an asset or group
of assets exceeds its fair value, the asset may need to be written down to its
fair value. The Company has reviewed its
Korean long-lived assets and has determined that none of those long-lived
assets are impaired. The determination
was based on reviewing the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the Korean
asset group, which were greater than the asset groups carrying value. NOTE 5 Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Hedging Activities The
Company is exposed to market risk stemming from changes in commodity prices
corn and natural gas, foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. In the normal course of business,
the Company actively manages its exposure to these market risks by entering
into various hedging transactions, authorized under established policies that
place clear controls on these activities.
Derivative financial instruments
currently used by the Company consist of commodity futures, options and swap
contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward currency contracts and options. Commodity price hedging: The Companys principal use of derivative
financial instruments is to manage commodity price risk in North America
relating to anticipated purchases of corn and natural gas to be used in the
manufacturing process, generally over the
next twelve to eighteen months.
The Company maintains a commodity-price risk management strategy that
uses derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings 55 Table
of Contents fluctuations caused by commodity-price
volatility. For example, the
manufacturing of the Companys products requires a significant volume of corn
and natural gas. Price fluctuations in
corn and natural gas cause the actual purchase price of corn and natural gas to
differ from anticipated prices. To
manage price risk related to corn purchases in North America, the Company uses
corn futures and options contracts that
trade on regulated commodity exchanges to lock in its corn costs
associated with firm-priced customer sales contracts. The Company uses over-the-counter gas swaps to hedge a portion of its natural gas usage in
North America. These derivative
financial instruments limit the volatility that fluctuations in market
prices will have on corn and natural gas purchases and have been designated as
cash flow hedges. Unrealized gains and losses associated with
marking the commodity hedging contracts to market are recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income OCI and included in the equity section of the
Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of accumulated other comprehensive
income/loss AOCI. These amounts are
subsequently reclassified into earnings in the month in which the related corn
or natural gas is used or in the month a hedge is determined to be
ineffective. The Company assesses
the effectiveness of a commodity hedge contract based on changes in the
contracts fair value. The changes in the market value of such contracts
have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, highly effective at
offsetting changes in the price of the hedged items. The amounts representing the ineffectiveness
of these cash flow hedges are not significant. At December31, 2009, the Companys accumulated
other comprehensive loss account included $33 million of losses, net of tax of
$24 million, pertaining to commodities related derivative instruments that
hedge the anticipated cash flows from future transactions, most of which are
expected to be recognized in earnings within the next twelve months. Transactions and events expected to occur
over the next twelve months that will necessitate reclassifying these
derivative losses to earnings include the sale of finished goods inventory that
includes previously hedged purchases of corn and the usage of hedged natural
gas. Cash flow hedges discontinued
during 2009 were not material. Interest rate hedging:
The Company assesses its exposure to variability in interest rates by
continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rates that may
adversely impact future cash flows and the fair value of existing debt
instruments, and by evaluating hedging opportunities. The Company maintains risk management control
systems to monitor interest rate risk attributable to both the Companys
outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as the Companys offsetting
hedge positions. The risk management
control systems involve the use of analytical techniques, including sensitivity
analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on the
fair value of the Companys outstanding and forecasted debt instruments. Derivative financial instruments used by the Company to
manage its interest rate risk consist of Treasury Lock agreements T-Locks
and interest rate swaps. The Company periodically enters into
T-Locks to fix the benchmark component of the interest rate to be established
for certain planned fixed-rate debt issuances see also Note 6. The T-Locks are designated as hedges of the
variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments caused by
market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate until the fixed interest
rate is established, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the
T-Locks are recorded to other comprehensive income loss until the
consummation of the underlying debt offering, at which time any realized gain
loss is amortized to earnings over the life of the debt. The net gain or loss recognized in earnings
during 2009, 2008 and 2007, representing the amount of the Companys hedges
ineffectiveness, was not significant.
The Company has also, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap
agreements that effectively converted the interest rate on certain fixed-rate
debt to a variable rate. These swaps
called for the Company to receive interest at a fixed rate and to pay interest
at a variable rate, thereby creating the equivalent of variable-rate debt. The Company designated these interest rate
swap agreements as hedges of the changes in fair value of the underlying debt
obligation attributable to changes in interest rates and accounted for them as
fair value hedges. Changes in the fair
value of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively
offset the variability in the fair value of outstanding debt obligations are
reported in earnings. These amounts
offset the gain or loss that is, the change in fair value of the hedged debt
instrument that is attributable to changes in interest rates that is, the
hedged risk which is also recognized in earnings. The Company did not have any interest rate
swap agreements outstanding at December31, 2009, 2008 or 2007. In conjunction with a plan to
issue long-term fixed-rate debt and in order to manage exposure to variability
in the benchmark interest rate on which the fixed interest rate of the planned
debt will be based, the Company entered into a Treasury Lock agreement the T-Lock
with respect to $50 million of such future indebtedness. The T 56 Table
of Contents Lock is designated as a hedge
of the variability in cash flows associated with future interest payments
caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate between the time
the T-Lock was entered and the time the debt is priced. It is accounted for as a cash flow
hedge. The T-Lock expired on April30,
2009 and the Company paid approximately $6 million, representing the losses on
the T-Lock, to settle the agreements.
The $6 million loss was recorded to AOCI and will be amortized to
financing costs over the term of the long-term fixed-rate debt that we plan to
issue. If the Company does not issue new
debt, then it may be required to reclassify a portion of the deferred loss on
the T-Lock from AOCI into earnings. At
December31, 2009, the Companys AOCI account included $5 million of
losses net of tax of $3 million related to T-Locks, of which $3 million net
of tax of $2 million related to the $50 million T-Lock. Cash flow hedges discontinued during 2009
were not material. Foreign currency hedging: Due to the Companys global
operations, it is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. As a result, the Company has
exposure to translational foreign exchange risk when its foreign operation
results are translated to US dollars USD and to transactional foreign
exchange risk when transactions not denominated in the functional currency of
the operating unit are revalued. The
Company primarily uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign
currency forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its transactional
foreign exchange risk. These derivative
financial instruments are primarily accounted for as fair value hedges. As of December31, 2009, the Company had
$22 million of net notional foreign currency forward contracts that hedged net
liability transactional exposures. By using derivative financial instruments to
hedge exposures, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market
risk. Credit risk is the risk that the
counterparty will fail to perform under the terms of the derivative
contract. When the fair value of a derivative
contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit
risk for the Company. When the fair
value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty
and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. The Company minimizes the credit risk in
derivative instruments by entering into over-the-counter transactions only with
investment grade counterparties or by utilizing exchange-traded derivatives.
Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that
results from a change in commodity prices or interest rates. The market risk associated with
commodity-price and interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and
monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may
be undertaken. The fair value and balance sheet location of the Companys
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are presented below

inputs consist of quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable
for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly for substantially the
full term of the financial instrument.
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities
in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities
in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable for the asset or liability or can be derived principally from or
corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs shall be used to measure
fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby
allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for
the asset or liability at the measurement date. The
carrying values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and
short-term borrowings approximate fair values.
Commodity futures, options and swap contracts, which are
designated as hedges of specific volumes of commodities are recognized at fair
value. Foreign currency forward
contracts, swaps and options hedge transactional foreign exchange risk related
to assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency and are recognized at fair value.
The Companys treasury lock agreements, which lock the benchmark rate
for an anticipated fixed rate borrowing, are recognized at fair value. The fair
value of the Companys long-term debt is estimated based on quotations of major
securities dealers who are market makers in the securities. Presented below are the carrying amounts and
the fair values of the Companys long-term debt at December31, 2009 and

The Companys long-term debt
matures as follows: $109 million in 2012, $200million in 2017 and $100
million in 2037. 59 Table of Contents Corn
Products International,Inc. guarantees certain obligations of its
consolidated subsidiaries, which aggregated $21 million and $51 million at December31,
2009 and 2008, respectively. In
conjunction with the Companys plan to issue long-term fixed-rate debt and in
order to manage its exposure to variability in the benchmark interest rate on
which the fixed interest rate of the planned debt is expected to be based, the
Company entered into a T-Lock with respect to $50 million of such future
indebtedness the T-Lock. The T-Lock
is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with
future interest payments caused by market fluctuations in the benchmark
interest rate between the time the T-Lock was entered and the time the debt is
priced. It is accounted for as a cash
flow hedge. The T-Lock expired on April30,
2009 and the Company paid approximately $6 million, representing the losses on
the T-Lock, to settle the agreements.
The $6 million loss was recorded to the accumulated other comprehensive
loss account in the equity section of the Companys balance sheet and will be
amortized to financing costs over the term of the long-term fixed-rate debt
that the Company plans to issue. If the
Company does not issue new debt, then it may be required to reclassify a
portion of the deferred loss on the T-Lock from the accumulated other
comprehensive loss account into earnings. In
2006, the Company had entered into Treasury Lock agreements the T-Locks
that fixed the benchmark component of the interest rate to be established for
the $200 million 60 percent Senior Notes due April15, 2017. The T-Locks were accounted for as cash flow
hedges. The T-Locks expired on March21,
2007 and the Company paid approximately $5 million, representing the losses on
the T-Locks, to settle the agreements.
The $5 million loss was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss
and is being amortized to financing costs over the term of the $200 million 60
percent Senior Notes due April15, 2017. On
February1, 2006, the Company terminated its remaining fixed to floating
interest rate swap agreements associated with the 845 percent senior
notes. The swap termination resulted in
a gain of approximately $3 million, which approximated the fair value of the
swap contract. The fair value adjustment
to the hedged debt at the termination date $3 million was amortized as a
reduction to financing costs over the remaining term of the underlying debt
through August2009 and has been fully amortized. NOTE 7 - Leases The Company leases rail cars, certain machinery and equipment, and
office space under various operating leases.
Rental expense under operating leases was $29 million, $30 million and

operating loss carryforwards at December31, 2009 include state net
operating losses of $2 million and foreign net operating losses of $21
million. The state net operating losses
expire in various years through 2029. Foreign
net operating losses of $17 million will expire in 2010 through 2014 if unused,
while $4 million may be carried forward indefinitely. The foreign tax credit carryforwards of $24
million at December31, 2009 will expire in 2011 through 2019 if not
utilized. Income
tax accounting requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is
more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be
realized. In making this assessment,
management considers the level of historical taxable income, scheduled reversal
of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future
taxable income. The Company maintains a
valuation allowance of $44 million against certain foreign tax credits, foreign
net operating losses and deferred tax assets in Korea that management has
determined will more likely than not expire prior to realization. The valuation allowance at December31,
2009, with respect to foreign tax credit carryforwards, decreased to $15
million from $19 million at December31, 2008. The valuation allowance with respect to
foreign net operating losses increased to $20 million at December31, 2009
from $7 million at December31, 2008.
In addition, a valuation allowance of $9 million was established during
2009 primarily for the deferred tax asset associated with the future tax
amortization of goodwill in Korea. A

Of
this total, $18 million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits
that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate in future periods. 62 Table of Contents The
Company accounts for interest and penalties related to income tax matters in
income tax expense. The Company had
accrued interest and penalties of $1 million as of December31, 2009 and
$3 million as of December31, 2008. The
Company is subject to US federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple
state and non-US jurisdictions. The
Internal Revenue Service IRS has concluded its audit of all years through
2005. The Company remains subject to
potential examination in Canada for the years 2004 to 2009, Brazil for the
years 2004 to 2009 and Mexico for the years 2005 to 2009. The statute of limitations is generally open
for the years 2002 to 2009 for various other non-US jurisdictions. In
2008 and 2007, the Company made deposits of approximately $13 million and $17
million, respectively, to the Canadian tax authorities relating to an ongoing
audit examination. The Company did not
make any additional deposits relating to this ongoing audit examination in
2009. The Company has settled $2 million
of the claims and is in the process of appealing the remaining items from the
audit. It is expected that the appeal
process will not be concluded within the next twelve months. The Company believes that it has adequately
provided for the most likely outcome of the appeal process. It is reasonably possible
that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease
within twelve months of December31, 2009.
The Company currently estimates that such increases or decreases will
not be significant. NOTE 9 
Benefit Plans The
Company and its subsidiaries sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension
plans covering substantially all employees in the United States and Canada, and
certain employees in other foreign countries. Plans for most salaried employees
provide pay-related benefits based on years of service. Plans for hourly employees generally provide
benefits based on flat dollar amounts and years of service. The Companys general funding policy is to
make contributions to the plans in amounts that are within the limits of
deductibility under current tax regulations.
Certain foreign countries allow income tax deductions without regard to
contribution levels, and the Companys policy in those countries is to make the
contribution required by the terms of the applicable plan. Domestic plan assets consist primarily of
common stock, corporate debt securities and short-term investment funds. Domestic
salaried employees are covered by a defined benefit cash balance pension
plan, which provides benefits based on service and Company credits to the
participating employees accounts of between 3 percent and 10 percent of base
salary, bonus and overtime. The
Company also provides healthcare and/or life insurance benefits for retired
employees in the United States, Canada and Brazil. US salaried employees are
provided with access to postretirement medical insurance through Retirement
Health Care Spending Accounts. US
salaried employees accrue an account during employment, which can be used after
employment to purchase postretirement medical insurance from the Company and
Medigap or through Medicare HMO policies after age 65. The accounts are credited with a flat dollar
amount and indexed for inflation annually during employment. The accounts also
accrue interest credits using a rate equal to a specified amount above the
yield on five-year Treasury notes. Employees
can use the amounts accumulated in these accounts, including credited interest,
to purchase postretirement medical insurance.
Employees become eligible for benefits when they meet minimum age and
service requirements. The Company
recognizes the cost of these postretirement benefits by accruing a flat dollar
amount on an annual basis for each domestic salaried employee. The Company has the right to modify or
terminate these benefits. Healthcare benefits for retirees outside the United
States, Canada and Brazil are generally covered through local government plans. 63 Table

The Company has assumed
an expected long-term rate of return on assets of 725 percent for US plans and
700 percent for Canadian plans. In
developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets,
which consist mainly of US and Canadian equity and debt securities, management
evaluated historical rates of return achieved on plan assets and the asset
allocation of the plans, input from the Companys independent actuaries and investment consultants, and
historical trends in long-term inflation rates.
Projected return estimates made by such consultants are based upon broad
equity and bond indices. The discount rate
reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match
the duration of the expected benefit payments.
The Company has typically used returns on long-term, high quality
corporate AA bonds as a benchmark in establishing this assumption. The discount rate is reviewed annually. Plan Assets - The Companys investment policy for its pension plans is to balance risk
and return through diversified portfolios of equity instruments, fixed income
securities, and short-term investments.
Maturities for fixed income securities are managed such that sufficient
liquidity exists to meet near-term benefit payment obligations. For US pension plans, the weighted average
target range allocation of assets was 41-81 percent with equity managers, 19-59
percent with fixed income managers and 1-3 percent in cash. The asset allocation is reviewed regularly
and portfolio investments are rebalanced to the targeted allocation when
considered appropriate. The Companys pension plan weighted average asset
allocation for US plans and non-US plans is as follows

plan assets are held in collective trusts by the Companys US and non-US plans
the Plan. The fair values of shares
of collective trusts are based upon the net asset values of the funds reported
by the fund managers as of the balance sheet date level 2 inputs. This may produce a fair value calculation
that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair
values. Furthermore, while the Plan
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of
other market participants, the use of different methodologies could result in a
different fair value measurement at the reporting date. 67 Table of Contents In 2009, the Company made
cash contributions of $7 million and $5 million to its US and non-US pension
plans, respectively. The Company
anticipates that it will make cash contributions of $8 million to its non-US
pension plans in 2010. The Company has
not yet determined the amount, if any, that it will contribute to its US
pension plans in 2010. Cash
contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including
the performance of plan assets. The

The discount rate
reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match
the duration of expected benefit payments.
The Company has typically used returns on long-term, high-quality
corporate AA bonds as a benchmark in establishing this assumption. The discount rate is reviewed annually. In measuring the
postretirement benefit obligation, for the United States, the Company assumed
an increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits of 90 percent in
2010, declining ratably to 50 percent by the year 2018 and remaining at that
level thereafter. The US Salaried OPEB Plan post-65 trend rate is assumed to be
35 percent per year. For Canada, the Company assumed an increase in the per
capita cost of healthcare benefits of 80 percent in 2010, declining ratably to
50 percent by the year 2013 and remaining at that level thereafter. In
addition, for Canada, the Company assumed an increase in the per capita cost of
dental benefits of 40 percent per year. The Canada London Union Plan is not
affected by health care trend rates. For Brazil, the Company assumed an
increase in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits of 100 percent in 2010 69 Table of Contents declining ratably to 55
percent by the year 2019 and remaining at that level thereafter. An increase in the assumed healthcare cost
trend rate by 1 percentage point would increase the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation at December31, 2009 by $11 million, while a decrease
in the rate of 1 percentage point would decrease the obligation by $9 million,
with a corresponding effect on the service and interest cost components of the
net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended of $11
million for an increase of 1 percentage point and $08 million for a decrease
of 1 percentage point. Estimated future benefit
payments The following benefit payments, which reflect anticipated future
service, as appropriate, are expected to be made under the Companys

The Medicare Prescription
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 provides a federal subsidy to
employers sponsoring retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit
that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare PartD. The Company receives a Medicare PartD
subsidy for certain retirees. The impact of the Medicare PartD subsidy is
immaterial for benefit payment cash flows. 70 Table of Contents NOTE 10 Supplementary Information Balance Sheets Supplementary information is set forth below

June23, 2008, the Company and Bunge Limited Bunge announced that the
two companies had entered into a definitive agreement under which Bunge would
acquire Corn Products in an all-stock transaction. The aggregate transaction value based on the
price of Bunges stock at that date was approximately $48 billion including
assumption of debt. On November10,
2008, the Companys Board of Directors withdrew its recommendation in favor of
the merger agreement and recommended against adoption of the agreement. On the same day Bunges Board of Directors
voted to terminate the merger agreement, citing the decision of the Corn
Products Board of Directors. Under the
terms of the agreement, the Company reimbursed Bunge for $10 million of their
expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition. In addition, the Company incurred
approximately $6 million of expenses relating to the proposed transaction. bInterest
capitalized amounted to $7 million, $8 million and $4 million in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. 72 Table of Contents Statements

Natural
Gas Purchase Agreement On
January20, 2006, Corn Products Brazil CPO Brazil, the Companys
wholly-owned Brazilian subsidiary entered into a Natural Gas Purchase and Sale
Agreement the Agreement with Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo Comgas Comgas. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,
Comgas supplies natural gas to the cogeneration facility at CPO Brazils Mogi
Guacu plant. This agreement will expire
on March31, 2023, unless extended or terminated under certain conditions
specified in the Agreement. During the
term of the Agreement, CPO Brazil is obligated to purchase from Comgas, and
Comgas is obligated to provide to CPO Brazil, certain minimum quantities of
natural gas that are specified in the Agreement. The price for such quantities of natural gas
is determined pursuant to a formula set forth in the Agreement. The price may vary based upon gas commodity
cost and transportation costs, which are adjusted annually; the distribution
margin which is set by the Brazilian Commission of Public Energy Services; and
the fluctuation of exchange rates between the US dollar and the Brazilian
real. We estimate that the total minimum
expenditures by CPO Brazil through the remaining term of the Agreement will be
approximately $236 million based on current exchange rates as of December31,
2009 and estimates regarding the application of the formula set forth in the
Agreement, spread evenly over the remaining term of the Agreement. CPO Brazil will make payments of
approximately $18 million in each of the next five years in accordance with the
Agreement. The amount of gas purchased
under this Agreement for the years ended December31,2009, 2008 and
2007 was approximately $21 million, $22 million and $20 million, respectively. NOTE 11 Redeemable Common Stock The
Company had an agreement with certain common stockholders collectively the holder,
relating to 500,000 shares of the Companys common stock, that provided the
holder with the right to require the Company to repurchase those common shares
for cash at a price equal to the average of the closing per share market price
of the Companys common stock for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the
date that the holder exercised the put option.
This put option was exercisable at any time, until January2010,
when it expired. The holder could have
also elected to sell the common shares on the open market, subject to certain
restrictions. The common shares that
were subject to the put option are classified as redeemable common stock in the
Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As a result of the expiration of the agreement, the Company will
discontinue reporting the shares as redeemable common stock in its Consolidated
Balance Sheet in 2010 and reclassify the amount to additional paid-in capital. During
the term of the agreement, the Company had the right, but not the obligation,
to extend the put option for an additional three years. Additionally, the holder of the put option
could not require the Company to repurchase less than 500,000 shares on any
single exercise of the option. In the
event the holder had exercised the put option requiring the Company to
repurchase the shares, the Company would have been required to pay for the
shares within 90 calendar days from the exercise date. Any amount due would have accrued interest at
the Companys revolving credit facility rate from the date of exercise until
the payment date. The put option has not
been extended and has expired. The
carrying value of the redeemable common stock was $14 million at both December31,
2009 and December31, 2008, based on the average of the closing per share
market prices of the Companys common stock for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding the respective balance sheet dates $2903 per share and $2862 per
share at December31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Adjustments to mark the redeemable common
stock to market value are recorded directly to additional paid-in capital in
the equity section of the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2007, the holder sold 727,000 shares
of redeemable common stock in open market transactions. There were 500,000 shares of redeemable common
stock outstanding at December31, 2009 and 2008. 73 Table of
Contents NOTE 12 - Equity Preferred stock The Company has authorized 25 million shares of $001
par value preferred stock, none of which were issued or outstanding as of December31,
2009 and December31, 2008. Treasury Stock During 2009, the Company issued, from treasury, 83,700 restricted common
shares and 287,150 common shares upon the exercise of stock options under the
stock incentive plan and 146,859 common shares under other incentive
plans. During 2008, the Company issued,
from treasury, 45,500 restricted common shares and 583,835 common shares upon
the exercise of stock options under the stock incentive plan and 206,582 common
shares under other incentive plans.
During 2007, the Company issued, from treasury, 77,950 restricted common
shares and 875,774 common shares upon the exercise of stock options under the
stock incentive plan and 7,027 common shares under other incentive plans. The Company reacquired 17,191, 18,527 and 32,040 shares
of its common stock during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, by both
repurchasing shares from employees under the stock incentive plan and through
the cancellation of forfeited restricted stock.
The Company repurchased shares from employees at average purchase prices
of $2976, $3396 and $4488, or fair value at the date of purchase, during
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. All
of the acquired shares are held as common stock in treasury, less shares issued
to employees under the stock incentive plan. On November7,
2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a common stock repurchase
program that permits the Company to purchase up to 5 million shares of its
outstanding common stock over a period that runs through November30,
2010. In 2009, the Company repurchased
157,508 common shares in open market transactions at a cost of approximately $3
million. In 2008, the Company repurchased
25,000 common shares in open market transactions at a cost of approximately $1
million. In 2007, the Company
repurchased 1,480,500 common shares in open market transactions at a cost of
approximately $55 million. Substantially
all of the 2007 repurchases were made under the Companys previously authorized
4 million share repurchase program, except for 32,100 shares that were
repurchased under the existing 5 million share program. At December31, 2009, the Company had
4,785,392 shares available to be repurchased under its existing program. The Company has repurchased all of the shares
allowed under its previously authorized 4 million share repurchase
program. The parameters of the Companys stock repurchase
program are not established solely with reference to the dilutive impact of
shares issued under the Companys stock incentive plan. However, the Company expects that, over time,
share repurchases will offset the dilutive impact of shares issued under the
stock incentive plan. 74 Table of Contents Set

Share-based payments The Company has a stock incentive plan SIP
administered by the compensation committee of its Board of Directors that
provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and other
stock-based awards to certain key employees.
A maximum of 8million shares were originally authorized for awards
under the SIP. As of December31,2009,
23millionshares were available for future grants under the
SIP. Shares covered by awards that
expire, terminate or lapse will again be available for the grant of awards
under the SIP. Total share-based
compensation expense for 2009 was $6million, net of income tax effect of
$4 million. Total share-based
compensation expense for 2008 was $9million, net of income tax effect of
$4 million. The Company granted nonqualified options to purchase
898,700, 812,800 and 777,600 shares of the Companys common stock during 2009,
2008 and 2007, respectively. The options are exercisable upon vesting, which
occurs for grants issued in 2009, 2008 and 2007 evenly over a three-year period
at the anniversary dates of the date of grant, and have a term of 10
years. Stock options granted prior to
2007 are exercisable upon vesting, which occurs in 50 percent increments at the
one and two year anniversary dates of the date of grant, and also have a term
of 10 years. Compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis for awards.
As of December31, 2009, certain of these nonqualified options have
been forfeited due to the termination of employees. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at
the grant dates using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following

The
expected life of options represents the weighted average period of time that
options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting
schedules and the Companys historical exercise patterns. The risk-free interest rate is based on the
US Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant for periods
corresponding with the expected life of the options. Expected volatility is based on historical
volatilities of the Companys common stock.
Dividend yields are based on historical dividend payments. The weighted
average fair value of options granted during 2009, 2008 and 2007 was estimated
to be $636, $906 and $1033, respectively. 75 Table

The
number of options exercisable at December31, 2009 was 34 million. Stock
options outstanding at December31, 2009 had an aggregate intrinsic value
of approximately $26 million and an average remaining contractual life of 60
years. Stock options exercisable at December31,
2009 had an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $23 million and an
average remaining contractual life of 49 years. Stock options outstanding at December31,
2008 had an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $26 million and an
average remaining contractual life of 62 years. Stock options exercisable at December31,
2008 had an aggregate intrinsic value of approximately $26 million and an
average remaining contractual life of 51 years. In addition to stock options, the Company awards shares
of restricted common stock to certain key employees. The restricted shares issued
under the plan are subject to cliff vesting, generally for five years provided
the employee remains in the service of the Company. Expense is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period taking into account an estimated forfeiture
rate. The fair value of the restricted
stock is determined based upon the number of shares granted 76 Table
of Contents and
the quoted market price of the Companys common stock at the date of the
grant. Compensation expense pertaining
to these awards was $2 million in 2009 and $1 million in both 2008 and 2007. The

The
weighted-average fair value of restricted stock granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $2585, $3436 and $3443, respectively.
The total fair value of restricted stock that vested in 2009, 2008 and
2007 was $3 million, $1 million and $1 million, respectively. As
of December31, 2009, additional paid-in capital included $3 million of
unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that will be
amortized on a weighted-average basis over 19 years. The recognized compensation cost related to
restricted stock totaling $4 million at December31, 2009 is included in
share-based payments subject to redemption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other
share-based awards under the SIP Under
the compensation agreement with the Board of Directors at least 50 percent of a
directors compensation is awarded based on each directors election to receive
such compensation in the form of restricted stock units, which track investment
returns to changes in value of the Companys common stock with dividends being
reinvested. Stock units under this plan
vest immediately. The compensation
expense relating to this plan included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was not material.
At December31, 2009, there were approximately 227,000 share units
outstanding under this plan at a carrying value of approximately $7 million. The
Company has a long term incentive plan for officers under which awards
thereunder are classified as equity. The
ultimate payment of the performance shares will be based 50 percent on the
Companys stock performance as compared to the stock performance of a peer
group and 50 percent on a return on capital employed versus the target
percentage. Compensation expense for the
stock performance portion of the plan is based on the fair value of the plan
that is determined on the day the plan is established. The fair value is
calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for the return on
capital employed portion of the plan is based on the probability of attaining
the target percentage goal and is reviewed at the end of each reporting
period. The total compensation expense
for these awards is being amortized over a three-year service period. Compensation expense relating to these awards
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
$5 million, $5million and $5 million, respectively. As of December31, 2009, the
unrecognized compensation cost relating to these plans was $3 million, which
will be amortized over the remaining requisite service periods of 1 to 2
years. This amount will vary each
reporting period based on changes in the probability of attaining the goal. The recognized compensation cost related to
these awards totaling $4 million at December31, 2009 is included in
share-based payments subject to redemption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 77 Table

NOTE 13 Mexican Tax on Beverages
Sweetened with HFCS On
January1, 2002, a discriminatory tax on beverages sweetened with high
fructose corn syrup HFCS approved by the Mexican Congress late in 2001,
became effective. In response to the
enactment of the tax, which at the time effectively ended the use of HFCS for
beverages in Mexico, the Company ceased production of HFCS 55 at its
SanJuan del Rio plant, one of its three plants in Mexico. Over time, the Company resumed production and
sales of HFCS and by 2006 had returned to levels attained prior to the
imposition of the tax as a result of certain customers having obtained court
rulings exempting them from paying the tax.
The Mexican Congress repealed this tax effective January1, 2007. On
October21, 2003, the Company submitted, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its Mexican affiliate, CPIngredientes, S.A. de C.V. previously known as
Compania Proveedora de Ingredientes, a Request for Institution of Arbitration
Proceedings Submitted Pursuant to Chapter11 of the North American Free
Trade Agreement NAFTA the Request. The Request was submitted to the
Additional Office of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes and was brought against the United Mexican States. In the Request, the Company asserted that the
imposition by Mexico of a discriminatory tax on beverages containing HFCS in
force from 2002 through 2006 breached various obligations of Mexico under the
investment protection provisions of NAFTA.
The case was bifurcated into two phases, liability and damages, and a
hearing on liability was held before a Tribunal in July2006. In a Decision dated January15, 2008,
the Tribunal unanimously held that Mexico had violated NAFTA Article1102,
National Treatment, by treating beverages sweetened with HFCS produced by
foreign companies differently than those sweetened with domestic sugar. In July2008, a hearing regarding the
quantum of damages was held before the same Tribunal. The Company sought damages and pre- and
post-judgment interest totaling $288 million through December31, 2008. In
an award rendered August18, 2009, the Tribunal awarded damages to
CPIngredientes in the amount of $584 million, representing lost profits in
Mexico as a result of the tax and certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
CPIngredientes, 78 Table
of Contents together
with accrued interest. On October1,
2009, the Company submitted to the Tribunal a request for correction of the
Award to avoid effective double taxation on the amount of the Award in
Mexico. On November16, 2009, the
Company preserved its appeal rights by entering a Notice of Application in the
Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, Canada pending the outcome of the request
for correction or interpretation. The
damages awarded by the Tribunal have not been recorded in the Companys
consolidated financial statements. NOTE 14 - Segment Information The
