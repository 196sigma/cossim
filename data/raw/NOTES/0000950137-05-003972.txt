PART II
Item5. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES aEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule13a-15e or 15d-15e under the Exchange Act. Based upon that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the
end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in
timely alerting them to the material information related to us or our consolidated subsidiaries
required to be included in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. bChanges in Internal Controls. During the most recent fiscal quarter covered by this
report, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f under the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART III Certain information required by PartIII is incorporated by reference from our definitive
Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for our 2005 Annual Meeting of Stockholders currently expected to be held
on May24, 2005 the Proxy Statement.
