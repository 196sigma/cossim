Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsYAHOO!INC. 
Note1 THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company.Yahoo!Inc. Yahoo! or the Company is a leading provider of comprehensive online products and services to consumers
and businesses worldwide. The Company, a Delaware corporation, commenced operations in 1995. 
Principles of Consolidation.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Yahoo! and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities in which the Company can exercise significant influence, but are less than majority owned and not
otherwise controlled by the Company, are accounted for under the equity method. 
Reclassifications.Certain prior years' balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
Revenue Recognition.The Company revenues are derived principally from services, which include marketing services, fees, and listings. 
Marketing
services revenues are primarily generated from the sale of banner, sponsorship, text-link advertisements, including sponsored search advertisements, and transaction revenues.
Banner advertising agreements typically range from one week to three years. The Company recognizes marketing services revenues related to banner advertisements as impressions are delivered by the
Company. Impressions are defined as the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the Yahoo! network. Sponsorship advertising agreements have longer terms than banner
advertising agreements, typically ranging from three months to three years, and often involve multiple element arrangements that may include
placement on specific properties, exclusivity and content integration. Sponsorship advertisement revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered or ratably over the contract period, where
applicable, and when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Text-link advertisements, including sponsored searches, are recognized as the net amount earned in the
period in which the click-throughs occur. Click-throughs are defined as the number of times a user clicks on an advertisement or search result. Transactions revenues include service fees for
facilitating transactions through the Yahoo! network, principally from the Company commerce properties. Transactions revenues are recognized when there is evidence that the qualifying transactions
have occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue on these arrangements in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No101 SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. In all cases, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of
an arrangement exists, the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenues from sponsored search and media from the Company agreement with
Overture Services,Inc. Overture are included in marketing services for the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001. Revenues from Overture amounted to 14% of net revenues for the
year ended December31, 2002. No one customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues during 2001 and 2000. 
Periodically,
the Company engages in barter transactions for marketing services. Barter revenue is recognized over the periods in which the Company completes its obligations under the arrangement. In
January2000, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No99-17 EITF99-17, Accounting for Advertising Barter Transactions, which
requires advertising barter transactions to be valued based on similar cash transactions that have occurred within six months prior to the barter transaction. Barter revenues represented 2%, 7%, and
7% of total revenues for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company delivered approximately 35billion, 16billion and 11billion impressions,
respectively, under barter arrangements where fair value was not determinable under EITF99-17 and, accordingly, revenue was not recognized. 
Fees
revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business fee-based services, including 
46  SBC Yahoo! DSL and Dial, Yahoo! Personals, Small Business Services, Yahoo! Mail and Yahoo! Enterprise Solutions. With the exception of Yahoo! Portal Solutions, revenues are recognized in the month in
which the services are performed, provided that no significant Company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Revenues from Yahoo! Portal Solutions
consist of software license and service revenues, which are principally platform and maintenance services. Yahoo! Portal Solutions revenue is recognized in accordance with Statement of Position
No97-2, Software Revenue Recognition and Statement of Position98-9, Modification of SOP No97-2 with Respect to Certain Transactions.
License revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of the license has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. License revenues
from Portal Solutions were not material to the Company as they represented less than 1% of total net revenue for all periods presented. Platform services are sold as a subscription and are recognized
ratably over the subscription period. Platform services are priced based on the specific content or service purchased by the customer. These services are optional and renewable annually at fixed
renewal rates. Maintenance is generally sold under annual contracts with fixed renewal rates. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. Yahoo! Portal Solutions revenues have
represented less than 10% of total net revenues in all periods presented. 
Listings
revenues consist of revenues generated from a variety of consumer and business listings-based services, including access to the HotJobs database and classifieds such as Yahoo! Autos, Yahoo!
Real Estate and other Search and Directory services. Revenues are recognized in the month in which the services are performed, provided that no significant Company obligations remain and collection of
the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. 
Deferred
revenue primarily comprises contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short and Long-Term Investments.The Company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the U.S.
Government and its agencies, and in high-quality corporate issuers. All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Investments with maturities of less than twelve months from the balance sheet date are considered short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than twelve months from the
balance sheet date are considered long-term investments. 
The
Company marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in other
comprehensive income loss. Realized gains or losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are reported in other
income loss. The Company reviews the securities for impairments considering current factors including the economic environment, market conditions and the operational performance and other specific
factors relating to the business underlying the securities. The Company records impairment charges equal to the amount that the cost basis in its available-for-sale securities
exceeds the estimated fair market value of the securities as of the evaluation date. The fair value for publicly held securities is determined based on quoted market prices as of the evaluation date.
In computing realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, the Company determines cost based on amounts paid, including direct costs such as commissions, to
acquire the security using the specific identification method. The Company recorded $86million, $106million and $992million of unrealized losses during the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Company had unrealized gains on its marketable debt and equity securities of approximately $179million, $321million and
$498million net of tax of $72million, $128million and $199million, at December31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. 
The
Company has investments in equity instruments of privately-held companies. These investments are included in other long-term assets and are generally accounted for under
the cost method, as the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations. The Company monitors its investments for impairment by considering current factors
including economic environment, market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment, and records reductions in carrying values
when necessary. The fair value for privately held securities is estimated using the best available information as of the evaluation date, including the quoted market prices of comparable public
companies, recent financing rounds of the investee and other investee specific information, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion 
47  No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. 
The
Company accounts for derivatives under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133 SFAS133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
SFAS133 establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. The derivatives held by
the Company comprise warrants to purchase equity instruments in other public and private companies at specified prices over terms varying from 25 to 10years. These warrants are held for
business and strategic purposes. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company recorded in other income, gains on derivatives of approximately $02million, $46million and
$31million, respectively. 
Concentration of Risk.Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist
primarily of cash, cash equivalents, investments, and accounts receivable. As of December31, 2002, substantially all of the Company cash, cash equivalents, and investments were managed by
five financial institutions. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers primarily located in the United States. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and maintains
allowances for potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within management expectations. As of December31, 2002 and 2001, no one customer accounted for 10% or more of the
accounts receivable balance. 
Product Development.Product development costs consist primarily of payroll and related expenses incurred for enhancements to and
maintenance of the Company network, classification and organization of listings within Yahoo! properties, research and development expenses, amortization of capitalized Website development costs,
and other operating costs. 
Internal Use Software and Website Development Costs.The Company has capitalized certain internal use software and Website development costs
totaling $112million and $86million during 2002 and 2001, respectively. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized is evaluated for each specific project and ranges from one to
three years. During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the amortization of capitalized costs totaled $89million, $47million and $17million, respectively. 
Advertising Costs.Advertising production costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement appears. All other advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense, including barter advertising, totaled approximately $938million, $1135million, and $1748million for 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. 
Benefit Plan.The Company maintains a 401k Profit Sharing Plan the Plan for its full-time employees. Each participant in
the Plan may elect to contribute from 1% to 17% of his or her annual compensation to the Plan. The Company matches employee contributions at a rate of 25%. Employee contributions are fully vested,
whereas vesting in matching Company contributions occurs at a rate of 333% per year of employment. During 2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company contributions amounted to $33million 28million, and $24million, respectively. 
Depreciation and Amortization.Buildings are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of 25years. Leasehold improvements, computers and equipment, and furniture and fixtures are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. 
Goodwill
and other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the economic lives of the respective
assets, generally three to ten years. Effective January1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142 SFAS142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. In accordance with SFAS142, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill and performed a transitional test of its goodwill as of January1, 2002. See
Note4 Goodwill. SFAS142 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment
on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances. The performance of the test involves a two-step process. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the
fair value of the Company reporting units with the reporting unit carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using the 
48  expected present value of future cash flows, giving consideration to the market comparable approach. If the carrying amount of the Company reporting units exceeds the reporting unit fair value,
the Company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair
value of the Company reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. 
Long-Lived Assets.Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted
future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition.
Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset. 
Other Income Loss, net.Other income loss, net was as follows in thousands: Years Ended December 31 2002 
2001 
2000 Interest income 63,200 91,931 84,602 Investment gains losses, net 2,189 26,623 118,943 Contract termination fees 1,661 9,000 Earnings in equity interests Note8 22,301 4,356 1,428 Other 2,237 1,526 788 91,588 77,138 33,701 Investment gains losses, net include investment gains, investment losses, gains on derivatives and impairment charges related to declines in values of
publicly traded securities and securities of privately held companies judged to be other than temporary. 
Investment
gains were $88million in 2002, partially offset by impairment charges on privately held securities of $62million. Investment losses in 2001 were $266million, of
which approximately $128million relates to investment impairments on publicly traded securities and $252million relates to investment impairments on privately held securities, offset
by a gain of $52million related to the sale of certain equity investments and approximately $46million of gains on derivatives related to equity instruments of other companies.
Investment losses in 2000 were $1189million, of which approximately $1398million relates to investment impairments on publicly traded securities and $234million relates to
investment impairments on privately held securities, partially offset by a gain of approximately $408million related to the exchange of certain equity investments. 
Income Taxes.Deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are not expected
to be realized. 
Foreign Currency.The functional currency of the Company international subsidiaries is the local currency. The financial statements of
these subsidiaries are translated to United States dollars using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and
expenses. Translation gains losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a component of stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange
transactions are included in other income loss, net and were not significant during the periods presented. 
Basic and Diluted Net Income Loss per Share.Basic net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the
period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon conversion of convertible Preferred Stock using the if-converted method and shares issuable upon
the exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method. For 2002 and 2000, potential common shares of 162million and 600million, respectively, were included in
the computation and were related to shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options. For 2001, potential common shares of approximately 268million shares were not included in the
computation because they were antidilutive. 
49  Stock Based Compensation.The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. If the fair value based method had been applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net income loss and net income loss per share would have been as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December 31 2002 
2001 
2000 Net income loss As reported 42,815 92,788 70,776 Stock compensation expense, net of tax 482,918 890,407 1,335,763 Pro forma 440,103 983,195 1,264,987 Net income loss per share As reported basic 007 016 013 Pro forma basic 074 173 230 As reported diluted 007 016 012 Pro forma diluted 074 173 230 Diluted net loss per share for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 is computed excluding common share equivalents of 162million,
268million and 600million shares, respectively, as their effect is anti-dilutive. 
See
Note10 Stockholders' Equity for the assumptions and methodology used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation. 
Use of Estimates.The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables,
investment values, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring costs and contingencies. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
Comprehensive Income Loss.Comprehensive income loss as defined, includes all changes in equity net assets during a period from
non-owner sources. Accumulated other comprehensive income loss, as presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, consists of the net unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities, net of tax, and the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No146 SFAS146, Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. SFAS146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues
Task Force Issue No94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring. SFAS146 requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is
incurred, rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December31, 2002. The Company
does not expect that the adoption of SFAS146 will have a material impact on the Company financial position or results of operations, although SFAS146 may impact the timing of
recognition of costs associated with future restructuring, exit or disposal activities. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No148 SFAS148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosure An Amendment of FASB Statement No123. SFAS148 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123 SFAS123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS148
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS123 to require prominent disclosures both in annual and interim financial statements 
50  about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company has included the disclosures required by SFAS148 in
Note1 The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note10 Stockholders' Equity. In
November2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No45 FIN45 Guarantor Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others. FIN45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a
guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. However, the provisions related to recognizing a
liability at
inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives. The initial recognition and initial
measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN45 are effective for financial statements
of interim or annual periods ending after December15, 2002. The Company has not yet determined the effect of adopting FIN45 on its results of operations or financial position. 
In
January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46 FIN46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Until this interpretation, a company generally included another
entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests. FIN46 requires a variable interest entity, as defined, to be consolidated by a
company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity residual returns. Management is
currently evaluating the effect of adopting FIN 46 on its results of operations and financial position. 
In
November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No00-21 EITF00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
EITF00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions
of EITF00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003. The Company does not believe the adoption of
EITF00-21 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

primarily includes the reclassification of certain intangibles to goodwill in connection with the adoption of SFAS142 and certain purchase price adjustments to existing
goodwill. See also Note6 Acquisitions. 
The Company performed a transitional impairment test of its goodwill and intangible assets as of January1, 2002. Due to, among other things, the overall
softening of the global economy and the related decline in international advertising, the Company recorded a transitional goodwill impairment loss of $641million, which was recorded during
the first quarter of 2002 as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the Company Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of the reporting unit giving rise to the transitional
impairment loss was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows and market valuation approach. 
Due
to the adoption of SFAS142 on January1, 2002, the Company ceased amortizing goodwill. Had SFAS142 been in effect during the years ended December31, 2001, and 2000,
the Company would not have recorded goodwill amortization expense of $559million and $216million, respectively. The following table summarizes net income loss adjusted to exclude
goodwill amortization expense, and the related tax effect, that is no longer subject to amortization in thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December 31 2002

the Company listings properties and generates revenue primarily through listings and subscription fees for access to HotJobs' database. The acquisition gained the Company meaningful presence in the
online segment of the recruiting marketplace and is consistent with the Company strategy of building a diversified global business, providing solutions for consumers and business partners. These
factors contributed to a purchase price in excess of fair market value of the HotJobs' net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and as a result, the Company has recorded goodwill in connection
with the transaction. 
The
total purchase price of $4391million consisted of $1918million in Yahoo! Common Stock, representing approximately 120million shares, $2066million in cash
consideration, $337million of stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs of $70million. The value of the Common Stock and stock options was determined based on the average
market price of our Common Stock over the 5-day period surrounding the date the terms of the exchange offer were finalized in February2002. 
The
preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of HotJobs was as follows in thousands: Cash acquired 53,284 Other tangible assets acquired 50,697 Amortizable intangible assets 98,600 Goodwill 281,867 Liabilities 49,284 Deferred compensation 3,928 Total 439,092 Although the Company has not finalized the allocation of the purchase price, the Company does not expect the final allocation to differ materially from the
preliminary allocation. 
Amortizable
intangible assets acquired have estimated useful lives as follows: Tradename, trademark and domain name seven years; Customer contracts five to
seven years; Developed technology three to five years. Goodwill of $2819million represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and
intangible assets acquired, and is not deductible for tax purposes. 
The
results of operations of HotJobs' have been included in the Company consolidated statements of operations since the completion of the acquisition on February12, 2002. The following
unaudited pro forma information presents a summary of the results of operations of the Company assuming the acquisition of HotJobs occurred on January1, 2001 in thousands, except per share

54  the Company on either an individual or aggregate basis, and accordingly, pro forma results of operations have not been presented. 
In
January2001, the Company completed the acquisition of Kimo.com, a Taiwanese Internet communications and media company, through the issuance of approximately 22million shares of
Yahoo! Common Stock for a total purchase price of $1574million. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired, principally goodwill and other intangibles of $1539million,
which were being amortized on a straight-line basis between two to four years, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The amortization of
goodwill ceased upon the adoption of SFAS142. 
Poolings of Interests Combinations.There were no acquisitions during 2002 and 2001 that were accounted for as poolings of interests. The

settlement of a facilities lease termination related to the August2000 acquisition of eGroups. For the year ended December31, 2000, acquisition-related charges totaled
$228million related to the acquisitions of Arthas.com and eGroups, which included contracts and facilities termination expenses, write-offs of certain related fixed assets and
leasehold improvements, professional services, severance costs associated with the termination of certain employees with redundant job functions, and various registration and filing fees. As of
December31, 2002, the acquisition costs related to these transactions have been substantially paid. 
The
consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December31, 2002 and the accompanying notes reflect the Company financial position and the results of operations as if
eGroups,Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company since inception. The historical operations of Arthas.com were not material to the Company financial position, results of operations

At December31, 2002, SOFTBANK, including its consolidated affiliates SOFTBANK, held approximately 4% of the then outstanding Common Stock of the Company. In
addition, the Company has joint ventures with SOFTBANK in France, Germany, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. A Managing Partner of a SOFTBANK affiliate is also a member of the Company Board of
Directors. 
During
2002, 2001, and 2000, the Company recognized net revenues of approximately $104million, $93million, and $68million, respectively, on advertising and other
arrangements with SOFTBANK. Management believes that prices on these contracts were comparable to those with other similarly situated customers of the Company. 
The
Company and other third parties are limited partners in Softbank Capital Partners LP Softbank Capital, for which a Softbank affiliate is the General Partner. The Company initially committed to
a total investment of $30million, and subsequently committed to invest an additional $6million. To date, the total investment by the Company in Softbank Capital is
$342million. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Company invested on the same terms and on the same basis as all other limited partners. See
Note8 Joint Ventures for further information related to transactions involving SOFTBANK. 
Note8 JOINT VENTURES 
Yahoo! Japan.During April1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK, which was 
55  amended in September 1997, whereby Yahoo Japan Corporation Yahoo! Japan was formed to establish and manage in Japan a Japanese version of the Yahoo! Internet Guide, develop related Japanese
online navigational services, and conduct other related business. The investment in Yahoo! Japan is being accounted for using the equity method. As of December31, 2002, the carrying value of
the investment was $1033million and is recorded in other assets. The fair value of the Company 34% ownership in Yahoo! Japan, based on the quoted trading price, was approximately
$20billion as of December31, 2002. 
During
2001 and 2000, Yahoo! Japan acquired the Company equity interests in certain entities in Japan for total consideration of $89million and $563million, respectively. The 2001
acquisition was paid in cash and the 2000 acquisition was paid in shares of Yahoo! Japan Common Stock. As a result of the 2000 acquisition, the Company increased its investment in Yahoo! Japan, which
resulted in approximately $408million of goodwill to be amortized over seven years. This amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS142. During the years ended December31,
2001 and 2000, the Company recorded gains in other income of approximately $52million and $408million, respectively, from these transactions. 
The
Company records its share of the results of Yahoo! Japan one quarter in arrears within other income loss, net. The following table presents Yahoo! Japan condensed financial information, as
derived from the Yahoo! Japan financial statements for the twelve months ended September30, 2002 and 2001 in thousands: Years ended September 30 2002

Company financial statements. 
Yahoo! Europe.On November1, 1996, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with a subsidiary of SOFTBANK whereby separate
companies were formed in Germany, the United Kingdom, and France collectively Yahoo! Europe to establish and manage versions of the Yahoo! Internet Guide for those countries, develop related
online navigational services, and conduct other related business. The parties have invested a total of $60million in proportion to their respective equity interests as of December31,
2002. The Company has a majority share of approximately 70% in each of the Yahoo! Europe entities, and therefore, has consolidated their financial results. 
Yahoo! Korea.During August1997, the Company signed a joint venture agreement with SOFTBANK and other SOFTBANK affiliated companies
whereby Yahoo! Korea was formed to develop and operate a Korean version of the Yahoo! Internet Guide, develop related Korean online navigational services, and conduct other related business. The
parties originally invested a total of $10million in proportion to their respective equity interests. During March2000, the Company invested an additional $610million in
Yahoo! Korea. As a result, the Company
recorded goodwill of $202million, to be amortized over seven years. This amortization ceased upon the adoption of SFAS142. The Company has a majority share of approximately 67% in the
joint venture, and therefore, has consolidated its financial results. 
Note9 RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
During 2001, the Company announced restructuring programs to balance its investment in growth areas with the desire to modify its near-term business plan to reflect
an economic and capital market slowdown. These restructuring programs included worldwide workforce reductions, consolidation of excess facilities and other charges. As a result of these restructuring
programs, the Company recorded restructuring costs of $575million classified as operating expenses in 2001. 
56  
Worldwide Workforce Reduction.The restructuring programs resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 660 employees across certain
business functions, operating units, and geographic regions. The worldwide workforce reductions were substantially completed within 2001. The Company recorded a workforce reduction charge of
$151million in 2001 relating primarily to severance and fringe benefits. 
Consolidation of Excess Facilities and Other Charges.The Company recorded a restructuring charge of $423million in 2001 relating
to the consolidation of excess facilities and other charges. Of this charge, approximately $311million was primarily for excess facilities relating to lease terminations and
non-cancelable lease costs. This estimate is based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets. If facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or if
it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities, the maximum amount the actual loss could exceed the original estimate is approximately $53million. Property and equipment that was
disposed of or removed from operations resulted in a net charge of $94million and consisted primarily of furniture and fixtures, servers, leasehold improvements, and computer equipment. The
Company also recorded other restructuring costs of $18million relating primarily to payments for professional fees incurred with the restructuring program.

the consolidation of facilities will be paid over the respective lease terms through December2012. 
Note10 STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY 
Stockholder Rights Plan.In March2001, the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan. Under the plan, Rights were distributed as a
dividend at the rate of one Right for each share of Common Stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on March20, 2001. The Rights Plan was not adopted in response to any
effort to acquire control of the Company. The Rights will expire on March1, 2011. 
Stock Repurchase Program.In March2001, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the Company to repurchase
up to $500million of its outstanding shares of Common Stock from time to time over the next two years, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. As of December31,
2002, the Company had repurchased 16,458,620 shares of Common Stock at an average of $972 per share for a total amount of approximately $1600million. Of the shares repurchased, 16,033,620
shares were purchased from SOFTBANK at an average of $967 per share. Treasury stock is accounted for under the cost method. 
See
Note14 Subsequent Events for information related to the extension of the Stock Repurchase Program. 
Stock Option Plans.The Company 1995 Stock Option Plan and stock option plans assumed through acquisitions are collectively referred to as
the Plans. 
The
Plans allow for the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, and stock purchase rights. Options are generally granted for a term of ten years and generally
vest over a four-year period. The 1995 Stock Option Plan was amended in April2002 to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan by an aggregate of
35million shares to 287million shares. Shares available for future option grants at December31, 2002 totaled approximately 385million. 
57  The
1996 Directors' Stock Option Plan the Directors' Plan provides for the issuance of up to 44million non-statutory stock options to non-employee directors of the
Company. Options under the Directors' Plan vest in equal monthly installments over four years for initial grants to new directors, and over four years for annual grants, with 25% of such options
vesting on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, with the remaining options vesting in equal monthly installments over the 36-month period thereafter. The Directors'
Plan was amended in April2002 to increase the annual grant for outside Directors from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares and to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the plan
by an aggregate of 2million shares to 44million shares. Shares available for future option grants at December31, 2002 under the Directors' Plan totaled approximately
32million shares.

67,055 4559 Options to purchase approximately 627million shares and 500million shares were exercisable as of December31, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. The weighted average exercise prices per share for options exercisable as of December31, 2001, and 2000 were $3873 and $2325, respectively. 
The
Company recorded compensation expense in the amount of $84million, $91million, and $209million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. As of December31, 2002,
approximately $23million remains to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods of the options. Employee Stock Purchase Plan.The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan, which provides for the issuance of a
maximum of 76million shares of Common Stock. In February2001, the Company 
58  amended the Purchase Plan to allow, among other things, a 24-month offering period beginning with the July1, 2001 offering period. Eligible employees can have up to 15% of their
earnings withheld, up to certain maximums, to be used to purchase shares of the Company Common Stock at certain plan-defined dates. The price of the Common Stock purchased under the
Purchase Plan for offering periods prior to July1, 2001 was equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the commencement date of each six-month
offering period or the specified purchase date. The price of the Common Stock purchased under the Purchase Plan for offering periods on or subsequent to July1, 2001 will be equal to 85% of the
lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the commencement date of each 24-month offering period or the specified purchase date. During 2002, 1,228,000 shares were purchased at
prices from $925 to $1255 per share. During 2001, 645,000 shares were purchased at prices from $925 to $1699 per share. During 2000, 199,000 shares were purchased at prices from $2561 to $10530
per share. As of December31, 2002, 41million shares were available under the Purchase Plan for future issuance. 
Stock Based Compensation.The Company measures compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. If the fair value based method had been applied in measuring stock compensation expense, the pro forma effect on net income loss and net income loss per share would have been as
follows in thousands, except per share amounts: Years Ended December 31 2002

268million and 600million shares, respectively, as their effect is anti-dilutive. 
The
weighted average fair value of options where the exercise price equaled the market price on grant date was $999, $1036, and $6982 for grants in the years ended
December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options where the exercise price was greater than the market price on grant date was $1062, $987, and $3774
for grants in the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The weighted average exercise price of options where the exercise price was greater than the market price on grant
date was $1712, $4648, and $9584 for grants in the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
Because
additional stock options are expected to be granted each year, the pro forma disclosures are not representative of pro forma effects on reported financial results for future years. The fair
value of option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: Years Ended December 31 2002

3 The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in the opinion of management, the existing
models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its options.

Note11 SEGMENTS 
The Company manages its business geographically. The Company primary areas of measurement and decision-making are the United States and International. The Company
management relies on an internal management reporting process that provides revenue and segment EBITDA information for making financial decisions and allocating resources. Segment EBITDA information
includes income loss from operations before certain unallocated operating costs and expenses, including stock compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and depreciation. Management believes
that segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure of evaluating the operating performance of the Company segments. However, segment EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or
superior to, operating income, cash flows or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Revenue
is attributed to individual countries according to the international online property that generated the revenue. No single foreign country accounted for more than 10% of net revenues in 2002,
2001, and 2000. Property and equipment information is based on the physical location of the assets.

and $19billion, respectively. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010, and approximately $200million of the state net operating loss
carryforwards will begin to expire in 2003. The Company federal and state research tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes are approximately $88million and $83million,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2010. Approximately $322million of net operating loss carryforwards relate to acquired entities and
expire beginning in 2010. The Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $16billion as of December31, 2002 for deferred tax assets because of uncertainty regarding their
realization. 
Deferred
tax assets of approximately $14billion as of December31, 2002 pertain to certain net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of
employee stock options. When recognized, the tax benefit of these loss and credit carryforwards are accounted for as a credit to additional paid-in capital rather than a reduction of the
income tax provision. Deferred tax assets include approximately $30million related to net operating loss carryforwards in various foreign jurisdictions. These carryforwards will expire if not
utilized. 
Deferred
tax assets of $545million and $238million, respectively, are included in prepaid and other current assets as of December31, 2002 and 2001. Deferred tax liabilities
of $545million and $238million, respectively, are included in other liabilities as of December31, 2002 and 2001. 
Note13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Operating Leases.During 1999, the Company entered into agreements for the development of an office complex in Sunnyvale, California to
serve as our headquarters. Upon substantial completion of the construction in 2001, approximately $259million was funded for the complex in connection with the lease financing arrangement, and
at December31, 2001 such amount had been classified as restricted long-term investments. During July2002, the Company exercised its right, pursuant to the master lease
agreement to acquire the complex for approximately $259million, which was funded by the restricted long-term investments. 
The
Company has entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for other offices throughout the U.S., and for international subsidiaries, for original lease periods ranging
from 6months to 13years and expiring between 2003 and 2012. 
In
addition, the Company has entered into various sublease arrangements associated with excess facilities under the 2001 restructuring programs. Such subleases have terms extending through 2006 and
amounts estimated to be received have been included in determining the restructuring accrual. 
62  Net
lease commitments as of December31, 2002 can be summarized as follows in millions: Years ending December 31,

to be ready for occupancy in the third quarter of 2003. Upon completion of the building construction, the Company is committed to a 15year lease obligation, with annual lease payments under
the lease of approximately $51million in year one, approximately $67million in year two, and with increases of 35% in each of the following years. These amounts are included in the
table above. After year one of the lease, the Company has the right to ipurchase the buildings for approximately $689million, plus fees, iirestructure the lease
arrangement, or iiicontinue leasing the buildings under the original agreement for the remaining fourteen years. 
Rent
expense under operating leases totaled $147million, $193million and $246million for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. 
Investments in Privately-Held Companies.During 2002, the Company acquired an equity interest of approximately 16% in Sonera zed
OY, Zed, a Finnish company and a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of a privately-held mobile device services company. Under the terms of the investment agreement, the Company has
call options to acquire the remaining interests not owned by the Company or sell back its shares. In addition, Zed has a put option enabling Zed to require the Company to acquire the remaining
interests not owned by the Company if the Company exercises its option to buy a majority of Zed outstanding shares. The amount of the purchase price for the remaining equity interests in Zed not
held by the Company is not determinable at this time but will be based on an operating performance based valuation of Zed. The Company is not obligated to purchase additional equity in Zed unless it
chooses to exercise the option described above. As part of the transaction, the Company has agreed to provide up to 48million Euro in additional funding to Zed. Other than this amount, the
Company is not obligated to guarantee any obligations of Zed or provide any funding to Zed. The Company investment in Zed was immaterial to its consolidated balance sheet as of December31,
2002. 
Other Commitments.In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into various arrangements with vendors and other business
partners, principally for marketing,
bandwidth and content arrangements. There are no material commitments for these arrangements extending beyond 2003. 
See
also Note14 Subsequent Events regarding the Company acquisition of Inktomi Corporation. 
Contingencies.From time to time, third parties assert patent infringement claims against Yahoo! in the form of letters, lawsuits, and other
forms of communication. Currently, the Company or its acquired subsidiaries, are engaged in several lawsuits regarding patent issues and have been notified of a number of other potential patent
disputes. 
In
addition, from time to time the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks, copyrights and
other intellectual property rights, and a variety of claims arising in connection with its email, message boards, auction sites, shopping services, and other communications and community features,
such as claims alleging defamation or invasion of privacy. 
The
Company does not believe, based on current knowledge, that any of the foregoing legal proceedings or claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. However, the Company may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims. In the event of a determination adverse to Yahoo!, the Company may incur
substantial monetary liability, and be required to change its business practices. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. 
On
May24, 2001, Arista Records,Inc., Bad Boy Records, BMG Music d/b/a The RCA Records Label, Capitol Records,Inc., Virgin Records America,Inc., Sony Music
EntertainmentInc., UMG Recordings,Inc., Interscope Records, Motown Record Company, L.P., and Zomba 
63  Recording Corporation filed a lawsuit alleging copyright infringement against LAUNCH Media,Inc. LAUNCH in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. After the
lawsuit was commenced, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire LAUNCH. In June2001, LAUNCH announced that it had settled the LAUNCH litigation as to UMG Recordings,Inc. The
Company acquisition of LAUNCH closed in August2001, and since that time LAUNCH has been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the
consumer-influenced portion of LAUNCH LAUNCHcast service as operated at the time of the complaint was interactive within the meaning of Section114 of the Copyright Act and therefore does
not qualify for the compulsory license provided for by the Copyright Act. The Complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and damages for the alleged infringement. The Company and LAUNCH do not
believe that LAUNCH has infringed any rights of plaintiffs and intend to vigorously contest the lawsuit. The lawsuit is still in the preliminary, discovery phase and the Company does not believe it is
feasible to predict or determine the outcome or resolution of the LAUNCH litigation. The range of possible resolutions of the LAUNCH litigation could include judgments against the Company or
settlements that could require substantial payments by the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In
January2003, LAUNCH announced that it had settled the LAUNCH litigation as to Sony Music Entertainment,Inc. 
Note14 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
Stock Repurchase Program.In March2003, the Company Board of Directors authorized a two year extension of the stock repurchase
program, which extension authorizes the Company to repurchase up to approximately $340million representing the balance of the $500million originally authorized in March2001
of our outstanding shares of Common Stock from time to time over the next two
years, depending on market conditions, share price and other factors. The Company may utilize equity instrument contracts to facilitate the repurchase of Common Stock. 
Acquisition.In March2003, the Company completed the acquisition of Inktomi Corporation Inktomi, a provider of original
equipment manufacturer OEM Web search and paid inclusion services. The total estimated purchase price of approximately $2795million consisted of $2698million in cash
consideration, approximately $64million of stock options exchanged and direct transaction costs of approximately $33million. The
preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of Inktomi is as follows in thousands: Tangible assets acquired 91,807 Amortizable intangible assets 52,300 Goodwill 199,466 Total assets acquired 343,573 Liabilities assumed 65,563 Deferred compensation 1,500 Total 279,510 A preliminary estimate of $523million has been allocated to amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer contracts and developed technology
with useful lives not exceeding five years. 
A
preliminary estimate of $1995million has been allocated to goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets
acquired. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 142, Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment, at least
annually. The preliminary purchase price allocation for Inktomi is subject to revision as more detailed analysis is completed and additional information on the fair values of the assets and
liabilities becomes available. Any change in the fair value of the net assets of Inktomi will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill.
