We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Authentic
Specialty Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the two years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Authentic Specialty
Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results

NATURE OF BUSINESS: Authentic Specialty Foods, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company is engaged in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of a wide
variety of Mexican food products primarily to grocery stores, independent retail
and wholesale food outlets, and individual retailers located primarily in the
western United States and Texas.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, LV Foods, L.L.C., La
Victoria Foods, Inc., La Monita Mexican Food Products, Inc. and Sauces
Unlimited, Inc. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and their reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of the product
to customers or distributors.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company
considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with original maturities
of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, exceed
federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: The fair value of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates the carrying
amount because of the short maturity of those investments. The fair value of the
short- and long-term debt is estimated based on interest rates for the same or
similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar remaining
maturities and collateral requirements and approximates the fair value.
INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on the first-in, first-out FIFO method.                    F-8

Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization are provided using
the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of individual
assets over the following periods                                         YEARS 
Fixtures and equipment                             3-10

Goodwill                                    25-40
Trademarks and tradenames                            40 The Company reviews its long-lived assets, trademarks, and goodwill related to
those assets periodically to determine potential impairment by comparing the
carrying value of the long-lived assets, trademarks, and identified goodwill
with the estimated future net undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
the use of the assets, including cash flows from disposition. Should the sum of
the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value, the Company
would recognize an impairment loss at that date. An impairment loss would be
measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair
value estimated discounted future cash flows of the long-lived assets and
identified goodwill.
Goodwill not identified with impaired assets will continue to be evaluated to
determine whether events or circumstances warrant a write-down or revised
estimates of useful lives. The Company will determine a potential impairment by
comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the estimated future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets, including
cash flows from disposition. Should the sum of the expected future net cash
flows be less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment
loss at that date. An impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount
by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value estimated discounted future
cash flows of the goodwill.
To date, management has determined that no impairment of long-lived assets and
goodwill exists.                    F-9

INCOME TAXES: Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred
tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable
temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management,
it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the
effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.
MARKET DEVELOPMENT FUND ALLOWANCE: The Company provides credits to certain
customers related to specific marketing programs upon proof of the participation
by the customer. All credits offered to customers are recorded at the time of
performance as a credit against amounts due from the customers.
EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE: The FASB has issued Statement No. 128, Earnings Per
Share, which supersedes APB Opinion No. 15. Statement No. 128 requires the
presentation of earnings per share by all entities that have common stock or
potential common stock, such as options, warrants, and convertible securities,
outstanding that trade in a public market. Basic per share amounts are computed,
generally, by dividing net income or loss by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted per share amounts assume the conversion,
exercise, or issuance of all potential common stock instruments, unless the
effect is antidilutive, thereby reducing the loss or increasing the income per
common share.
The Company initially applied Statement No. 128 for the year ended December 31,
1997 and, as required by the statement, has restated all per share information
for the prior years to conform to the statement.
During 1997, the Company granted options and warrants to employees and
consultants to purchase a total of 450,000 shares of common stock at a
weighted-average exercise price of $864. Those options and warrants were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the Company
incurred a loss in 1997 and their inclusion in the calculation of diluted loss
per share would have an antidilutive effect. There were no common stock
equivalents outstanding during the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995.
Therefore, basic and diluted earnings loss per share amounts are the same in
each period presented.                    F-10

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS
LA VICTORIA FOODS, INC. ACQUISITION: On September 2, 1997, pursuant to a
contribution and exchange agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of
the beneficial ownership of 100 percent of the capital stock of La Victoria
Foods, Inc. La Victoria. La Victoria is engaged in the manufacture,
distribution, and sale of a variety of salsas and other Mexican sauces. La
Victoria had been owned by the Tanklage family since 1947.
In April 1997, LV Foods, L.L.C. LV Foods acquired a 50 percent interest in
the outstanding shares of La Victoria in exchange for $5 million in cash and a
$7 million note payable to the seller of the shares. LV Foods was owned 99
percent by TSG2 L.P. and TSG2 Management, L.L.C. and 1 percent by the former
chairman of the Company. TSG2 L.P. and TSG2 Management, L.L.C. are affiliates of
The Shansby Group Shansby. Shansby, which is a related party, owned
substantially all of the Company prior to September 1997 see Note 9.
On September 2, 1997, the Company acquired the 50 percent beneficial interest in
La Victoria held by Mr. Robert C. Tanklage. Mr. Tanklage received a total of
$17,600,000 for his 50 percent interest comprised of $12,000,000 in cash and
875,000 shares of common stock with a fair value of $5,600,000. The Company
employed Mr. Tanklage as president of La Victoria and assumed the obligation
under a five-year employment contract between Mr. Tanklage and La Victoria dated
May 31, 1997. On December 17, 1997, the Company terminated the employment
contract of Mr. Tanklage as part of a succession plan for La Victoria. Pursuant
to the terms of the contract, the Company paid Mr. Tanklage approximately
$2,915,000.
Concurrent with the acquisition of Mr. Tanklage shares, 100 percent of the
ownership of LV Foods was transferred to the Company and LV Foods became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
Because the Company and LV Foods were both controlled by Shansby, the
acquisition of LV Foods by the Company is a transaction between entities under
common control, and accordingly, the net assets and liabilities transferred in
the transaction were accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to
that in pooling of interests accounting. Accordingly, the purchase price of LV
Foods is based on LV Foods' historical cost investment in La Victoria, its only
asset. This amount is based on LV Foods' original investment in La Victoria of
$12 million in April 1997, adjusted for net equity method adjustments.                    F-11

$ 15,099
The present value of the payments required under the capital leases with the
Tanklage estate exceeded the fair value of the related real estate. Accordingly,
the excess of the payments over the fair value of the real estate represents
additional purchase price and has been recorded as a deferred purchase price
liability see Note 4.
ACQUISITION OF LA MONITA MEXICAN FOOD PRODUCTS, INC.: On September 30, 1997, the
Company acquired the net assets of La Monita Mexican Food Products, Inc. La
Monita, a manufacturer and distributor of Mexican food products located in
Victoria, Texas, for approximately $29 million in cash, $950,000 of which was
paid directly to the former owner with the remainder used to retire certain
debt, plus transaction expenses of approximately $292,000. The acquisition has

ACQUISITION OF SAUCES UNLIMITED, INC.: On October 30, 1997, the Company executed
a stock purchase agreement with Sauces Unlimited, Inc., a manufacturer of salsas
and other Mexican food sauces located in San Antonio, Texas. The $30 million
purchase price included a $24 million payment to two former stockholders 300,000 to retire a term loan and revolving credit facility, and transaction
expenses of approximately $286,000. In addition, the former owners received
warrants to acquire a total of 40,000 shares of the Company common stock at an
exercise price of $11125 per share. The five-year warrant is exercisable
immediately. The estimated fair value of these warrants of approximately $79,000
was included as a transaction cost.
The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price has
been allocated approximately as follows: property and equipment of $770,000,
current assets of $1,570,000, other assets of $100,000, current liabilities of
$847,000, and long-term debt of $200,000. The cost in excess of the fair value
of the net assets acquired of approximately $1,673,000 has been allocated to
goodwill and is being amortized over an estimated life of 25 years.

acquisitions, the Company believes it is now more likely than not that those
assets will be realized. A portion of the deferred tax assets previously
reserved for, principally net operating losses, were generated before the
Company quasi-reorganization and have been recorded as a direct addition to
additional paid-in capital see Note 7.
At December 31, 1997, the Company had net operating losses of approximately
$4,303,000 expiring as follows Expiration date:
2008                          $     3,059,000

approximately $760,000.                    F-20

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 7. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
Preferred stock: Under the Company Restated Articles of Incorporation, the
Board of Directors of the Company is authorized to issue, from time to time,
without any action on the part of the Company shareholders, up to 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock in one or more series, with such relative rights,
powers, preferences, limitations, and restrictions as are determined by the
Board of Directors at the time of issuance. Accordingly, the Board of Directors
is empowered to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion,
voting, or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other
rights of the holders of common stock. In the event of such issuance, the
preferred stock could be utilized, under either circumstance, as a method of
discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control of the Company.
QUASI-REORGANIZATION: The Board of Directors approved a corporate readjustment
of the accounts as of December 31, 1993, effected in accordance with accounting
principles applicable to quasi-reorganizations. At December 31, 1993, the
Company assets and liabilities approximated fair value, and accordingly, there
was no write-down of the assets and liabilities of the Company in conjunction
with the quasi-reorganization. The quasi-reorganization was accomplished by
offsetting the accumulated deficit in retained earnings of $4,125,298 against
additional paid-in capital.
RECAPITALIZATION: In June 1997, the Company affected a 1,700-to-1 common stock
split and increased its authorized shares of common stock to 20,000,000. The
effect of this common stock split has been retroactively reflected in these
financial statements and notes for all periods presented.
INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING: In September 1997, the Company completed a public
offering of shares of its common stock. The offering generated total net
proceeds of $34,224,000, less direct offering costs of approximately $1,500,000.
In connection with the offering, the Company repurchased 788,500 shares of
common stock owned by Shansby and TSG International for approximately $59
million. The price for this repurchase was based upon the net offering price
after underwriters' discounts and commissions in the public offering.
Stock options and warrants: In June 1997, the Board of Directors and the
shareholders of the Company approved its 1997 Stock Plan the Stock Plan. The
purpose of the 1997 Stock Plan is to provide directors, employees, and
consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries additional incentive and reward
opportunities designed to enhance the profitable growth of the Company. The
Stock Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options intended to
qualify under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The
Stock Plan also provides for the issuance of options that do not constitute
incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock awards. The options may be
granted at an exercise price of not less than the fair market value of common
stock at the date of grant 110 percent for more than 10 percent shareholders.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the stock option plan.
Had compensation cost for the Company stock option plan been determined based
on the fair value at the grant date for awards in 1997 consistent with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss and net loss per share would
have been increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below                                      
Net loss, as reported                    $      563,000
Net loss, pro forma                           653,000
Basic and diluted net loss per share, as reported             015
Basic and diluted net loss per share, pro forma              018 The above pro forma effects on net loss and net loss per share are not likely to
be representative of the effects on reported net income loss for future years
because options vest over several years and additional awards generally are made
each year.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1997                               
Expected dividend yield                     Expected stock price volatility                 15%
Risk-free interest rate                    630%
Expected life of options years                 3 The weighted-average fair value, as determined using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model, of options and warrants granted during 1997 was $178.                   F-22

NOTE 10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
LITIGATION: The Company is party to litigation relating to property damage and
liability claims as well as certain employment-related matters arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome of the
matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the
Company.
EPA MATTERS: By letter dated April 13, 1995, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency EPA has identified one of the Company subsidiaries, La Victoria, as
a potentially responsible party PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended CERCLA, for
the cleanup of contamination from hazardous substances at the South El Monte
Operable Unit of the San Gabriel Valley Superfund Site. Under CERCLA, persons
may be subject to joint and several liability for cleanup costs.
The Company has completed a subsurface soil remediation of solvents at its
Rosemead facility, which is located within the San Gabriel Valley. The EPA has
identified approximately 50 PRPs at the site. The EPA has requested that La
Victoria participate in the groundwater sampling program for a remedial
investigation and feasibility study. Based on the limited impact to groundwater
that appears to be related to La Victoria Rosemead facility, La Victoria
declined to participate in the groundwater monitoring. Since that time, La
Victoria has received no further correspondence from the EPA. The Company does
not believe that its ultimate liabilities in relation to the site will have a
material effect on its financial position; however, it is not possible to
determine the ultimate environmental liabilities, if any, that may arise from
this matter.                    F-25
