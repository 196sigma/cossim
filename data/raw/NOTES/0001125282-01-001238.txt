Notes to Consolidated Financial     75                    47 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Shareholders of eMagin Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of eMagin
Corporation a Nevada corporation in the development stage; see Note 1 and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the year then ended and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholder equity and cash
flows for the period from inception January 23, 1996 to December 31, 2000.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. We did not audit the financial statements of eMagin Corporation
for the period from inception to December 31, 1999. Such statements are included
in the cumulative from inception to December 31, 2000 totals of the statements
of operations, shareholder equity and cash flows and reflect a total net loss
of less than a percent of the related cumulative totals. Those statements were
audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us and our
opinion, insofar as it relates to amounts from the period from inception to
December 31, 1999, included in the cumulative totals, is based solely upon the
reports of the other auditors.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of eMagin Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then
ended, and for the period from inception to December 31, 2000, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company recurring losses from
operations since inception raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue
as a going concern. Management plans concerning these matters are also
described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. New York, New York                Arthur Andersen LLP

Board of Directors
FASHION DYNAMICS CORP. I have audited the accompanying Balance Sheets of FASHION DYNAMICS CORP. A
Development Stage Company, as of December 31, 1999 and the related statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December
31, 1999 and 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on my audit.
I conducted my audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion.
In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of FASHION DYNAMICS CORP. A
Development Stage Company, as of December 31, 1999 and the results of its
operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31,
1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company
will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial
statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has no
established source of revenue. This raises substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management plan in regard to these matters is
described in Note 1. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. s/ Barry L. Friedman

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - NATURE OF BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE RISKS
Fashion Dynamics Corporation FDC was organized January 23, 1996, under the
laws of the State of Nevada. FDC had no active business operations other than to
acquire an interest in a business. On March 16, 2000, FDC acquired FED
Corporation the Merger. FED was a developer and manufacturer of optical
systems and micro displays for use in the electronics industry. FED wholly
owned subsidiary, Virtual Vision, develops and markets micro display systems and
optics technology for commercial, industrial and military applications. The
merged company changed its name to eMagin Corporation the Company or eMagin
Note 2. Following the Merger, the business conducted by the Company is the
business conducted by FED prior to the Merger. The Company continues to be a development stage company, as defined by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 7, Accounting and Reporting by
Development Stage Enterprises, as it continues to devote substantially all of
its efforts to establishing a new business, and it has not yet commenced its
planned principal operations. Revenues earned by the Company to date are
primarily related to research and development type contracts and are not related
to the Company planned principal operations of commercialization of products
using organic light emitting diode OLED technology. Since its inception, FED Corporation entered into research and development
cost-sharing arrangements, as well as research and development contracts, with
several government agencies and private industry. To date, such arrangements
have provided total funding of approximately $366 million, including $326
million by FED prior to the Merger, through cost sharing and contract revenues.
Certain of these arrangements continue through 2001 and may provide for
approximately $93 million of additional funding. Such funding is subject to,
among other factors, satisfactory progress on projects and available government
funding.
Through December 31, 2000, the Company had incurred development stage losses
totaling approximately $482 million. Prior to the acquisition of FED by FDC,
FED incurred developmental stage losses totaling approximately $525 million. At
December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $82 million of cash, cash
equivalents and contract receivables to fund short-term working capital
requirements. At February 28, 2001, such amounts totaled approximately $46
million. The Company ability to continue as a going concern and its future
success is dependent upon its ability to raise capital in the near future to
continue: 1 its research and development efforts, 2 hiring and retaining key
employees, 3 satisfaction of its commitments and 4 the successful
development and marketing of its products.
The Company believes that it will be able to secure financing in the near term
and that the proceeds from such financings, along with its remaining cash
resources at December 31, 2000, will be sufficient to fund the Company
operations into the first quarter of 2002 and beyond. However, there can be no
assurance that sufficient capital will be available, when required, to permit
the Company to realize its plan, or even if such capital is available, that it
will be at terms favorable to the Company. Additionally, there can be no
assurance that the Company efforts to produce a commercially viable product
will be successful, or that the Company will generate sufficient revenues to
provide positive cash flows from operations.
55 These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company ability to
continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might result should the Company be unable to
continue in existence. Note 2 - FED ACQUISITION
On March 16, 2000 FDC acquired all of the outstanding stock of FED. Under the
terms of the agreement, FDC issued approximately 105 million shares of its
common stock to FED shareholders, and issued approximately 39 million options
and warrants in exchange for existing FED options and warrants. The total
purchase price of the transaction was approximately $985 million, including
$734 million of value relating to the shares issued at a fair value of $7 per
share, the value of the simultaneous private placement transaction of similar
securities, $209 million of value relating to the options and warrants
exchanged, based on the difference between the fair value and the exercise price
of said equity instruments and $38 million of assumed liabilities. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: $13 million to deferred
compensation for the portion of value of options and warrants exchanged relating
to unvested securities, $180 million to identifiable intangible assets as
valued by an independent appraisal, and $546 million to goodwill. Such goodwill
is being amortized over a three year period. The Company recorded approximately
$209 million in amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets for
the year ended December 31, 2000. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as
clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4, amounts
assigned to in-process research and development will be charged to expense as
part of the allocation of purchase price. Accordingly, the Company recognized a
charge of approximately $128 million associated with the write-off of acquired
in-process research and technology, which is included in the accompanying
statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The following information reflects pro forma statements of operations data for
the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, assuming the acquisition of FED

Note 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue and Cost Recognition
The Company has historically earned revenues from certain of its research and
development activities under both firm fixed-price contracts and cost-type
contracts, including some cost-plus-fee contract,. Revenues relating to firm
fixed-price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage-of-completion
56 method of accounting as costs are incurred cost-to-cost basis. Revenues on
cost-plus-fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees
or profits based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and an allocation of
allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract, as periodically adjusted
to reflect revised agreed upon rates.
As of December 31, 2000, the Company had received advance payments on contracts
to be completed of $311,812. Through December 31, 2000, the Company has
recognized revenues of approximately $450,000 under this agreement in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements. Costs and Estimated Profits in Excess of Billings on Contracts in Progress
The Company records costs and estimated profits in excess of billings on
contracts in progress as an asset on its balance sheet to the extent such costs,
and related profits, if any, have been incurred under outstanding contracts and
are expected to be collected.
The components of costs and estimated profits in excess of billings on contracts
in progress as of December 31, 2000 were as follows                                  2000
Total costs incurred and estimated profits   $   3,408,000
Less amounts billed                  2,781,000
Costs and estimated profits in excess of
billings on contracts in progress        $    627,000
Research and Development/Cost Sharing Arrangements
To date, activities of the Company include the performance of research and
development under cooperative agreements with United States Government agencies.
Current industry practices provide that costs and related funding under such
agreements be accounted for as incurred and earned.
The Company has entered into three cost sharing arrangements with an agency of
the U.S. Government and two commercial customers. The Company has incurred
research and development costs and earned funding under these agreements as of
December 31, 2000 as follows                                   2000
Unfunded research and development     $  8,053,000
Research and development costs         2,909,000
Funding received                1,328,000
$  9,634,000
The Company may incur approximately $3,396,000 of additional costs on these
efforts. If such costs, as defined, are incurred, the government is obligated to
reimburse the Company $1,439,000 of such amounts.                    57 Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily
of overnight commercial paper and are stated at cost, which approximates market,
and are considered available for sale.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, requires the classification of debt and equity securities based on
whether the securities will be held to maturity, are considered trading
securities or are available-for-sale. Classification within these categories may
require the securities to be reported at their fair market value with unrealized
gains and losses included either in current earnings or reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, depending on the ultimate classification.
Comprehensive Income
The Company complies with the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which requires companies to report all changes in equity
during a period, except those resulting from investment by owners and
distributions to owners, for the period in which they are recognized.
Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes
in equity or other comprehensive income such as unrealized gains or losses on
securities classified as available-for-sale, foreign currency translation
adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustments. Comprehensive income must
be reported on the face of the annual financial statements. The Company
operations did not give rise to any material items includable in comprehensive
income, which were not already in net income for the years ended December 31,
2000, 1999 and 1998. Accordingly, the Company comprehensive income is the same
as its net income or loss for all periods presented.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation on
equipment is calculated using the straight-line method of depreciation over
their estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
calculated by using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or lease terms. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Identifiable intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of FED and the
excess purchase price over net assets acquired goodwill are being amortized
on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives of
approximately three years. As of December 31, 2000, goodwill and other
intangible assets were comprised of the following in millions        Goodwill                         $546
Purchased identifiable intangibles            180
Less: Accumulated amortization              209
Goodwill and other intangible assets, net        $517
The Company recorded approximately $209 million in amortization expense related
to purchased intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2000.                    58 Long-Lived Assets
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed, establishes financial accounting and
reporting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain
identifiable intangibles and goodwill. SFAS No. 121 requires, among other
things, that assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be
realizable considering, among other factors, expected future undiscounted
operating cash flows of the related asset.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recorded by applying enacted statutory tax rates to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the
Company has net deferred tax assets of approximately $198 million and $143
million respectively, primarily resulting from the future tax benefit of net
operating loss carry forwards discussed below. Such net deferred tax assets are
fully offset by valuation allowances because of the uncertainty as to their
future to be realized.
At December 31, 2000, the Company has net operating loss carry forwards totaling
approximately $497 million, inclusive of the net operating losses acquired as a
result of the acquisition of FED, which expire through 2020, available to offset
future federal taxable income. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue
Code, the usage of a portion of these net operating loss carry forwards is
limited due to changes in ownership that have occurred.
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of eMagin Corporation include
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned
subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control. Inter-company
transactions and balances are eliminated.
Loss per Common Share
In accordance with SFAS No 128, net loss per common share amounts basic EPS
were computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding and excluding any potential dilution. Net loss per common
share assuming dilution diluted EPS were computed by reflecting potential
dilution from the exercise of stock options and warrants. Common equivalent
shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted EPS as their effect is
antidilutive.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to employees in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company, as permitted, elected not to adopt
the financial reporting requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, for stock-based compensation granted to employees.
Accordingly, the Company has disclosed in the notes to the financial statements
the pro forma net loss for the periods presented as if the fair-value-based
method was used in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123.                    59 Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year
presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS
No138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instrument and Certain Hedging
Activities, which amends the accounting and reporting standards of SFAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities. The Statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for
hedging activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for all fiscal quarters beginning
after June 15, 2000 as amended by SFAS No. 137 and will not require
retroactive restatement of prior-period financial statements. Management
believes the adoption of SFAS 133 will not have a material impact on the
Company.
In March 2000, the FASB issued interpretation FIN No. 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation-An Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25. Among other things, FIN 44 clarifies the definition of
employees, the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a
non-compensatory plan, the accounting consequences of various modifications to
the terms of a previously fixed stock option or award and the accounting for an
exchange of stock compensation awards in a business combination. FIN 44 is
effective July 1, 2000, but certain of its conclusions cover specific events
that occurred after either December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000. The Company
adopted the provisions of FIN 44 as of July 1, 2000.

for the period December 31, 2000 was approximately $580,000. For the year ended
December 31, 1999 these amounts were not material.                    60 Additionally, from time to time, the Company makes deposits on certain equipment
that may ultimately be purchased by a financing company and leased to the
Company. Amounts paid by the Company for such deposits totaled approximately
$403,000 at December 31, 2000.
Note 5 - BRIDGE LOANS
In September 1999, FED entered into two $1,000,000 convertible bridge loans for
an aggregate of $2,000,000. Each loan bore interest at 8% and matured in June
2000. The loans were convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the
Company common stock at a purchase price equal to the per share value of the
private placement completed in connection with the Merger. These liabilities
were assumed by the Company in the Merger. The entire outstanding balance of the
bridge loans, including accrued and unpaid interest was repaid in June 2000.
Note 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT

61 Note 7 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The authorized common stock of the Company consists of 40,000,000 shares with a
par value of $0001 per share.
On March 30, 1998 the Company forward split its common stock 6:1 increasing the
number of issued and outstanding common shares from 1,100,000 to 6,600,000.
On December 31, 1999 the Company forward split its common stock 3054:1,
increasing the number of issued and outstanding common stock from 6,600,000 to

Prior to the Merger on March 16, 2000, net proceeds of approximately $233
million were raised through the private placement issuance of approximately 35
million shares of common stock. Additionally, approximately 94 million shares
of common stock held by FDC principal shareholders were cancelled at the time
of the Merger.
On March 16, 2000 FDC acquired all of the outstanding stock of FED. Under the
terms of the agreement, FDC issued approximately 105 million shares of its
common stock to FED shareholders, and issued approximately 39 million options
and warrants in exchange for existing FED options and warrants. The total
purchase price of the transaction was approximately $985 million, including
$734 million of value relating to the shares issued at a fair value of $7 per
share, the value of the simultaneous private placement transaction of similar
securities, $209 million of value relating to the options and warrants
exchanged, based on the difference between the fair value and the exercise price
of said equity instruments and $38 million of assumed liabilities. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as follows: $13 million to deferred
compensation for the portion of value of options and warrants exchanged relating
to unvested securities, $180 million to identifiable intangible assets as
valued by an independent appraisal, and $546 million to goodwill. Such goodwill
is being amortized over a three year period. The Company recorded approximately
$209 million in amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets for
the year ended December 31, 2000. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, as
clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4, amounts
assigned to in-process research and development will be charged to expense as
part of the allocation of purchase price. Accordingly, the Company recognized a
charge of approximately $128 million associated with the write-off of acquired
in-process research and technology, which is included in the accompanying
statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.
Note 8 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
Stock Option Plan
In 1994, FED established the 1994 Stock Plan the 1994 Plan, which has been
assumed by the Company. The plan provided for the granting of options to
purchase an aggregate of 1,286,000 shares of the Common Stock to employees and
consultants of FED Corporation.
In 2000, FED established the 2000 Stock Option Plan the 2000 Plan, which has
been assumed by the Company. An aggregate 3,900,000 shares of the Company
common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan. The Plan permits the
granting of options and stock purchase rights to employees and consultants of
the Company. The 2000 Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options
meeting                    62 the requirements of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 the
Code or non-statutory stock options which are not intended to meet the
requirements Section 422 of the Code.
Vesting terms of the options range from immediate vesting of all options to a
ratable vesting period of 5-1/2 years. Option activity for the year ended

under APB Opinion No. 25, under which no compensation expense has been
recognized for stock options granted to employees at fair market value. Had
compensation expense for stock options granted under the 2000 Plan and 1994 Plan
been determined based on fair value at the grant dates, the Company net loss
and net loss per share for 2000 would have been increased to the pro forma
amounts shown below.
Net loss:                           2000

Warrants
At December 31, 2000, warrants to purchase 800,260 shares of common stock are
issued and outstanding at exercise prices ranging from $172 to $2625.
Note 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Royalty Payments
The Company is obligated to make minimum annual royalty payments to a
corporation commencing January 1, 2001. Under this agreement, the Company must
pay to the corporation the greater of a minimum royalty per year, or a certain
percentage of net sales of certain products, which percentages are defined in
the agreement with the corporation. The percentages are on a sliding scale
depending on the amount of sales generated. Any minimum royalties paid may be
credited against the amounts due based on the percentage of sales.
License and Technology Agreement
In March 1997, FED entered into a technology agreement with a corporation to

To the Shareholders of FED Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of FED Corporation
a Delaware corporation in the development stage; see Note 1 and subsidiary as
of December 31, 1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations and
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for the period
from inception January 6, 1992 to December 31, 1999 and the consolidated
statements of shareholders' equity for the period from inception January 6,
1992 to December 31, 1992 and for each of the seven years ended December 31,
1999. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of FED Corporation and subsidiary
as of December 31, 1999 and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 and for the period from inception

generally accepted in the United States. New York, New York                 Arthur Andersen LLP

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND DEVELOPMENT STAGE RISKS
FED Corporation FED, together with its subsidiary the Company was formed
on January 6, 1992, to develop, manufacture and market field emitter devices or
flat panel displays. In January 1994, the Company moved its principal office
from North Carolina to New York State. In connection with this move, a Delaware
corporation was established and the North Carolina Corporation was statutorily
merged into the Delaware corporation with the latter being the survivor. During
1998, FED acquired Virtual Vision, Inc. Virtual Vision, or the Subsidiary,
a head-mounted display technology company. Virtual Vision develops and markets
head-mounted display systems for standalone and wireless computing in
commercial, industrial, and military applications.
The Company continues to be a development stage company, as defined by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 7, Accounting and Reporting by
Development Stage Enterprises, as it continues to devote substantially all of
its efforts to establishing a new business, and it has not yet commenced its
planned principal operations. Revenues earned by the Company to date are
primarily related to research and development type contracts and are not related
to the Company planned principal operations of the commercialization of
products using OLED technology.
Since inception, the Company has entered into research and development
cost-sharing arrangements, as well as research and development contracts, with
several government agencies and private industry. Through December 31, 1999,
such arrangements have provided total funding of approximately $326 million
through cost sharing arrangements and contract revenues.
Through December 31, 1999, the Company had incurred development stage losses
totaling approximately $39 million, and at December 31, 1999, had a working
capital deficit of $33 million. The Company future success is dependent upon
its ability to continue to raise capital for, among other things, 1 its
research and development efforts, 2 hiring and retaining key employees, 3
satisfaction of its commitments and 4 the successful development and marketing
of its products.
2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revenue and Cost Recognition
The Company has historically earned revenues from certain of its research and
development activities under both firm fixed-price contracts and cost-type
contracts, including some cost-plus-fee contracts. Revenues relating to firm
fixed-price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage-of-completion
method of accounting as costs are incurred cost-to-cost basis. Revenues on
cost-plus-fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees
or profits based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs.
Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and an allocation of
allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract.
Costs and Estimated Profits in Excess of Billings on Contracts in Progress
The Company records costs and estimated profits in excess of billings on
contracts in progress as an asset on its balance sheet to the extent such costs,
and related profits, if any, have been incurred under outstanding contracts and
are expected to be collected.                    75 The components of costs and estimated profits in excess of billings on contracts
in progress as of December 31, 1999 were as follows                                    1999
Total costs incurred and estimated profits     $  1,216,000
Less amounts billed                    994,000
Costs and estimated profits in excess of
billings on contracts in progress                                         $   222,000
Research and Development/Cost Sharing Arrangements
To date, activities of the Company include the performance of research and
development under cooperative agreements with United States Government agencies.
Current industry practices provide that costs and related funding under such
agreements be accounted for as incurred and earned.
The Company has entered into three cost sharing arrangements with an agency of
the U.S. Government. The Company has incurred research and development costs and
earned funding under these agreements as follows                                    1999         1998
Unfunded research and development          $ 8,997,000     $ 8,726,000
Research and development costs            2,322,000      2,787,000
Funding received                   1,148,000     1,263,000
$10,171,000     $10,250,000
Although it is not under any obligation, the Company may incur approximately
$6,700,000 of additional costs on these efforts. If such costs, as defined, are
incurred, the government is obligated to reimburse the Company for $3,326,000 of
such costs.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of
three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily
of overnight commercial paper and are stated at cost, which approximates market,
and are considered available for sale.
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, requires the classification of debt and equity securities based on
whether the securities will be held to maturity, are considered trading
securities or are available-for-sale. Classification within these categories may
require the securities to be reported at their fair market value with unrealized
gains and losses included either in current earnings or reported as a separate
component of shareholders' equity, depending on the ultimate classification.
Comprehensive Income
The Company complies with the provisions of SFAS No. 130, Reporting
Comprehensive Income, which requires companies to report all changes in equity
during a period, except those resulting from investment by owners and
distributions to owners, for the period in which they are recognized.
Comprehensive income is the total of net income and all other non-owner changes
in equity or other comprehensive income such as unrealized gains or losses on
securities classified as available-for-sale                    76 foreign currency translation adjustments and minimum pension liability
adjustments. Comprehensive and other comprehensive income must be reported on
the face of annual financial statements. The Company operations did not give
rise to any material items includable in comprehensive income which were not
already in net income for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.
Accordingly, the Company comprehensive income is the same as its net income
for all period presented.
Equipment and Leasehold Improvements
Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation on
equipment is calculated using the straight-line method of depreciation over
their estimated useful lives. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
calculated by using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated
useful lives or lease terms. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are
charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill
Excess purchase price over net assets acquired goodwill is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the business
acquired. Goodwill related to the acquisition of Virtual Vision of approximately
$4,110,000, net of accumulated amortization of $1,439,000 at December 31, 1999,
is being amortized over a period of five years.
Long-Lived Assets
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed, establishes financial accounting and
reporting standards for the impairment of long-lived assets, certain
identifiable intangibles and goodwill. SFAS No. 121 requires, among other
things, that assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be
realizable considering, among other factors, expected future undiscounted
operating cash flows of the related asset.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are recorded by applying enacted statutory tax rates to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 1999, the Company
has net deferred tax assets of approximately $143 million, primarily resulting
from the future tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards discussed below.
Such net deferred tax assets are fully offset by valuation allowances because of
the uncertainty as to their future to be realized.
At December 31, 1999, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $358 million, which expire through 2019, available to offset
future taxable income. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the
usage of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited due to
changes in ownership that have occurred. Additionally, the transaction discussed
in Note 3, will result in a further limitation of the use of such net operating
loss carryforwards.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to employees in
accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. The Company, as permitted,
elected not to adopt the financial reporting requirements of SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, for stock-based compensation granted
to                    77 employees. Accordingly, the Company has disclosed in the notes to the financial
statements the pro forma net loss for the periods presented as if the
fair-value-based method was used in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Reclassifications
Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards issued SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The statement
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and
be measured at its fair value. Additionally, any changes in the derivative
fair value are to be recognized currently in earnings, unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met. This statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company does not believe that adoption of
this statement will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.
3.    ACQUISITION
On March 16, 2000 FDC acquired all of the outstanding stock of FED. Under the
terms of the merger, FDC issued approximately 105 million shares of its common
stock to FED shareholders and issued approximately 39 million options and
warrants in exchange for existing FED options and warrants. The total purchase
price of the transaction was approximately $985 million, including $734
million of value relating to the shares issued at a fair value of $7 per share,
the value of a simultaneous private placement transaction of similar
securities, $209 million of value relating to the options and warrants
exchanged, based on the difference between the fair value and the exercise price
of said equity instruments, and $38 million of assumed liabilities. The
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
4.    ACQUISITION OF VIRTUAL VISION
In March 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Virtual
Vision for a total purchase price of $5,000,000, consisting of $500,000 in cash
and 750,000 shares of the Company Series F Preferred Stock valued at $600 per
share. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting
and the results of operations of Virtual Vision have been included in the
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The purchase
price was allocated based on the fair value of the assets acquired, determined
by management estimates, as supported by appraisal. Purchase price in excess
of net assets acquired of approximately $41 million resulted in the
acquisition, which is being amortized over a period of five years. Pro forma
results of operations for the periods prior to the                    78 acquisition are not materially different than the accompanying historical
statements of operations presented for the Company.
5.    EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Equipment and leasehold improvements and their estimated lives are as follows at
December 31, 1999                                 Useful
Lives      1999
Computer equipment and software                3     $   558,000
Lab and factory equipment                   3       3,142,000
Furniture, fixtures and office equipment           10        149,000
Leasehold improvements                 Life of lease     669,000
4,518,000
Less- Accumulated depreciation and amortization               3,304,000
$  1,214,000
Depreciation and amortization expense of equipment and leasehold improvements
for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 amounted to approximately
$810,000 and $1,026,000 respectively.
Additionally, from time to time, the Company makes deposits on certain equipment
that may ultimately be purchased by a financing company and leased to the
Company. Amounts paid by the Company for such deposits totaled approximately
$14,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.
6.    DEBT
Senior Notes Payable
In April 1995, the Company completed a private placement for the issuance and
sale of its 5% senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,000,000,
which was to mature in full on April 12, 2002, at an interest rate of 5% per
annum payable quarterly. In July 1999, as part of the Company recapitalization
Note 8, the note was converted into 5,072,464 shares of the Company common
stock. Under the original terms of the notes, the holders of the senior notes
had the right to convert the unpaid principal balance, in multiples of $1,000,
into common stock at the price of $345 per share at any time, subject to
provision for anti-dilution. In order to induce the note-holders to convert such
notes, the Company provided for a conversion rate of 4375 shares of common
stock, for each share of common stock otherwise provided for under the original
conversion terms. The Company has recorded an expense of $1,917,000 in the
accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999 as a
result of the conversion, based on an estimated fair value of $340 per share,
the value of a common share based on the Merger discussed in Note 3.
Bridge Loans
In September 1999, the Company entered into two $1,000,000 convertible loans for
an aggregate of $2,000,000. Each loan bears interest at 8% and matures in June
2000. The loans are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the
Company common stock at a purchase price equal to the per share value of the
Company most recent equity financing. In connection with these loans, the
Company issued warrants for the purchase of 167,000 shares of the Company
common stock at an exercise price                    79 of $1200 per share. The intrinsic value of these warrants of $140,000 has been
recorded as original issue discount, resulting in a reduction in the carrying
value of this debt. The original issue discount will be amortized into interest
expense over the period of the debt.
In December 1999, the Company borrowed $1,333,333 from a corporation under the
terms of a convertible note. The note was convertible into 392,157 shares of
common stock under its original terms. The loan bears interest at 8% annually
and matures in May 2000. In connection with the Merger discussed in Note 3, this
note converted into common stock. Based on the terms of the merger the
conversion terms of the debt provide for a beneficial conversion feature. The
value of the beneficial feature is recorded as an offset to the debt account and
will be amortized into interest expense over the original issuance term. At the
merger date, the remaining discount will be amortized into interest expense.
7.    LONG-TERM DEBT
Long-term debt consists of the following as of December 31, 1999                                    1999
Notes payable a                $   653,000

$   541,000
a.  In May 1999, the Company entered into a $625,000 three-year loan
agreement collateralized by its fixed assets. The aggregate
remaining principal balance is $508,421 at December 31, 1999 and
payments are due through 2002 at an interest rate of 1388%.
In June 1999, the Company entered into a $155,000 five-year
uncollateralized loan agreement. The proceeds were used to
finance a leasehold improvement. The aggregate principal balance
is $144,964 at December 31, 1999 and payments are due through
2004 at an interest rate of 18%.
b.  In connection with the acquisition of Virtual Vision, the Company
assumed a liability relating to a previous acquisition made by
Virtual Vision. At December 31, 1999, the remaining payments
under this agreement totaled $100,000, payable $50,000 per year
for each of the next two years. This agreement also provides for
additional payments over the $50,000 per year should certain
technology acquired be used in consumer applications, whereby
payments would be required based on certain percentages of
licensing and sales revenues.
c.  The Company is party to a capital lease for certain equipment
with aggregate remaining principal balance totaling $56,868 at
December 31, 1999, excluding interest, due through 2003 at an
interest rate of 727                    80     Maturity of debt as of December 31, 1999 is as follows              2000          $ 269,000
2001            351,000
2002            115,000
2003            49,000
2004            26,000
$ 810,000
8.    SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In March 2000, FED repriced approximately 325,000 common stock options issued to
employees. The repricing resulted in a non-cash compensation expense of
approximately $27 million for the period ended March 15, 2000.
In addition, FED repriced approximately 108,000 warrants issued to outside
consultants and organizations that provided bridge loans and funding commitments
to the Company. The repricing resulted in a non-cash charge of approximately
$12 million, which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of
operations for the Company period ended March 15, 2000.
In March 2000, FED issued options to purchase common stock to employees at an
exercise price below the fair market value on the date of grant of $700. These
options vest over a period of 1 - 60 months with a minimum lockup period of 18
months. As a result, the Company recorded deferred compensation expense in the
amount of approximately $125 million, which will be amortized over the vesting
period of the options.
FED also issued warrants to shareholders at an exercise price below the fair
market value on the date of grant. As a result, FED recorded a one-time
compensation expense of approximately $25 million for the period ended March
15, 2000.
The recipients of the repriced options and warrants were required to execute
lock-up agreements that prohibit disposition of the underlying shares for a
period of 18 months following the Merger. Thereafter the recipients may transfer
no more that 20% of the underlying shares in the 6 months following the end of
the 18-month period, and the balance of the underlying shares may be transferred
24-27 months after the Merger.
Common Stock
In July 1999, the Company effected a 1 for 7 reverse stock split, resulting in a
reduction of total common shares outstanding from approximately 307 million
shares to approximately 44 million shares.
During 1999, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation and was
authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of its Common Stock.
Preferred Stock
Through 1999, the Company Certificate of Incorporation provided for the
issuance of a total of 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which could be
issued in various series.                    81 Through 1998, the Company had issued an aggregate of 4,988,827 of Series A
through F preferred stock. The various series generally provided for a
liquidation preference equal to the original purchase price of the preferred
stock, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, if declared, and were generally
convertible at a rate of one share of preferred for one share of common, at the
option of the holder.
During 1999, the Company issued 681,446 shares of Series G preferred stock,
generating aggregate proceeds of approximately $3,847,000. In connection with
the issuance of the Series G preferred, the Company offered exchange credits
whereby those purchasers of Series G preferred, also holders of preferred Series
D, E and F, would exchange Series D, E and F preferred for upgrades to Series
D1, E1 and F1 preferred.
The Series G preferred provided for an immediate liquidation value of $705 per
share, in excess of the purchase price. Accordingly, a charge of approximately
$957,000 was recorded against retained earnings to accrete the value of the
preferred stock to its liquidation value.
In July 1999, the Company induced conversion of all preferred series by
providing for conversion rates and terms that were more beneficial than the
original terms. The conversion of all preferred series resulted in the issuance
of 20,124,851 shares of the Company common stock, 14,474,579 shares in excess
of the number of shares that would have been issued under the original terms of
the preferred series. Accordingly, a charge to retained earnings of
approximately $7,000,000 has been recorded, based on a fair value of
approximately $340 per common share, the fair value attributable to the
Company common stock in the Merger discussed in Note 3.
9.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
The Company has two stock-based compensation plans, described below, which
provide for the grant at fair market value. The Company applies APB Opinion No.
25 and related interpretations of accounting for its plans. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized for its fixed stock option plans and its
stock purchase plan. Had compensation cost for the Company two stock-based
compensation plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates
for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the

During 1994, the Company adopted a noncompensatory Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the ESPP, under which eligible employees may contribute up to 20% of their
base earnings, through payroll deductions, toward the purchase of the Company
Common Stock. The employees' purchase price is derived from a formula based on
the fair market value of the Common Stock. A total of 200,000 shares of Common
Stock are reserved for issuance under the ESPP, of which 8,326 were purchased by
employees during 1999. No compensation expense has been recorded in connection
with these transactions to date as the aggregate differences between the
purchase price and the fair value of the common stock purchased have been
immaterial.

Company common stock to an entity for a commitment to participate in future
financings. The warrant is exercisable for a three year period at an exercise
price of $12 per share. The exercise price is subject to change for antidilution
effects, as defined. The intrinsic value of this warrant of approximately
$71,000 was charged to the statement of operations for the year ended December
31, 1999. 10.   COMMITMENTS
