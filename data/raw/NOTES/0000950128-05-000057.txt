REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.
As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, in 2004 the Company
changed its method of accounting for LIFO inventory.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2005 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP
February 23, 2005
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania                    39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries, including the Chinese joint
venture known as Shanghai STAL Precision Stainless Steel Co., Limited STAL,
in which the Company has a 60% interest. The remaining 40% interest in STAL is
owned by Baosteel Group, a state authorized investment company whose equity
securities are publicly traded in the People Republic of China. The financial
results of STAL are consolidated into the Company operating results with the
40% interest of the Company minority partner recognized on the statement of
operations as other income or expense, and on the balance sheet in other
long-term liabilities. Investments in which the Company exercises significant
influence, but which it does not control generally a 20% to 50% ownership
interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On June 1,
2004, a subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
J Specialty Steel, LLC J, a producer of flat-rolled stainless steel
products with operations in Midland, Pennsylvania and Louisville, Ohio. As
further discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, operating
results include those of the J assets from the date of acquisition.
Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Unless
the context requires otherwise, Allegheny Technologies, ATI and the
Company refer to Allegheny Technologies Incorporated and its subsidiaries.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with United
States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable.
CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments valued at cost, which
approximates fair value, acquired with an original maturity of three months or
less.
The Company investments in debt and equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are reported at fair values, with net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on investments reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income loss.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful accounts of $84
million at December 31, 2004 and $102 million at December 31, 2003. The Company
markets its products to a diverse customer base, principally throughout the
United States. Trade credit is extended based upon evaluations of each
customer ability to perform its obligations, which are updated periodically.
Accounts receivable reserves are determined based upon an aging of accounts and
a review for collectibility of specific accounts.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost last-in, first-out LIFO,
first-in, first-out FIFO, and average cost methods or market, less progress
payments. Costs include direct material, direct labor and applicable
manufacturing and engineering overhead, and other direct costs. Most of the
Company inventory is valued utilizing the LIFO costing methodology. Inventory
of the Company non-U.S. operations is valued using average cost or FIFO
methods.
The Company evaluates product lines on a quarterly basis to identify
inventory values that exceed estimated net realizable value. The calculation of
a resulting reserve, if any, is recognized as an expense in the period that the
need for the reserve is identified. It is the Company general policy to
write-down to scrap value any inventory that is identified as obsolete and any
inventory that has aged or has not moved in more than twelve months. In some
instances this criterion is up to twenty-four months.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. The principal method of
depreciation adopted for all property placed into service after July 1, 1996 is
the straight-line method. For buildings and equipment acquired prior to July 1,
1996, depreciation is computed using a combination of accelerated and
straight-line methods. Significant enhancements that extend                    40 the lives of property and equipment are capitalized. Costs related to repairs
and maintenance are charged to expense in the year incurred. The cost and
related accumulated depreciation of property and equipment retired or disposed
of are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in
income.
The Company monitors the recoverability of the carrying value of its
long-lived assets. An impairment charge is recognized when the expected net
undiscounted future cash flows from an asset use including any proceeds from
disposition are less than the asset carrying value and the asset carrying
value exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale are stated at the
lower of their fair values or carrying amounts and depreciation is no longer
recognized.
COST IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED
At December 31, 2004, the Company had $2053 million of goodwill on its balance
sheet. Of the total, $1121 million related to the Flat-Rolled Products segment 671 million related to the High Performance Metals segment, and $261 million
related to the Engineered Products segment. Goodwill increased $69 million
during 2004 as a result of the impact of foreign currency translation on
goodwill denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The
Company accounts for goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142,
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for
impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The impairment
test for goodwill requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit
that has goodwill associated with its operations with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If this comparison reflects impairment, then the loss would
be measured as the excess of recorded goodwill over its implied fair value.
Implied fair value is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over
the fair value of all recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities.
The evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment includes estimating the
fair market value of each of the reporting units which have goodwill associated
with their operations using discounted cash flow and multiples of cash earnings
valuation techniques, plus valuation comparisons to recent public sale
transactions of similar businesses, if any. These valuation methods require the
Company to make estimates and assumptions regarding future operating results,
cash flows, changes in working capital and capital expenditures, selling prices,
profitability, and the cost of capital. Although the Company believes that the
estimates and assumptions used were reasonable, actual results could differ from
those estimates and assumptions. The Company performs the required annual
goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year. No impairment
of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
or 2002.
ENVIRONMENTAL
Costs that mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or extend the
life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of property
utilized in current operations are capitalized. Other costs that relate to
current operations or an existing condition caused by past operations are
expensed. Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Company liability is
probable and the costs are reasonably estimable, but generally not later than
the completion of the feasibility study or the Company recommendation of a
remedy or commitment to an appropriate plan of action. The accruals are reviewed
periodically and, as investigations and remediations proceed, adjustments of the
accruals are made to reflect new information as appropriate. Accruals for losses
from environmental remediation obligations do not take into account the effects
of inflation, and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present
value. The accruals are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance
carriers or other third parties, but do reflect allocations among potentially
responsible parties PRPs at Federal Superfund sites or similar state-managed
sites after an assessment is made of the likelihood that such parties will
fulfill their obligations at such sites and after appropriate cost-sharing or
other agreements are entered. The measurement of environmental liabilities by
the Company is based on currently available facts, present laws and regulations,
and current technology. Such estimates take into consideration the Company
prior experience in site investigation and remediation, the data concerning
cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities, and the
professional judgment of the Company environmental experts in consultation
with outside environmental specialists, when necessary.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING
As part of its risk management strategy the Company, from time-to-time,
purchases futures and swap contracts to manage exposure to changes in nickel
prices, a component of raw material cost for some of its flat-rolled and high
performance metals products, and natural gas, a significant energy cost for all
of the Company businesses. The contracts obligate the Company to make or
receive a payment equal to the net change in value of the contract at its
maturity. These contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash
flows of a portion of the Company forecasted purchases of nickel and natural
gas payments. The majority of these contracts mature within one year. The
Company accounts for all of these contracts as hedges under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities SFAS 133. Changes in the fair value of these
contracts are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income                    41 loss in stockholders' equity until the hedged item is recognized in the
statement of operations within cost of sales. If a portion of the contract is
ineffective as a hedge of the underlying exposure, the change in fair value
related to the ineffective portion is immediately recognized as income or
expense in the statement of operations within cost of sales.
Foreign currency exchange contracts are used to limit transactional exposure
to changes in currency exchange rates. The Company sometimes purchases foreign
currency forward contracts that permit it to sell specified amounts of foreign
currencies expected to be received from its export sales for pre-established
U.S. dollar amounts at specified dates. The forward contracts are denominated in
the same foreign currencies in which export sales are denominated. These
contracts are designated as hedges of the variability in cash flows of a portion
of the forecasted future export sales transactions which otherwise would expose
the Company to foreign currency risk. The Company accounts for all of these
contracts as hedges under SFAS 133. Changes in the fair value of these contracts
are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss in
stockholders' equity until the hedged item is recognized in the statement of
operations. If a portion of the contract is ineffective as a hedge of the
underlying exposure, the change in fair value related to the ineffective portion
is immediately recognized as income or expense in the statement of operations.
Derivative interest rate contracts are used from time-to-time to manage the
Company exposure to interest rate risks. For example, in 2003 and 2002, the
Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for the receipt of fixed rate
amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the
contracts without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. These
contracts are designated as fair value hedges. As a result, changes in the fair
value of these swap contracts and the underlying fixed rate debt are recognized
in the statement of operations.
In general, hedge effectiveness is determined by examining the relationship
between offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the item
being hedged and the financial instrument being used for the hedge.
Effectiveness is measured utilizing regression analysis and other techniques, to
determine whether the change in the fair market value or cash flows of the
derivative exceeds the change in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item.
Calculated ineffectiveness, if any, is immediately recognized on the statement
of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, calculated
ineffectiveness was not material to the results of operations.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
Assets and liabilities of international operations are translated into U.S.
dollars using year-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are
translated at average exchange rates during the period. The resulting net
translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss in stockholders' equity.
SALES RECOGNITION
Sales are recognized when title passes or as services are rendered.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Company funded research and development costs were $82 million in 2004, $115
million in 2003 and $120 million in 2002 and were expensed as incurred.
Customer funded research and development costs were $17 million in 2004, $24
million in 2003 and $27 million in 2002. Customer funded research and
development costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in
accordance with revenue recognition policies.
INCOME TAXES
The provision for, or benefit from, income taxes includes deferred taxes
resulting from temporary differences in income for financial and tax purposes
using the liability method. Such temporary differences result primarily from
differences in the carrying value of assets and liabilities. Future realization
of deferred income tax assets requires sufficient taxable income within the
carryback, carryforward period available under tax law. The Company evaluates,
on a quarterly basis whether, based on all available evidence, it is probable
that the deferred income tax assets are realizable. Valuation allowances are
established when it is estimated that it is more likely than not that the tax
benefit of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The evaluation, as
prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, includes the consideration of all available evidence, both
positive and negative, regarding historical operating results including recent
years with reported losses, the estimated timing of future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, estimated future taxable income exclusive of
reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, and potential tax planning
strategies which may be employed to prevent an operating loss or tax credit
carryforward from expiring unused.
NET INCOME LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic and diluted net income loss per share are calculated by dividing the net
income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. The calculation of diluted net                    42 loss per share excludes the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding stock
options since the inclusion in the calculation of additional shares in the net
loss per share would result in a lower per share loss and therefore be
anti-dilutive.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for its stock option plans and other stock-based
compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related Interpretations. Under APB Opinion No. 25, for awards
which vest without a performance-based contingency, no compensation expense is
recognized when the exercise price of the Company employee stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock at the date of the grant.
Compensation expense for fixed stock-based awards, generally awards of nonvested
stock, is recognized over the associated employment service period based on the
fair value of the stock at the date of the grant. The Company also has
performance-based stock award programs which are accounted for under the
variable plan rules of APB Opinion No. 25. Compensation expense for these awards
of stock, which are earned based on performance-based criteria, is recognized at
the measurement date based on the stock price at the end of the performance
period, with compensation expense recognized at interim dates based on
performance criteria achieved and the Company stock price at the interim
dates.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and net
income loss per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. For comparative presentation
purposes, the effect of the 2003 deferred tax valuation allowance is excluded
from the 2003 stock-based compensation net of tax amounts. In millions, except per share amounts          2004       2003       2002

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Effective January 1, 2003, as required, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations SFAS 143. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with the
retirement of tangible long-lived assets, such as landfill and other facility
closure costs, are capitalized and amortized to expense over an asset useful
life using a systematic and rational allocation method. The Company adoption
of SFAS 143 resulted in recognizing a charge of $13 million, net of income
taxes of $07 million, or $002 per share, principally for asset retirement
obligations related to landfills in the Company Flat-Rolled Products segment.
This charge is reported in the consolidated statement of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2003 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.
In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 Medicare Act was signed into law. The Medicare Act
provides for a Federal subsidy, with tax-free payments commencing in 2006, to
sponsors of retiree health care plans that provide a benefit that is at least
actuarially equivalent to the benefit established by law. In May 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003 FSP 106-2, which provides guidance on the accounting for the effects
of the Medicare Act. Under FSP 106-2, the effect of the Federal subsidy is
accounted for as an actuarial experience gain. In addition, the effect of the
Medicare Act is taken into consideration, as appropriate, in determining an
employer future per capita claims cost. Based upon estimates from the
Company actuaries, it is expected that the effect of the Medicare Act will
result in a reduction in the Accumulated Other Postretirement Benefits
obligation of $46 million. The benefit to the Company will be recognized over
multiple years as a reduction to postretirement benefits expense. The Company
adopted FSP 106-2 in the beginning of the third quarter 2004, resulting in
approximately $2 million lower postretirement benefit expense in 2004. For 2005,
the reduction in expense as a result of the Medicare Act is estimated to be
approximately $3 million.
In December 2004, the FASB finalized Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. This revised standard
addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company                    43 receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the
company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company equity
instruments. Under the revised standard, companies will no longer be able to
account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, as described in the Stock-based
Compensation section of this Note 1. Instead, companies will be required to
account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize expense in
the consolidated statements of income. SFAS 123R is effective for interim or
annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS 123R no later than the beginning of the 2005 third quarter. ATI will adopt
SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method and reflect compensation expense
in accordance with the FAS 123R transition provisions. Under the modified
prospective method, prior periods are not restated to reflect the impact of
adopting the new standard at earlier dates.
Pro forma disclosures regarding the effect on the Company net income
loss, and net income loss per common share in 2004 and prior years, had the
Company applied the fair value method of accounting for share-based compensation
as prescribed by SFAS 123, are contained in the Stock-based Compensation
section of this Note 1. The Company has not yet determined which fair value
model it will use for future grants of share-based compensation. Based on
share-based compensation granted through December 31, 2004 and the fair values
previously calculated under SFAS 123, the Company projects it would record an
immaterial amount of additional compensation expense in 2005 related to stock
options and nonvested stock upon the adoption of SFAS 123R compared to the
existing accounting method under APB Opinion No. 25. The Company is still
evaluating the impact this new standard will have on its Total Shareholder
Return share-based compensation plan.
In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 Jobs Creation
Act was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act contains a number of provisions
that may affect the Company future effective income tax rate. The most
significant provisions would allow the Company to elect to deduct from its
taxable income 85% of certain eligible dividends received by the Company from
non-U.S. subsidiaries before the end of 2005 if those dividends are reinvested
in the U.S. for eligible purposes, and separately, enable the Company to receive
a tax deduction of up to 9%, when fully phased in over several years, to
qualified production activities income, as defined. In December 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production
Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-1,
which requires the qualified production activities deduction to be treated as a
special deduction which would therefore be recognized as earned. FSP 109-1 was
effective upon issuance, and required no adjustment to recorded deferred tax
balances, which are determined using projected future income tax rates. In
December 2004, the FASB also issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2, Accounting
and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 FSP 109-2, which provided additional
time beyond the financial statement date of the period in which a new tax law is
enacted, or December 31, 2004 for ATI, for a company to evaluate the effect of
the Jobs Creation Act. In accordance with the provisions of FSP 109-2, ATI
continues to evaluate the repatriation provision, including ongoing
clarifications of how the Jobs Creation Act is to be applied. Based on this
evaluation, the Company is unable to determine if there will be any material
impact to 2005 results from the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision of the
Jobs Creation Act.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with the 2004
presentation.
NOTE 2. ACQUISITION OF J SPECIALTY STEEL LLC ASSETS  On June 1, 2004, a subsidiary of the Company acquired substantially all of the
assets of J Specialty Steel LLC, a producer of flat-rolled stainless steel
products with operations in Midland, Pennsylvania and Louisville, Ohio.
Consideration for the acquisition of $670 million consisted of a payment of
$75 million at closing, the issuance to the seller of a non-interest bearing
$75 million promissory note that matures on June 1, 2005, the issuance to the
seller of a promissory note in the principal amount of $520 million, which is
secured by the J property, plant and equipment acquired, and which is subject
to adjustment on the terms set forth in the asset purchase agreement and has a
final maturity of July 1, 2011, and the assumption of certain current
liabilities. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase business
combination. The acquired operations have been integrated into the Allegheny
Ludlum operations, which are part of the Company Flat-Rolled Products business
segment.
The closing of the acquisition followed the ratification, on May 28, 2004,
of a new labor agreement with the United Steelworkers of America USWA, which
represents employees at the Company Allegheny Ludlum operations and at the
former J operations. The new labor agreement expires in June 2007, and
provides for a workforce restructuring through the reduction in the number of
production and maintenance job grades from 34 to five, and the implementation of
flexible work rules. The number of production and maintenance employees at the
pre-acquisition Allegheny Ludlum facilities is being reduced by 650 employees
through an early retirement program over two and a half years pursuant to which
the USWA-represented employees are being offered Transition Assistance Program
TAP incentives, to be paid from the Company                    44 defined benefit pension trust. The new labor agreement also includes a cap on
the Company retiree medical costs. In the 2004 second quarter, the Company
recorded charges of $253 million for the TAP incentives, and also recorded a
$58 million charge as a result of other costs associated with the new labor
agreement and the J asset acquisition.
The following is a summary of the preliminary purchase price allocation of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed or recognized in conjunction with
the acquisition based upon their estimated fair market values. In millions                   Allocated Purchase Price

Total liabilities                     522
Purchase price - net assets acquired           $    670
Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, the final purchase price of
the J assets is subject to adjustment based upon the final value of the net
working capital acquired. This adjustment is expected to be finalized in the
2005 first quarter. The purchase price of the J assets is based on the net
working capital acquired, and the fair value of the net assets acquired, which
included substantially all production assets, is in excess of the purchase
price. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
Business Combinations SFAS 141, the excess of fair value over the purchase
price represents negative goodwill, which has been allocated as a pro rata
reduction to the amounts that would otherwise have been assigned to the acquired
noncurrent assets, principally property, plant and equipment.
The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the Company
includes the results of operations of the J asset acquisition as if it had
been consummated as of the beginning of the periods presented, including the
effects of the new labor agreement as it pertains to the former J facilities,
the effects of the assigned fair value under SFAS 141 of property, plant and
equipment acquired, and the effects of the indebtedness incurred to fund the
asset acquisition. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information is
based on historical information and does not purport to represent what the
actual consolidated results of operations of the Company would have been had
these transactions occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily
indicative of future consolidated results of operations. The unaudited pro forma
financial information does not give affect to additional cost savings and
synergies that the Company has achieved and anticipates achieving following the
acquisition. In millions, except per share data               PRO FORMA    Pro Forma

Total inventories                        $   5130   $   3597
Inventories, before progress payments, determined on the last-in, first-out
LIFO method were $4138 million at December 31, 2004 and $2924 million at
December 31, 2003. The remainder of the inventory was determined using the
first-in, first-out FIFO and average cost methods. These inventory values do
not differ materially from current cost. The effect of using the LIFO
methodology to value inventory, rather than FIFO, increased decreased cost of
sales in 2004, 2003 and 2002 by $1122 million, $370 million and $26
million, respectively.
In the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company changed its method of
calculating LIFO inventories at its Allegheny Ludlum subsidiary by reducing the
overall number of Company-wide inventory pools from 15 to eight, and by changing
its calculation method for LIFO from the double-extension method to the
link-chain method. The Company made the change in order to better match costs
with revenues, to reflect the business structure of Allegheny Ludlum following
the J asset acquisition, to provide for a LIFO adjustment more representative
of Allegheny Ludlum actual inflation on its inventories, and to conform LIFO
accounting methods with other ATI operations that use the LIFO inventory method.
The cumulative effect of the change in methods and the pro forma effects of the
change on prior years' results of operations were not determinable. The effect
of the change on the results of operations for 2004 was not material.
During 2004 and 2003, inventory usage resulted in liquidations of LIFO
inventory quantities. These inventories were carried at the lower costs
prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of current purchases. The
effect of these LIFO liquidations was to decrease cost of sales by $06 million
in 2004 and by $79 million in 2003.

interest rate swap contracts at December 31, 2003.
Interest expense was $384 million in 2004, $339 million in 2003 and $373
million in 2002. Interest expense was reduced by $09 million in 2004 and $21
million in 2003 from interest capitalization on capital projects. Interest and
commitment fees paid were $380 million in 2004, $392 million in 2003, and
$375 million in 2002. Net interest expense includes interest income of $29
million in 2004, $62 million in 2003, and $30 million in 2002. Interest income
in 2003 increased due to $40 million related to a Federal income tax refund
associated with prior years.                    46   Scheduled maturities of borrowings during the next five years are $294
million in 2005, $43 million in 2006, $354 million in 2007, $147 million in
2008 and $114 million in 2009.
In December 2001, the Company issued $300 million of 8375% Notes due
December 15, 2011 which are registered under the Securities Act of 1933.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, on June 15 and December 15, and
is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. These Notes contain
default provisions with respect to default for the following, among other
things: nonpayment of interest on the Notes for 30 days, default in payment of
principal when due, or failure to cure the breach of a covenant as provided in
the Notes. Any violation of the default provision could result in the
requirement to immediately repay the borrowings. These Notes are presented on
the balance sheet net of issuance costs of $53 million, which are being
amortized over the term of the Notes.
In 2002, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts with respect
to a $150 million notional amount related to the Notes, which involved the
receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments
over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the underlying principal
amount. These receive fixed, pay floating arrangements were designated as fair
value hedges, and effectively converted $150 million of the Notes to variable
rate debt. As a result, changes in the fair value of the swap contracts and the
notional amount of the underlying fixed rate debt are recognized in the
statement of operations. In 2003, the Company terminated the majority of these
interest rate swap contracts and received $153 million in cash. Subsequent to
the interest rate swap terminations, in 2003 the Company entered into new
receive fixed, pay floating interest rate swap arrangements related to the
Notes which re-established, in total, a $150 million notional amount that
effectively converted this portion of the Notes to variable rate debt. In the
2004 third quarter, the Company terminated all remaining interest rate swap
contracts still outstanding, and realized net cash proceeds of $15 million. The
gains on settlement realized in 2004 and 2003 remain a component of the reported
balance of the Notes, and are ratably recognized as a reduction to interest
expense over the remaining life of the Notes, which is approximately seven
years. At December 31, 2004, the deferred settlement gain was $137 million. The
result of the receive fixed, pay floating arrangements was a decrease in
interest expense of $44 million, $67 million and $49 million for the years
ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, compared to the fixed
interest expense of the ten-year Notes.
During the 2003 second quarter, the Company entered into a $325 million
four-year senior secured domestic revolving credit facility the secured credit
facility or the facility. The facility, which replaced a $250 million
unsecured facility, is secured by all accounts receivable and inventory of the
Company U.S. operations and included capacity for up to $150 million of
letters of credit. On April 15, 2004, the lenders under the secured facility
consented to amend the facility to allow for the acquisition of the J assets
by one of the Company subsidiaries, increase letters of credit capacity by $25
million, to $175 million, allow prepayment of indebtedness in certain
circumstances, and revise certain other provisions including the threshold for
when the financial covenant is measured, as described below. As of December 31,
2004, there had been no borrowings made under either the secured credit facility
or the former unsecured credit facility since the beginning of 2002. The
Company outstanding letters of credit issued under the secured credit facility
were approximately $121 million at December 31, 2004.
The secured credit facility limits capital expenditures, investments and
acquisitions of businesses, new indebtedness, asset divestitures, payment of
dividends, and common stock repurchases which the Company may incur or undertake
during the term of the facility without obtaining permission of the lending
group. At December 31, 2004, the amount of dividends the Company could pay
without the consent of the lending group was approximately $300 million. In
addition, the secured credit facility contains a financial covenant, which is
not measured if the Company undrawn availability under the facility is equal
to or more than $150 million. This financial covenant, when measured, requires
the Company to maintain a ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization EBITDA to fixed charges of at least 10 to
10. EBITDA is adjusted for non-cash items such as income/loss on investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting, non-cash pension
expense/income, and that portion of retiree medical and life insurance expenses
paid from the Company VEBA trust. EBITDA is reduced by capital expenditures,
as defined in the facility, and cash taxes paid, and increased for cash tax
refunds. Fixed charges include gross interest expense, dividends paid and
scheduled debt payments. At December 31, 2004, the Company undrawn
availability under the facility, which is calculated including outstanding
letters of credit, other uses of credit and domestic cash on hand, was $325
million, and the amount that the Company could borrow at that date prior to
requiring the application of a financial covenant test was $175 million.
Borrowings under the secured credit facility bear interest at the Company
option at either: 1 the one-, two-, three- or six- month LIBOR rate plus a
margin ranging from 225% to 300% depending upon the level of borrowings; or
2 a base rate announced from time-to-time by the lending group i.e. the Prime
lending rate plus a margin ranging from 0% to 075% depending upon the level of
borrowings. In addition, the secured credit facility contains a facility fee of
025% to 050% depending on the level of undrawn availability. The facility also
contains fees for issuing letters of credit of 0125% per annum and annualized
fees ranging from 225% to 300% depending on the level of undrawn availability
under the facility. The Company overall borrowing costs under the secured
credit facility are not affected by changes in the Company credit ratings.                    47
The Company subsidiaries also maintain credit agreements with various
foreign banks, which provide for borrowings of up to approximately $63 million.
At December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately $24 million of available
borrowing capacity under these foreign credit agreements. These agreements
provide for annual facility fees of up to 020%.
The Company has no off-balance sheet financing relationships with
variable interest entities, structured finance entities, or any other
unconsolidated entities. At December 31, 2004, the Company has not guaranteed
any third-party indebtedness.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating the fair value of its financial instruments     Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount on the balance sheet
approximates fair value.
Interest rate swap agreements: The fair values were obtained from the
agreement counterparties.
Short-term and long-term debt: The fair values of the Allegheny
Technologies 8375% Notes and the Allegheny Ludlum 695% debentures
were based on quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of the other
short-term and long-term debt approximate fair value.
Accounts receivable are presented net of a reserve for doubtful
accounts of $84 million at December 31, 2004 and $102 million at December 31,
2003. During 2004, the Company made no increases for doubtful accounts and wrote
off $18 million of uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve. During
2003, the Company recognized expense of $22 million to increase the reserve for
doubtful accounts and wrote off $21 million of uncollectible accounts, which
reduced the reserve. During 2002, the Company recognized expense of $18 million
to increase the reserve for doubtful accounts and wrote off $40 million of
uncollectible accounts, which reduced the reserve.
Accrued liabilities included salaries and wages of $452 million and
$271 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.                    48     Property, plant and equipment at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as

would have been recognized.                    49 NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  PREFERRED STOCK
Authorized preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, with
designations, powers and preferences as shall be designated by the Board of
Directors. At December 31, 2004, there were no shares of preferred stock issued.
COMMON STOCK
On July 28, 2004, the Company completed a public offering of 138 million shares
of common stock at $1750 per share, and received $2297 million in net proceeds
after underwriting costs and expenses. The 138 million shares were re-issued
from treasury stock. Per share amounts for 2004 reflect the effect of the public
offering on a weighted average basis for the periods presented.
During 2000, the Company adopted the Allegheny Technologies
Incorporated 2000 Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan. Options granted under
the Incentive Plan, and predecessor plans, have been granted at not less than
market prices on the dates of grant. Options granted under the Incentive Plan
have a maximum term of 10 years. Vesting of stock options granted under the
Incentive Plan generally occurs in three annual increments, beginning on the
first anniversary of the grant date.
The Company accounts for its stock option plans in accordance with APB
Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related
Interpretations. Under APB Opinion 25, for awards that vest without a
performance-based contingency, no compensation expense for stock option plans is
recognized because the exercise price of the Company employee stock options
equals the market price of the underlying stock at the date of the grant. If
compensation cost for these stock option awards had been determined using the
fair-value method prescribed by FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, SFAS 123 net income would have been reduced by
$38 million or $004 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2004,
and net loss would have increased by $33 million or $004 per diluted share,
and $38 million or $004 per diluted share for the years ended December 31,
2003, and 2002, respectively. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions                                    2004      2003      2002

The Company sponsors other share-based compensation programs, which
resulted in compensation expense of $206 million in 2004, $126 million in
2003, and $08 million in 2002. These recognized amounts included reversals of
$19 million in 2002 for adjustments to prior years' incentive compensation
expenses based on changes to estimates of compensation made at interim
measurement dates.
In 2004, the Company granted 289,560 shares of nonvested stock under a
new stock incentive plan, with an aggregate grant date fair value of
$33 million. Under the terms of this grant, one-half of the nonvested stock
performance shares vests only on the attainment of an income statement
metric, measured over a cumulative three-year period comprising fiscal years
2004, 2005 and 2006. The remaining nonvested stock vests over a service period
of five years, with accelerated vesting to three years if the performance
shares' vesting criterion is attained. Under the requirements of APB Opinion
No. 25, the performance shares are marked-to-market, with ratable expense
recognition based on estimates of whether the performance criterion will be
attained, and the measurement date stock price equal to the current market price
of the Company stock. As of December 31, 2004, the income statement metric was
presently being attained, and one-third of the expense was recognized based on
the December 31, 2004 stock price.
In 2003, the Company granted 547,290 shares of nonvested stock with an
aggregate grant date fair value of $23 million. The shares vest over service
periods ranging from three to five years. For the year ended December 31, 2004,
175,505 shares of nonvested stock relating to the 2003 grants had vesting
accelerated due to the achievement of the performance target in accordance with
the provisions of the Incentive Plan. Compensation expense recognized for this
vesting acceleration was $03 million. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
176,399 shares of nonvested stock relating to the 2003 grants and other prior
grants had vesting accelerate due to participant retirements, in accordance with
retirement provisions in the Incentive Plan. Compensation expense recognized for
this vesting acceleration was $05 million. There were 532,369 and 422,800
shares of nonvested stock outstanding under all stock plans at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively.
In prior years, the Company maintained a Stock Acquisition and
Retention Program SARP. Under the SARP, certain executives could purchase
shares of the Company common stock in exchange for a promissory note payable
to the Company, and the Company would match the purchase with a grant of a
certain number of shares of non-vested common stock. After the enactment of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Board of Directors effectively terminated the
SARP and no further loans or purchases were permitted. As a net result of the
termination of the SARP in September 2003, the Company received approximately
$05 million in cash and recorded $56 million of expenses, which is included in
selling and administrative expenses in the statement of operations.
In the 2003 third quarter, the Company initiated a stock option
repurchase program whereby stock option plan participants, not including
statutory insiders and certain other executives, could elect to sell to the
Company, for $010 per option share, certain vested stock options. Approximately
18 million stock option shares were repurchased by the Company under this
program, which expired in October 2003.
The Company sponsors a Total Shareholder Return Plan TSRP, which
measures the Company stock price performance over cumulative three-year
periods compared to a peer group. Compensation to participants is payable in the
form of stock. Interim measures of stock price performance are recorded
quarterly. Based on the Company 2004 stock price performance, $181 million of
compensation expense for the TSRP was recognized for the year ended December 31,
2004. An award was earned for the 2002 - 2004 TSRP performance period based on
the Company stock price performance for the three-year period ending
December 31, 2004, which resulted in the issuance of 100,792 shares of stock to
participants in the 2005 first quarter.
At December 31, 2004, approximately 35 million shares of common stock
were available for future awards under the Incentive Plan.                    51 UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INVESTEES
Stockholders' equity includes undistributed earnings of investees accounted for
under the equity method of accounting of approximately $21 million at December
31, 2004.
STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN
Under the Company stockholder rights plan, each share of Allegheny
Technologies common stock is accompanied by one right to purchase two
one-hundredths of a share of preferred stock for $100. Each two hundredths of a
share of preferred stock would be entitled to dividends and to vote on an
equivalent basis with one share of common stock. The rights are neither
exercisable nor separately transferable from shares of common stock unless a
party acquires or effects a tender offer for more than 15% of Allegheny
Technologies common stock. If a party acquired more than 15% of the Allegheny
Technologies common stock or acquired the Company in a business combination,
each right other than those held by the acquiring party would entitle the
holder to purchase common stock or preferred stock at a substantial discount.
The rights expire on March 12, 2008, and the Company Board of Directors can
amend certain provisions of the plan or redeem the rights at any time prior to
their becoming exercisable.
NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109, in the 2003 fourth quarter, the
Company recorded a $1385 million charge as part of its income tax provision to
establish a valuation allowance for the majority of its Federal net deferred tax
assets in recognition of uncertainty regarding full realization. In 2004, the
Company provided an additional $101 million valuation allowance to reflect the
continued uncertainty regarding full realization of these tax attributes, which
was included in determining the 2004 effective tax rate. No valuation allowance
was required on $530 million of net deferred tax assets based upon the
Company ability to utilize these assets within the carryback, carryforward
period, including consideration of tax planning strategies that the Company
would undertake to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from
expiring unutilized. The Company intends to maintain a valuation allowance on
the net deferred tax assets until a realization event occurs to support reversal
of all or a portion of the reserve.

In general, the Company is responsible for filing consolidated U.S.,
foreign and combined, unitary or separate state income tax returns. The Company
is responsible for paying the taxes relating to such returns, including any
subsequent adjustments resulting from the redetermination of such tax liability
by the applicable taxing authorities. Income taxes paid were $112 million in
2004, substantially all relating to foreign operations. Income taxes paid in
prior years were $39 million in 2003, and $20 million in 2002. The Company
received $72 million in federal income tax refunds and $02 million in state
income tax refunds in 2004. No provision has been made for U.S., state or
additional foreign taxes related to undistributed earnings of foreign
subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently re-invested.
Income loss before income taxes included income loss from domestic
operations of $18 million in 2004, $2791 million in 2003, and
$998 million in 2002.                    52    The following is a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the

For 2004, the Company recorded a tax loss, which was available to offset
taxes computed at statutory rates. The 2003 effective tax rate includes the
effect of establishing a valuation allowance for a majority of the Company net
deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for 2003, absent the deferred tax
valuation allowance, would have been 376%. The effective tax rate for 2002 was
366%.
Deferred income taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition
of income and expense for financial and income tax reporting purposes, and
differences between the fair value of assets acquired in business combinations
accounted for as purchases for financial reporting purposes and their
corresponding tax bases. Deferred income taxes represent future tax benefits or
costs to be recognized when those temporary differences reverse. The categories
of assets and liabilities that have resulted in differences in the timing of the
recognition of income and expense at December 31, 2004 and 2003 were as follows In millions                                    2004        2003

The Company has $1889 million and $1788 million in deferred tax asset
valuation allowances at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Based on
current tax law, the Company has federal net operating loss tax carryforwards
which will expire as follows: $425 million will expire in 2023 and $47 million
will expire in 2024. The Company also had state net operating loss tax
carryforwards of approximately $40 million at both December 31, 2004 and 2003.
For most of these state net operating loss tax carryforwards, expiration will
occur in 20 years and utilization of the tax benefit is limited to $2 million
per year. A valuation allowance has been established for the full value of these
state net operating loss carryforwards since the Company has concluded that it
is more likely than not that these tax benefits would not be realized prior to
expiration.                    53
NOTE 9. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company has defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans
covering substantially all employees. Benefits under the defined benefit pension
plans are generally based on years of service and/or final average pay. The
Company funds the U.S. pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal
Revenue Code.
The Company also sponsors several postretirement plans covering certain
salaried and hourly employees. The plans provide health care and life insurance
benefits for eligible retirees. In certain plans, Company contributions towards
premiums are capped based on the cost as of a certain date, thereby creating a
defined contribution. For the non-collectively bargained plans, the Company
maintains the right to amend or terminate the plans at its discretion.
Components of pension expense income for the Company defined
benefit plans and components of other postretirement benefit expense included
the following                                           EXPENSE INCOME

In 2004, in conjunction with the new labor agreement at the Company
Allegheny Ludlum operations, a $253 million charge for pension termination
benefits was recognized for a Transition Assistance Program TAP. The TAP
incentive is being paid from the Company U.S. defined benefit pension fund
through 2006 to a total of 650 employees. The new labor contract, described in
Note 2. Acquisitions, also includes caps on the Company retiree medical
benefit costs. Also in 2004, the Company modified retiree medical benefits for
certain non-collectively bargained current and former employees to cap the
Company cost of benefits, beginning in 2005, and then eliminate the benefits
in 2010. As a result of these actions, a $715 million curtailment and
settlement gain was recognized in the 2004 second quarter, comprised of a
one-time reduction of postretirement benefit expense, net of a $05 million
charge to pension expense.
In 2003, the Company recorded termination benefits expense of
$74 million related to workforce reductions which is included in restructuring
costs in the statement of operations.
In 2002, the Company recorded $17 million of non-cash income on the
curtailment of postretirement benefits for terminated employees related to work
force reductions in the Flat-Rolled Products segment. This amount is included in
restructuring costs in the statement of operations.

postretirement benefits assets will be 875% and 90%, respectively, and the
discount rate used to develop pension and postretirement benefit expense will be
61%. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumptions, the
Company evaluated input from its third party pension plan asset managers and
actuaries, including reviews of their asset class return expectations and
long-term inflation assumptions.

A The other postretirement benefits obligation at end of 2003 did not
include the expected favorable impact of the Medicare Act, which was signed into
law on December 8, 2003. The Medicare Act provides for a federal subsidy, with
tax-free                    55 payments commencing in 2006, to sponsors of retiree health care benefits plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the benefit
established by the law. Based upon estimates from the Company actuaries, the
federal subsidy included in the law reduced the other postretirement benefits
obligation in 2004 by $46 million. This reduction is recognized in the financial
statements over a number of years as an actuarial experience gain, which is
expected to reduce other postretirement benefit expense by approximately $3
million in 2005.
The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension
plans was $2,0936 million and $1,9723 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The plan invests in a diversified portfolio consisting of an array of
asset classes that attempts to maximize returns while minimizing volatility.
These asset classes include U.S. domestic equities, developed market equities,
emerging market equities, private equity, global high quality and high yield
fixed income. The Company continually monitors the investment results of these
asset classes and its fund managers, and explores other potential asset classes
for possible future investment. During 2003, the Company entered into a risk
reduction program with respect to the pension fund investments in U.S. domestic
equities. The goal of the program was to reduce the potential impact to the
plan funded status of a further decline in the U.S. equity markets.
The plan assets for the defined benefit pension plan at December 31,
2004 and 2003 include 13 million shares of Allegheny Technologies common stock
with a fair value of $282 million and $172 million, respectively. Dividends of
$03 million were received by the plan in both 2004 and 2003 on the Allegheny
Technologies common stock held by the plan.
The Company is not required to make cash contributions to its U.S.
defined benefit pension plan for 2005 and, based upon current actuarial studies,
does not expect to be required to make cash contributions to its U.S. defined
benefit pension plan for at least the next several years. However, ATI may
elect, depending upon the investment performance of the pension plan assets and
other factors, to make voluntary cash contributions to this pension plan in the
future. The Company expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its
nonqualified benefit pension plans in 2005, equal to the amount of expected
benefit payments for these plans. The Company contributes on behalf of its union
employees at its Oremet facility to a pension plan, which is administered by the
USWA and funded pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. Pension expense
and contributions to this plan were $07 million in 2004, and $06 million in
2003 and in 2002.
In accordance with labor contracts, the Company funds certain retiree
health care benefits for Allegheny Ludlum using plan assets held in a Voluntary
Employee Benefit Association VEBA trust. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company was able to fund $182 million, $142 million, and $127 million,
respectively, of retiree medical costs using the assets of the VEBA trust. The
Company may continue to fund certain retiree medical benefits utilizing the plan
assets held in the VEBA if the value of these plan assets exceed $25 million.
The value of the assets held in the VEBA was approximately $100 million as of
December 31, 2004. The Company expects to contribute between $30 and $35 million
to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2005, representing the non-VEBA
funded portion of expected benefit payments.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were $132 million in
2004, $105 million in 2003, and $121 million in 2002. Company contributions to
the defined contribution plans are funded with cash.

The annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered

2005 and is assumed to gradually decrease to 50% in the year 2014 and remain at
that level thereafter. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant
effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point

The annual measurement date for the Company retirement benefits is
November 30. At November 30, 2004, the value of the accumulated pension benefit
obligation ABO exceeded the value of pension assets by approximately $245
million. A minimum pension liability was recognized in 2002 as a result of a
severe decline in the equity markets from 2000 through 2002, higher benefit
liabilities from long-term labor contracts negotiated in 2001, and a lower
assumed discount rate for valuing liabilities. Accounting standards require a
minimum pension liability to be recorded and the pension asset recorded on the
balance sheet to be written off if the value of pension assets is less than the
ABO at the annual measurement date. Accordingly, in the 2002 fourth quarter, the
Company recorded a charge against stockholders' equity of $406 million, net of
deferred taxes, to write off the prepaid pension cost representing the
overfunded position of the pension plan, and to record a deferred pension asset 122 million at December 31, 2004, for unamortized prior service cost relating
to prior benefit enhancements. In the fourth quarter of 2004 and 2003, the
Company adjustment of the minimum pension liability resulted in an increase to
stockholders' equity of $2 million for 2004 and $47 million for 2003, presented
as other comprehensive income loss. These charges and adjustments did not
affect the Company results of operations and do not have a cash impact. In
addition, they do not affect compliance with debt covenants in the Company
bank credit agreement. In accordance with accounting standards, the full charge
against stockholders' equity would be reversed in subsequent years if the value
of pension plan investments returns to a level that exceeds the ABO as of a
future annual measurement date.

NOTE 11. CURTAILMENT GAIN, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES  CURTAILMENT GAIN AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company recorded a $404 million
curtailment gain, net of restructuring costs, which includes the $715 million
curtailment and settlement gain and the $253 million pension termination
benefit charge discussed in Note 9. Pension Plans and Other Postretirement
Benefits, and $58 million in restructuring charges in the Flat-Rolled Products
segment related to the new labor agreement and the J asset acquisition.
Charges included labor agreement costs of $46 million, severance costs of
$07 million related to approximately 30 salaried employees, and $05 million
for asset impairment charges for redundant equipment following the J asset
acquisition. At December 31, 2004, approximately $06 million of the
restructuring charges represent future cash payments that are expected to be
paid within one year.
In 2003, the Company recorded charges of $624 million, including
$475 million for impairment of long-lived assets in the Company Flat-Rolled
Products segment, $111 million for workforce reductions across all business
segments and the corporate office, and $38 million for facility closure charges
including present-valued lease termination costs, net of forecasted sublease
rental income, at the corporate office. In the 2003 fourth quarter, based on
existing and projected operating levels at the Company remaining operations in
Houston, PA and its Washington Flat Roll coil facility located in Washington,
PA, it was determined that the net book values of these facilities were in
excess of their estimated fair market values based on expected future cash
flows. Charges for the Houston facility and the Washington Flat Roll coil
facility were recorded to write down the book values of these facilities to
their estimated fair market values. These asset impairment charges did not
impact current operations at these facilities. The workforce reductions affected
approximately 375 employees across all segments and the corporate office.
In 2002, the Company recorded total charges of $428 million related to
the indefinite idling of the Massillon, OH stainless steel plate facility, due
to continuing poor demand for wide continuous mill plate products, and workforce
reductions across all of the Company operations. The Massillon, OH stainless
steel plate facility was indefinitely idled in the 2002 fourth quarter and
resulted in a pretax non-cash asset impairment charge of $344 million,
representing the book value of the facility in excess of its estimated fair
market value. In addition, during the second half of 2002, and in light of the
continuing decline in demand for the Company products in the markets served,
the Company announced workforce reductions of approximately 665 employees. These
workforce reductions resulted in a severance charge of $84 million, net of a
retirement benefits curtailment gain.
Reserves for restructuring charges recorded in 2003 and 2002 involving
future payments were approximately $5 million at December 31, 2004 and
$9 million at December 31, 2003. The reduction in reserves resulted from cash
payments to meet severance and lease payment obligations.                    60 OTHER GAINS AND CHARGES
In 2004, the Company recognized non-recurring gains of $129 million, including
$55 million related to net gains on sales of real estate and realization of
other investments, a $46 million environmental reserve reduction related to the
settlement of the Clean Water Act case see additional discussion in Note 14.
Commitments and Contingencies, income from corporate-owned life insurance of
$12 million, partially offset by closed company charges of $88 million
primarily related to litigation.
In 2003, the Company recorded $347 million in other charges, including
closed company charges of $225 million for litigation, $76 million for
environmental and insurance matters, and $46 million for various non-operating
asset impairments. Closed company charges were determined based on the status of
legal matters including court proceedings, and on updated estimates of the
Company liability for environmental closure costs and for liabilities under
retrospectively-rated insurance programs. In the consolidated statement of
operations, litigation and environmental charges are classified in selling and
administrative expenses and insurance charges are classified in cost of sales.
In 2002, the Company recorded $65 million in charges relating to its
approximately 30% equity interest in New Piper Aircraft, Inc. New Piper,
including equity in net losses of New Piper and the write-down of the Company
investment to its estimated realizable value. Based on New Piper fourth
quarter 2002 realization of additional losses and adverse trends in its
liquidity and financial condition, the Company determined in the 2002 fourth
quarter that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of its equity
interest in New Piper was not recoverable. These charges are classified in other
income expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Weighted average shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
which were antidilutive, and thus not included in the calculation, were
16 million in 2004, 75 million in 2003 and 59 million in 2002.
NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  Rental expense under operating leases was $180 million in 2004, $175 million
in 2003, and $159 million in 2002. Future minimum rental commitments under
operating leases with non-cancelable terms of more than one year at December 31,
2004, were as follows: $156 million in 2005, $130 million in 2006 118 million in 2007, $45 million in 2008, $36 million in 2009 and
$75 million thereafter.
When it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset of
the Company has been impaired, a loss is recognized if the amount of the loss
can be reasonably estimated.
Asset retirement obligation ARO liabilities, related to landfills,
total $19 million at December 31, 2004. Estimates of ARO liabilities are
evaluated annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequency if material new
information becomes known. Changes in estimated landfill closure dates, the cash
flows associated with closure activities, and accretion expense for the
recognized liabilities have not been material since the adoption of the ARO
accounting standard, SFAS 143, on January 1, 2003. The accounting for asset
retirement obligations requires significant estimates. In certain cases, the
Company has determined that an ARO exists, but the amount of the obligation is
not reasonably estimable. The Company may determine that additional AROs are
required to be recognized as new information becomes available.                    67     The Company maintains reserves for contingent tax liabilities, for
differences between the benefit of tax deductions as filed on various income tax
returns and recorded income tax provisions. These liabilities are estimated
based on analyses of probable return-to-provision adjustments using currently
available information.
The Company is subject to various domestic and international
environmental laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants, and
disposal of wastes, and which may require that it investigate and remediate the
effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past
and present operations. The Company could incur substantial cleanup costs,
fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal
injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or
noncompliance with environmental permits required at its facilities. The Company
is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of its
current and former sites, as well as third party sites.
Environmental liabilities are recorded when the Company liability is
probable and the costs are reasonably estimable. In many cases, however, the
Company is not able to determine whether it is liable or, if liability is
probable, to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. Estimates of the
Company liability remain subject to additional uncertainties, including the
nature and extent of site contamination, available remediation alternatives, the
extent of corrective actions that may be required, and the number,
participation, and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties
PRPs. The Company expects that it will adjust its accruals to reflect new
information as appropriate. Future adjustments could have a material adverse
effect on the Company results of operations in a given period, but the Company
cannot reliably predict the amounts of such future adjustments.
Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe
that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding the amount already
accrued for any of the sites with which the Company is currently associated
either individually or in the aggregate will be an amount that would be
material to a decision to buy or sell the Company securities. Future
developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental
matters, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company
financial condition or results of operations.
At December 31, 2004, the Company reserves for environmental
remediation obligations totaled approximately $287 million, of which
approximately $84 million were included in other current liabilities. The
reserve includes estimated probable future costs of $88 million for federal
Superfund and comparable state-managed sites; $90 million for formerly owned or
operated sites for which the Company has remediation or indemnification
obligations; $58 million for owned or controlled sites at which Company
operations have been discontinued; and $51 million for sites utilized by the
Company in its ongoing operations. The Company continues to evaluate whether it
may be able to recover a portion of future costs for environmental liabilities
from third parties.
The timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by
site. The Company expects that it will expend present accruals over many years
and that remediation of all sites with which it has been identified will be
completed within thirty years.
Various claims have been or may be asserted against the Company related
to its government contract work, principally related to the former operations of
Teledyne, Inc. Such proceedings could result in fines, penalties, compensatory
and treble damages or the cancellation or suspension of payments under one or
more U.S. government contracts. Although the outcome of these matters cannot be
predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe any pending matter of
which management is aware is likely to have a material adverse effect on the
Company financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any
reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse
effect on the Company results of operations for that period.
In June 1995, the U.S. Government commenced an action against Allegheny
Ludlum in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania alleging multiple violations of the Federal Clean Water Act for
incidents at five facilities. In February 2002, the Court issued a decision
imposing a penalty of $82 million for incidents at five facilities that
occurred over a period of approximately six years which Allegheny Ludlum had
reported to the appropriate environmental agencies. The Company appealed the
decision, and, on April 29, 2004 the Third Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
decision and remanded the case to the District Court for further consideration.
Prior to the retrial of the case, the U.S. Government and Allegheny Ludlum
agreed to settle the case in full for approximately $24 million, to be paid by
Allegheny Ludlum in early 2005. Results of operations in 2004 includes the
reversal of approximately $58 million in reserves as a result of this
settlement.
In March 1995, Kaiser Aerospace & Electronics Corporation Kaiser
filed a civil complaint against Teledyne Industries, Inc. now TDY Industries,
Inc. TDY, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and others in state
court in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The complaint alleged that TDY breached a
Cooperation and Shareholder Agreement with Kaiser. TDY and Kaiser currently
are engaged in discovery. Kaiser seeks unspecified damages in an amount to be
determined at trial. The court has directed the parties to complete any
mediation in early August 2005, and if necessary be prepared to try the case in
September 2005. While the outcome of the litigation cannot be predicted, and the
Company believes that the claims are not meritorious, an adverse resolution of
this matter could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations and financial condition.                    68     TDY Industries, Inc. and the San Diego Unified Port District Port
District are involved in litigation concerning property located in San Diego,
California. TDY entered into three sublease arrangements for portions of the
property, subject to the approval of the Port District, which the Port District
refused. After its administrative appeal was denied, TDY commenced a lawsuit in
state court in San Diego against the Port District. TDY alleged breach of
contract and other causes of action relating to the Port District failure to
consent to the subleases. The Port District filed a cross-complaint against TDY
alleging breach of contract. Following trial, in March 2004, the jury rendered a
verdict in favor of the Port District. The Company recorded a litigation expense
charge of $225 million to its 2003 operating results as a result of this
verdict. Judgment was entered on the cross-complaint in the amount of $227
million, including related costs and prejudgment interest. TDY appealed the
verdict in the California State Court of Appeals in July 2004. At December 31,
2004, the Company had adequate reserves for this matter.
In June 2003, the Port District commenced a separate action in United
States District Court for the Southern District of California against TDY
asserting federal, state and common law claims related to alleged environmental
contamination on the San Diego property. The complaint seeks an unspecified
amount of damages and a declaratory judgment as to TDY liability for
contamination on the property. In the second quarter 2004, the court granted in
part TDY motion to dismiss portions of the complaint relating to alleged
violations of state law. TDY has answered essentially denying all remaining
claims, asserting a counterclaim and seeking injunctive relief. TDY has also
asserted claims against neighboring property owners and former operators related
to the environmental condition of the San Diego facility.
In another matter related to the San Diego facility, the Port District
requested that the California Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC
evaluate whether the property is regulated as a hazardous waste transportation,
storage, or disposal facility under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
RCRA and similar state laws. In response to the Port District request, in
2003, DTSC concluded that the closure of four solid waste management units at
the San Diego facility is subject to DTSC oversight. The Company is evaluating
data from the Site to respond to DTSC positions.
TDY has conducted an environmental assessment of portions of the San
Diego facility at the request of the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control
Board Regional Board, and the Port District has commenced a site-wide
environmental investigation. At this stage of the assessment, TDY cannot predict
if any remediation will be necessary beyond the work identified in the prior
investigations. In October 2004, the Regional Board issued an order directing
that TDY investigate contamination at the site and conduct a clean up if
necessary. TDY appealed the order, which has been held in abeyance pending the
outcome of the Company additional investigation directed primarily at
neighboring properties.
While the outcome of these environmental matters cannot be predicted
with certainty, and the Company believes that the claims against it are not
meritorious, an adverse resolution of the matters relating to the San Diego
facility could have a material adverse affect on the Company results of
operations and financial condition.
TDY and another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, among others,
have been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency EPA as PRPs
at the Li Tungsten Superfund Site in Glen Cove, New York. The Company believes
that most of the contamination at the site resulted from work done while the
U.S. Government either owned or controlled operations at the site, or from
processes done for various governmental agencies, and that the U.S. Government
is liable for a substantial portion of the remediation costs at the site. In
November 2000, TDY filed a cost recovery and contribution action against the
U.S. Government. In March 2003, the Court ordered the parties to the action to
fund a portion of the remediation costs at the site. In July 2004, TDY, the U.S.
Government and the EPA entered into an Interim Agreement, under which the U.S.
Government funded $209 million and TDY funded $1 million of the remediation
costs at the site. TDY and the U.S. Government are mediating the cost recovery
and contribution action. In addition, EPA agreed that TDY will not be required
to perform additional work at the site and will not be subject to enforcement
action prior to the earlier of March 18, 2005, or the conclusion of the
mediation. TDY expects to seek contribution from other PRPs at the site. Based
on information presently available, the Company believes its reserves on this
matter are adequate. An adverse resolution of this matter could have a material
adverse effect on the Company results of operations and financial condition.
Since 1990, TDY has been operating under a Corrective Action Order from
EPA for a facility that TDY owns and formerly operated in Hartville, Ohio. TDY
has prepared a plan to carry out additional remediation activities, which has
been approved by EPA. The Company believes its reserves for the continued
operation of the interim system and for costs it expects to incur for the
additional remediation activities are adequate.
A number of other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be
asserted against the Company relating to the conduct of its currently and
formerly owned businesses, including those pertaining to product liability,
patent infringement, commercial, employment, employee benefits, taxes,
environmental and health and safety, and stockholder matters. While the outcome
of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and some of these lawsuits,
claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to the Company, management
does not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Company financial condition or
liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company results of
operations for that period.                    69 NOTE 15. SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED                                              Quarter Ended

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the
Company disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004, and they
concluded that these controls and procedures are effective.                    70 MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over
financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company principal executive and principal financial
officers and effected by the company board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that     Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company     Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute
assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent
limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that
involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and
breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial
reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override.
Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the
financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the
process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
The Company management assessed the effectiveness of the Company
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making
this assessment, the Company management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the Treadway Commission
Internal Control-Integrated Framework.
Based on our assessment, management has concluded that, as of December
31, 2004, the Company internal control over financial reporting is effective
based on those criteria.
The Company independent registered public accounting firm that
audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report issued an
attestation report on our management assessment of the Company internal
control over financial reporting.
MANAGEMENT'S CERTIFICATIONS
The certifications of the Company Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been included as Exhibits 31 and
32 in the Company Report on Form 10-K. In addition, in 2004, the Company
Chief Executive Officer provided to the New York Stock Exchange the annual CEO
certification regarding the Company compliance with the New York Stock
Exchange corporate governance listing standards. s/ L. Patrick Hassey

ALLEGHENY TECHNOLOGIES INCORPORATED
We have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Allegheny
Technologies Incorporated management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
A company internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, management assessment that Allegheny Technologies
Incorporated maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the
COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Allegheny Technologies Incorporated
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance
sheets of Allegheny Technologies Incorporated as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of
