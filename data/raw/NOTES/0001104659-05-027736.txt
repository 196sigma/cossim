19 MANAGEMENTS
ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is
defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule13a-15f or 15d-15f. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the Company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Companys assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. The scope of managements assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting includes the
Companys consolidated subsidiaries, except for certain businesses acquired by
the Company on March2, 2005 as permitted by the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Companys consolidated net sales for the year ended March31,
2005 were $7790 million, of which the certain businesses acquired by the
Company on March2, 2005, represented $93 million. The Companys consolidated total assets as of
March31, 2005 were $5902 million, of which the certain businesses
acquired by the Company on March2, 2005, represented $642 million. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.
Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
Control Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March31,
2005. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control
over financial reporting as of March31, 2005 has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included on page 22. 20 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors
and Stockholders
Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consolidated Graphics,Inc.
and subsidiaries as of March31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2005. These consolidated
financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Consolidated Graphics, Inc. and subsidiaries
as of March31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31,
2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States, the effectiveness of Consolidated Graphics, Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of March31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, and our report dated June9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
on managements assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
over financial reporting.

21 Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors
and Stockholders 
Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. We
have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Consolidated Graphics, Inc. the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our
opinion, managements assessment that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of March31, 2005, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued
by COSO. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31,
2005, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by COSO. The
Company acquired certain businesses on March2, 2005, and management
excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over
financial reporting as of March31, 2005, the certain businesses internal
control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $642 million,
and total revenues of $93 million included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended March31,
2005. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the
certain businesses. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the
Company and its subsidiaries as of March31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows
for each of the years in the three-year period ended March31, 2005, and
our report dated June9, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries referred
to as the Company is a leading national provider of commercial printing
services with 70 printing businesses in 25 states and is recognized as the
largest sheetfed and half-web commercial printing company in the United States.
The Company is focused on adding value to its printing businesses by providing
the financial and operational strengths, management support and technological
advantages associated with a national organization. The Companys printing
businesses maintain their own sales, customer service, estimating and planning,
prepress, production and accounting departments. The Companys corporate
headquarters staff provides support to its printing businesses in such areas as
human resources, purchasing and management information systems. The Company
also maintains centralized treasury, risk management, tax and consolidated
financial reporting activities. The Companys sales are
derived from commercial printing services. These services consist of
itraditional print services, including electronic prepress, printing,
finishing, storage and delivery of high-quality printed documents which are
custom manufactured to the Companys customers design specifications;
iifulfillment and mailing services for such printed materials, and
iiie-commerce solutions that enable the Companys customers to improve
their processes over the procurement and management of printed materials. The scope and extent of
services provided to the Companys customers typically varies for each
individual order it receives, depending on customer-specific factors including
the intended uses for the printed materials. Furthermore, each of the Companys
locations generally is capable of providing a complete range of services to
their customers. Accordingly, the Company
does not operate its business in a manner that differentiates among its respective
capabilities and services for financial or management reporting services,
rather each of its printing businesses define a distinct reporting unit. 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER INFORMATION Accounting
Policies The accounting policies
of the Company reflect industry practices and conform to generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. The more significant of such accounting
policies are described below. Principles
of ConsolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information, the Companys operations constitute one
reportable segment because all of its printing businesses operate in the
commercial printing industry and exhibit similar economic characteristics. Use of
EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of
certain estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities as of
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates and
assumptions on an ongoing basis and relies on historical experience and various
other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances to
determine such estimates. Because uncertainties with respect to estimates and
assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements, actual
results could differ from these estimates. ReclassificationCertain
reclassifications of prior periods data have been made to conform to the
current period reporting. Cash
and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be
cash equivalents. 27 Revenue
Recognition and Accounts ReceivableThe Company recognizes
revenue upon delivery of each job, except for bill and hold transactions, in
which case such revenue is recognized when all the service delivery criteria
are fully met as per Staff Bulletin 104 issued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC. Losses, if any, on jobs are recognized at the earliest date
such amount is determinable. The Company derives the majority of its revenues
from sales and services to a broad and diverse group of customers with no
individual customer accounting for more than 10% of the Companys revenues in
any of the years ended March31, 2005, 2004 or 2003. The Company maintains
an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of
accounts receivable. Accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets are reflected net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2,465
and $2,448 at March31, 2005 and 2004. InventoriesInventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first-in, first-out
method for raw materials and the specific identification method for work in
progress and finished goods. The carrying values of inventories are set forth
below

Other
AssetsOther assets are principally comprised of deferred tax
assets, non-current cash invested in restricted money-market funds and
intangible assets other than goodwill. None of the individual items in other
assets at March31, 2005 and 2004 were individually greater than 5% of
total current assets in those years. Impairment
of Long-Lived AssetsThe Company determines the realization
of goodwill in accordance with SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and its other long-lived
assets, including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets other
than goodwill in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
Under SFAS No142, the Company determines fair value using capitalization
of earnings estimates and market valuation multiples for each reporting unit.
Under SFAS No144, the Company compares the carrying value of long-lived
assets to its projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such
assets, and evaluates other factors such as business trends and general
economic conditions. In the event that the carrying value exceeds the future
undiscounted cash flows, the Company records an impairment charge against
income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the assets fair value. Accrued
LiabilitiesThe significant components of accrued liabilities

Other accrued liabilities
are principally comprised of customer advances and accrued self-insurance
claims for certain insurance programs. None of the individual items in other
accrued liabilities at March31, 2005 and 2004 were individually greater
than 5% of total current liabilities in those years. Income
TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date. 28 Recent
Accounting Pronouncements The Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No151, Inventory Costs, in November2004 which amends Chapter 4
of the Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No. 43. SFASNo151 is
required to be applied to all inventory costs occurring in
fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company has yet to determine the impact
that the expected April1, 2006 adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. SFAS No152, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions,
was issued in December2004 and amends SFAS No. 66 and No. 67.
SFASNo153 is required to be applied to all real
estate time-sharing transactions occurring in fiscal years beginning after June15,
2005. The Companys expected April1,
2006 adoption of SFAS No. 152 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, was issued in December2004
and amends Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 29.
SFASNo153 is required to be applied to all nonmonetary exchanges
occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June15,
2005. The Companys expected July1,
2005 adoption of SFAS No. 153 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment, was issued in December2004 and
replaces SFAS No. 123, and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123R will require compensation
costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the
consolidated financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of
compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the
equity or liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be
remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the
period that an employee provides services in exchange for the award. SFAS No. 123R becomes effective for the
Company at the beginning of fiscal 2007. The Company expects that the impact of
adopting the SFAS No. 123R will be materially consistent with the pro forma
expense discussed below under Stock-Based Compensation,
adjusted for future vesting occurrences, grants, cancellations and exercises of
stock options, that have been previously disclosed in accordance with SFAS No.
123. SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, was
issued in May 2005 and replaces APB
Opinion No. 20 and SFAS No. 3.
SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in
accounting principle in most instances and is required to be applied to all accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after December15,
2005. The Companys expected April1,
2006 adoption of SFAS No. 154 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Other
Information Supplemental
Cash Flow InformationThe consolidated statements of cash
flows provide information about the Companys sources and uses of cash and
exclude the effects of non-cash transactions. The Company issued term notes
payable totaling $13,252 and $7,506 see Note 6. Long-Term Debt in the years
ended March31, 2005 and 2004 to finance the purchase of certain new
equipment. In addition, in the year ended March31, 2005, the Company
assumed a mortgage obligation totaling $5,116 in connection with a prior year
acquisition and also assumed two industrial revenue bonds totaling $4,900 and
other long-term debt of $3,351 in connection with current year acquisitions
see Note 4. Acquisitions. The Company paid or
received cash for interest and income taxes, net of refunds, totaling $4,877
and $13,680 in 2005, $7,227 and $2,460in 2004, and $10,286 and $534
in 2003. Earnings
Loss Per ShareBasic earnings loss per share are
calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect net income
divided by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive stock
options outstanding. Conversely, diluted
loss per share excludes the impact of dilutive stock options outstanding and
therefore reflects net loss divided only by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding. Related
Party TransactionsIn the normal course of business, the
Company leases certain real estate from individuals who formerly owned an
acquired printing business and are now employed by the Company. Fair
Value of Financial InstrumentsThe Companys financial
instruments consist of cash, trade receivables, trade payables and debt
obligations. The Company does not currently hold or issue derivative financial
instruments. The Company believes that the fair value of its variable rate debt
obligations, which totaled $81,072 and $43,431 at March31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively, approximated their recorded values. The Company estimates that
the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling $38,418 at 29 March31, 2005 was $33,961
and that the fair value of its fixed rate debt obligations totaling $68,038 at March31,
2004 was $69,717. Estimates of fair value are based on interest rates for the
same or similar debt offered to the Company having the same or similar
maturities and collateral requirements. Concentrations
of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily trade accounts
receivable. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts
receivable are limited because the Companys printing businesses provide
services to a large, diverse group of customers in various geographical
regions. Management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and
generally does not require collateral for extensions of credit. The Companys
cash deposits are held in large, national financial institutions. Stock-Based
CompensationThe Company accounts for its stock-based
compensation programs using the intrinsic value method of accounting
established by APBOpinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations. Under APB
No25, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of
an employee stock option is equal to the market price of common stock on the
grant date and all other provisions of the grant are fixed. The Companys only
element of stock-based compensation is derived pursuant to the Consolidated
Graphics,Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended the Plan, which
has been approved by the Companys shareholders. Under the Plan, employees of
the Company and certain non-employee members of the Companys Board of
Directors have been, or may be, granted options to purchase shares of the
Companys common stock at a price not less than the market price of the stock
at the date of grant. Pro forma
information regarding net income loss and net income loss per share is
required by SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. The pro forma information has been determined as if
the Company had accounted for its stock options under the fair value method.
The following is a summary of the Companys net income loss and net income
loss per share as reported and pro forma as if the fair value-based method of
accounting defined in SFASNo123 had been applied. For purposes of
pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to
expense over the options vesting period. The pro forma effects of applying
SFASNo123 may not be representative of the effects on reported net
income for future years since options vest over several years and additional
awards are made each year. Pro forma information
applying to the fair value method follows

30 The Black-Scholes model
used by the Company to calculate the fair value of options granted, as well as
other currently accepted option valuation models, were developed to estimate
the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable options without vesting
and/or trading restrictions, which significantly differ from the provisions
associated with the Companys stock option awards. These models also require
highly subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and
expected time until exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values.
Accordingly, management does not believe this model provides a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Companys stock option awards. 3.
ACCOUNTING CHANGE Effective April1,
2002, the Company adopted SFAS No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets, which required it to discontinue
amortizing goodwill, perform an initial transitional impairment test and
conduct annual impairment tests to determine if the remaining balance of
goodwill of each of its reporting units should be reduced to reflect its
estimated fair value. Prior to its adoption of SFAS No142, the Company
periodically evaluated whether the remaining balance of goodwill was
recoverable by assessing current and future levels of income and cash flows on
an undiscounted basis, as well as other factors, such as business trends and
general market conditions. The Company determined that each of its individual
printing businesses constitutes a stand alone reporting unit under SFAS
No142. The Company determines fair value under SFAS No142 using
capitalization of earnings estimates and market valuation multiples. A number
of factors could cause the Company to further impair its goodwill balance at
the date of its annual impairment test, which is March31. These factors
include a decline in the financial performance of an individual reporting unit
due to adverse business developments and/or changes in general market
conditions, as well as a decline in market valuation multiples. As of April1,
2002, net goodwill balances attributable to each of the Companys reporting
units were tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting
unit to its carrying value. Based on these impairment tests, the Company
recognized a transitional impairment charge of $74,376, net of deferred tax
benefit totaling $15,379, which is reflected as a cumulative effect of
accounting change in the accompanying consolidated income statement. As a result of its annual
valuation test, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $38,033
for the year ended March31, 2003, which is reflected as goodwill
impairment in the accompanying consolidated income statement. The impairment
resulted principally from the impact that the continued weakness in printing
industry conditions and other negative economic factors had on the Companys
reporting units. Had the provisions
of SFAS No142 been in effect for all periods presented in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, net income loss and earnings
loss per share as reported would have been reported on the following pro

ACQUISITIONS All of the Companys
acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
Revenues and expenses of the acquired businesses have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements beginning on their respective
dates of acquisition. The allocation of purchase price to the acquired assets
and liabilities is based on estimates of fair value and may be prospectively
revised if and when additional information the Company is awaiting concerning
certain asset and liability valuations is obtained, provided that such
information is received no later than one year after the date of acquisition.
Contingent transaction consideration pursuant to earnout agreements is accrued
as an additional cost of the transaction when payment thereof is deemed to be
probable by the Company. During fiscal 2005, the
Company assumed debt totaling $8,251 and acquired for cash totaling $45,524 the
operations and assets of eight printing businesses. The preliminary allocation
of the purchase price of the businesses acquired include current assets of
$22,799, property and equipment of $33,116, goodwill of $11,521 and other
assets of $2,678 less current liabilities of $16,339. The Company is awaiting
additional information concerning certain asset and liability valuations in
order to finalize such allocation, and expects to receive such information no
later than one year following the respective dates of the acquisitions. During fiscal 2004, the
Company acquired for cash totaling $10,042 the operations and assets of six printing
businesses. The allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired
include current assets of $3,503, property and equipment of $8,063, goodwill of
$1,764 and other assets of $533, less current liabilities of $3,821. During fiscal 2003, the
Company acquired for cash totaling $4,205 the operations and assets of two printing
businesses. The allocation of the purchase price of the businesses acquired
include current assets of $3,627, property and equipment of $1,012 and other
assets of $655, less current liabilities of $1,089. Additionally, in
connection with the acquisition of certain printing businesses in prior periods,
the Company paid cash in fiscal 2005 totaling $3,299 and assumed a related
mortgage obligation totaling $5,116 to acquire certain real property and paid
cash of $138, $1,334, and $2,035 in fiscal years 2005, 2004, and 2003 to
satisfy certain liabilities or pursuant to earnout agreements. 31 5.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment
are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The costs of major
renewals and betterments are capitalized; repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed when incurred. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various
classes of assets. The following is a

The Companys primary bank
credit facility as amended and restated, the Credit Agreement is composed
of a $150,000 revolving credit facility that will mature in July2007. At March31,
2005, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were $65,000 and
accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 481%. The proceeds from
borrowings under the Credit Agreement can be used to repay certain
indebtedness, finance certain acquisitions, provide for working capital and
general corporate purposes and, subject to certain restrictions, repurchase the
Companys common stock. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement are
secured by substantially all of the Companys assets other than real estate and
certain equipment subject to term equipment notes and other financings.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest, at the Companys option,
at either 1the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a margin of
125% to 200%, or 2an alternate base rate based upon the greater of
the agent banks prime lending rate or the Federal Funds effective rate plus.50% plus a margin of up to 75%. The Company is also required to pay an
annual commitment fee ranging from 275% to 375% on available but unused
amounts under the Credit Agreement. The interest rate margin and the commitment
fee are based upon certain financial performance measures as set forth in the
Credit Agreement and are redetermined quarterly. At March31, 2005, the
applicable LIBOR interest rate margin was 125% and the applicable commitment
fee was 275%. The Company is subject to
certain covenants and restrictions and must meet certain financial tests under
the Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with such covenants,
restrictions and financial tests at March31, 2005. 32 In addition to the Credit
Agreement, the Company maintains two auxiliary revolving credit facilities
each an Auxiliary Bank Facility and collectively the Auxiliary Bank
Facilities with commercial banks. Each Auxiliary Bank Facility is unsecured
and has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5,000. One such facility expires in November2005
and the other such facility expires in November2006. At March31,
2005, borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank Facilities totaled $5,195
and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 419%. Because the Company currently
has the ability to refinance borrowings outstanding under the Auxiliary Bank
Facility expiring in November2005 and plans to do so, such borrowings are
classified as long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at March31,
2005. The Auxiliary Bank Facilities
cross-default to the covenants and restrictions set forth in the Credit
Agreement. The Companys term
equipment notes consist primarily of notes payable pursuant to financing
agreements between the Company and various lenders the Lender Notes and
between the Company and the finance affiliate of a printing equipment
manufacturer the Equipment Notes. At March31, 2005, outstanding
borrowings under the Lender Notes totaled $17,164 and accrued interest at a
weighted average rate of 474%. The Lender Notes provide for fixed monthly
principal payments plus interest at fixed rates for defined periods of up to
seven years from the date of issuance, and are secured by certain equipment of
the Company. At March31, 2005, outstanding borrowings under the Equipment
Notes totaled $13,403 and accrued interest at a weighted average rate of 593%.
The Equipment Notes provide for fixed payments of principal and interest at
fixed rates for defined periods of up to ten years from the date of issuance
and are secured by the equipment which was concurrently purchased from the
manufacturer. At March31, 2005, the remaining balance of term equipment
notes totaling $1,728 primarily consists of various secured debt obligations
assumed by the Company in connection with certain prior year acquisitions. The
Company is not subject to any significant financial covenants in connection
with any of the term equipment notes; however, the Credit Agreement places
certain limitations on the amount of additional term note obligations the
Company may incur in the future. In the period ended March31,
2005, the Company retired $41,061 of Lender Notes with borrowings from the
Credit Agreement. The purpose of retiring these notes was to utilize available
capacity under the Credit Agreement to effect an overall reduction in the
Companys interest costs. No financial penalties were incurred in connection
with the retirement of these obligations. The Companys remaining
debt obligations consist of a mortgage totaling $4,975, a promissory note
totaling $2,652, industrial revenue bonds totaling $8,085 and various other
debt totaling $1,288. The Company does not have any significant financial
covenants or restrictions associated with these other debt obligations. The principal payment
requirements by fiscal year under the Companys debt obligations referenced
above are: 2006$7,595; 2007$11,018; 2008$75,009; 2009$6,409; 2010$8,784;
and thereafter$10,675. As the Company has both the ability and intent to
refinance the $2,303 outstanding at March31, 2005 under the Auxiliary
Bank Facility due to expire in November2005, such borrowings are classified
as long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet at March31, 2005, and
also classified above as fiscal 2008 principal payment requirements in
conjunction with the maturity of the Credit Agreement. 7.

Deferred income taxes
reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts as measured based
on enacted tax laws and regulations. The Company records a valuation allowance,
when appropriate, to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount the
Company expects to realize. The Company considers the amount of taxable income
available in carryback years and future taxable income, among other factors, in
assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance. The components of
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Operating
LeasesThe Company has entered into various noncancelable
operating leases primarily related to facilities and equipment used in the
ordinary course of its business. The Company incurred total operating lease
expense of $15,213, $14,748 and $13,627 for the years ended March31,

Letters
of CreditIn connection with the assumption of obligations
under outstanding industrial revenue bonds related to certain prior year
acquisitions of printing businesses, which are reflected as debt in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had four letters of
credit outstanding as of March31, 2005 for a combined total of $8,436.
These letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of our Credit
Agreement, which expires in July2007, and we may be required to obtain
replacement letters of credit at that time. 34 Insurance
ProgramsThe Company maintains third-party insurance coverage
in amounts and against risks it believes are reasonable in its circumstances.
The Company is self-insured against most workers compensation claims and for a
significant component of its group health insurance programs. For these
exposures, the Company accrues expected loss amounts which are determined using
a combination of its historical loss experience and subjective assessment of
its future loss exposure, together with advice provided by administrators and
consulting actuaries. The estimates of expected loss amounts are subject to
uncertainties arising from various sources, including changes in claims
reporting patterns, claims settlement patterns, judicial decisions, legislation
and economic conditions. Although the Company believes that the accrued
estimated loss amounts are reasonable under the circumstances, significant
differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our risk
exposure, insurance obligations and future expense. Legal
MattersFrom time to time, the Company is subject to legal
proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business.
Currently, there are no legal proceedings or claims pending against the Company
that management believes will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys
consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Tax
MattersThe Company is subject to examination by tax
authorities for varying periods in various taxing jurisdictions. During the course of such examinations
disputes occur as to matters of fact and/or law. Also, in most taxing jurisdictions the
passage of time without examination will result in the expiration of applicable
statutes of limitations thereby precluding the taxing authority from conducting
an examination of the tax period for which such statute of limitation has
expired. The Company believes that it
has adequately provided for its tax liabilities. 9. STOCK
OPTIONS Employees of the Company
and certain non-employee members of the Companys Board of Directors have been,
or may be, granted options to purchase shares of the Companys common stock
pursuant to the Plan. Options granted pursuant to the Plan may either be
incentive stock options within the meaning of Section422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or non-qualified stock options. Options
granted under the Plan are at a price not less than the market price of the
stock at the date of grant and periodically vest over a fixed period of up to
ten years. Unvested options generally expire upon termination of employment and
vested options expire six months after termination of employment. Otherwise,
options expire after final vesting at the end of a fixed period not in excess
of five years. At March31, 2005, a total of 2,452,516 shares were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Plan, of which 751,730 shares of the
Companys common stock were reserved for options which had not been granted. The following table sets
forth option transactions under the Plan
