Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of CSG Systems International, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f or 15d-15f under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Companys internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:  i
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
ii
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and  iii
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and
procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2008. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an attestation report on
the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008. That report appears immediately below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders CSG Systems International, Inc.:
We have audited CSG Systems International, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2008, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. CSG Systems International, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, CSG Systems International, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets
of CSG Systems International, Inc. as of December31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2008, and
our report dated March 3, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. KPMG LLP Denver, Colorado March 3, 2009

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General CSG Systems International, Inc. the
Company, CSG, or forms of the pronoun we, a Delaware corporation, was formed in October 1994 and is based in Englewood, Colorado. We are a customer interaction management company that provides outsourced
solutions to allow our clients to better attract, manage, retain, and support their customers. Our heritage is providing these solutions to the North American cable and Direct Broadcast satellite DBS communications markets, which
represents a large percentage of our total revenues. Our solutions also support an increasing number of other industries such as financial services, utilities, telecommunications, healthcare, and home security. Our combination of solutions,
services, and expertise ensure that our clients can rapidly launch new product offerings, improve operational efficiencies, and deliver high-quality customer service in a competitive and ever-changing marketplace. We are a SP SmallCap 600
company. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Principles of Consolidation. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include all of our accounts and our subsidiaries accounts. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. Use of Estimates in Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the accompanying Consolidated
Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The more critical estimates and related
assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations are in the areas of: irevenue recognition; iiallowance for doubtful accounts receivable; iiiimpairment assessments of goodwill and other long-lived
assets; ivincome taxes; and vbusiness combinations and asset purchases. Revenue Recognition. We use various
judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenues to be recognized in each accounting period. Our primary revenue recognition criteria include: ipersuasive evidence of an arrangement; iidelivery;
iiifixed or determinable fees; and ivcollectibility of fees. In addition, for multiple-element arrangements that are not subject to a higher level of authoritative literature, we follow the guidelines of the Financial Accounting
Standards Boards FASB Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No. 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables EITF 00-21. For those revenue arrangements within the scope of EITF No. 00-21, we are required to evaluate all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether
they represent separate units of accounting. If the deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting, the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their relative fair values, and applicable revenue
recognition criteria are considered for the separate units of accounting. If the deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting, the consideration allocable to delivered items is combined with the consideration allocable to the
undelivered items, and the appropriate recognition of revenue is then determined for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. For the processing agreements that we have historically evaluated under EITF No. 00-21, we have
generally concluded that the deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting, and thus have treated the deliverables as a single unit of accounting, with the revenue recognized ratably over the term of the processing agreement.
We have historically derived a significant percentage of our total revenues from processing and related services. Processing and related
services revenues consist primarily of monthly processing fees generated from our outsourced customer care and billing application, called ACP, and services ancillary to ACP, and generally, 
55 Table of Contents
are not subject to various judgments and estimates in determining the proper revenue recognition. Processing and related services revenues are recognized as
the services are performed. Processing fees are typically billed monthly based on the number of clients customers served, ancillary services are typically billed on a per transaction basis, and customized print and mail services and other
customer interaction services are billed on a usage basis. Fees received to convert client customers onto our outsourced customer care and billing applications and fees received to set-up/implement new services for existing clients as well as the
costs to perform the conversion or set-up services are generally deferred and recognized over the term of the clients processing arrangement. Our historical revenues related to software licenses, maintenance services also known as post-contract customer support, or PCS and professional services are substantially less than those generated from processing
and related services. Software and maintenance revenues consist of the sale of software licenses principally one-time perpetual licenses and related software maintenance services. Professional services revenues consist of a variety of consulting
services, such as product installation, business consulting, and training services. A substantial percentage of the total combined revenues from these three sources comes from maintenance services. Software license fees are recognized using the guidelines of: iAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants AICPA Statement
of Position SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended SOP 97-2; iiSOP 98-9, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain Transactions SOP 98-9; and
iiiAICPA Technical Questions and Answers, Section5100, Revenue Recognition. For software arrangements that have multiple elements, such as software, maintenance and professional services, we allocate the contract value to
the respective elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE of their individual fair values, determined in accordance with SOP 97-2. VSOE of fair value for maintenance services is established by pricing the maintenance
services based upon a substantive maintenance renewal rate expressed as a consistent percentage of the stipulated license fees. For those software arrangements that have multiple elements for which we do not have VSOE of fair value on one or more of
the delivered elements, we allocate the contract value to the respective elements based upon the residual method in accordance with SOP 98-9. Under the residual method, the undiscounted fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred
and subsequently recognized as they are delivered. Our software arrangements generally do not include implementation services that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software being licensed. For certain software arrangements, we have agreed to host the software on our hardware. In accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-03,
Application of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Arrangements That Include the Right to Use Software Stored on Another Entitys Hardware, these hosting services are treated as a separate element of the software arrangement when
the client has a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is feasible for the client to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with
another party unrelated to us to host the software. Maintenance fees are recognized ratably over the service period. Our maintenance
services consist primarily of client and product support, technical updates e.g., bug fixes, etc., and unspecified upgrades or enhancements. If specified upgrades or enhancements are offered in an arrangement, which is rare, they are accounted for
as a separate element in accordance with SOP 97-2. Revenues from professional services generally consist of software installation projects
with a relatively short duration period. These revenues are generally recognized as the installation work is completed. Deferred
Revenue and Unbilled Accounts Receivable. Client payments and billed amounts due from clients in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue recognized prior to the scheduled billing date is recorded as unbilled
accounts receivable. Deferred revenue as of December31, 2008 and 2007 relates primarily to our processing and related services, of which a substantial portion relates to fees received to set-up/implement new services for our existing
clients customers which are being recognized over the term of the clients processing arrangements. 
56 Table of Contents
Postage. We pass through to our clients the cost of postage that is incurred on behalf of those
clients, and typically require an advance payment on expected postage costs. These advance payments are included in client deposits in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are classified as current liabilities regardless of
the contract period. We net the cost of postage against the postage reimbursements, and include the net amount in processing and related services revenues. We have concluded that net treatment of these revenues is appropriate as we:
igenerally have little or no credit risk with regard to postage, as we require postage deposits from our clients based on contractual arrangements prior to the mailing of customer statements; iihave no discretion over the supplier of
postal delivery services; and iiiare not the primary obligor in the postal delivery service. The cost of postage that has been shown net of the postage reimbursements from our clients for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $2518 million, $2137
million, and $1924 million, respectively. Pronouncements Adopted. Effective January 1, 2008 we adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In
addition, effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 SFAS 159, which permits an entity to
choose to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, we did not elect to measure any additional assets or
liabilities at fair value. Cash and Cash Equivalents. We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. As of December31, 2008, our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and institutional money market funds. Short-term Investments and Other Financial Instruments. Our financial instruments as of December31, 2008 and 2007 include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, and long-term debt. Because of their short maturities, the carrying amounts of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their fair value. Our short-term investments are considered available-for-sale in accordance with SFAS No115, Accounting for Certain Investments
in Debt and Equity Securities, and thus are reported at fair value in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, with unrealized gains and losses, net of the related income tax effect, excluded from earnings and reported in a separate
component of stockholders equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses were not material in any period presented. Our short-term
investments at December31, 2008 and 2007 consisted of the following in thousands:  As of December31 2008

Securities see Note 6. We have chosen not to measure our Convertible Debt Securities at fair value under SFAS 159, with changes recognized in earnings each reporting period. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value of our Convertible
Debt Securities, based upon quoted market prices or recent sales activity, was approximately $173 million and $201 million, respectively. The fair value of the contingent interest feature of our long-term debt, considered an embedded derivative, as
of December31, 2008 and 2007, was approximately $61,000 and $32,000, respectively. Concentrations of Credit Risk. In the
normal course of business, we are exposed to credit risk. The principal concentrations of credit risk relate to cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivable. We regularly monitor credit risk exposures and take
steps to mitigate the likelihood of these exposures resulting in a loss. We hold our cash deposits, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with financial institutions we believe to be of sound financial condition. We do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. We evaluate the credit worthiness of our clients in conjunction with our
revenue recognition processes, as well as through our ongoing collectibility assessment processes for accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific clients,
historical trends, and other information. We use various judgments and estimates in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. See Note 4 for additional details of our concentration of accounts receivable.
The activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is as follows in thousands:  2008 2007 2006 Balance, beginning of year 1,487 1,143 1,324 Additions to expense 1,527 231 109 Write-offs 88 54 381 Other 73 167 91 Balance, end of year 2,999 1,487 1,143 Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are recorded at cost or at estimated fair
value if acquired in a business combination and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term. Depreciation
expense is primarily computed using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation 
58 Table of Contents
expense for all property and equipment is reflected in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income separately in the aggregate and is not included in
the cost of revenues or the other components of operating expenses. Depreciation for income tax purposes is computed using accelerated methods. Software. We expend substantial amounts on research and development RD, particularly for new products and services, or for enhancements of existing products and services. For development of software products that
are to be licensed by us, we follow SFAS No86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed SFAS 86. SFAS 86 requires that the cost of developing software be expensed prior
to establishing technological feasibility, and those costs be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established. Capitalization ceases upon general release of the software. For development of software to be used internally e.g.,
processing systems software, we follow SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. SOP 98-1 requires that the cost of developing software for internal use be
expensed prior to the application development stage. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, we expended $673 million, $583 million, and $462
million, respectively, on RD projects. We did not capitalize any RD costs under SFAS 86 or SOP 98-1 in 2008, 2007, or 2006 as the costs subject to capitalization during these periods were not material. We did not have any capitalized
RD costs included in our December31, 2008 or 2007 accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realizability of Long-Lived
Assets. We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets, other than goodwill, in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are required to be
evaluated for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is impaired if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with that
asset are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. If deemed impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value. Goodwill. We follow the provisions of SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142 in accounting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. Under SFAS 142,
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, and is required to be evaluated for possible impairment on a more periodic basis e.g., quarterly if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment
may have occurred. Goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit which includes the goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Loss Contingencies. We follow the guidelines of SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies in determining the appropriate
accounting and disclosures for our loss and gain contingencies. We accrue for a loss contingency when: iit is probable that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred; and iithe amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. The determination of accounting for loss contingencies is subject to various judgments and estimates. We do not record the benefit from a gain contingency until the benefit is realized. Earnings Per Common Share EPS. EPS has been computed in accordance with SFAS No128, Earnings Per Share. Basic EPS
is computed by dividing net income the numerator by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period the denominator. Diluted EPS is consistent with the calculation of basic EPS while considering the effect of
potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Unvested shares of restricted stock are not included in the basic EPS calculation. Basic and diluted EPS are presented on the face of the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Income.

No reconciliation of the basic and diluted EPS numerators is necessary as net income is used as the
numerators for all periods presented. The reconciliation of the EPS denominators is included in the following table in thousands:  2008

stock of 09million, 04million, and 03million, respectively, for 2008, 2007, and 2006, were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS as their effect was antidilutive. We calculate the potential dilutive effect of our Convertible Debt Securities using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock
method, we experience dilution related to the Convertible Debt Securities only in those quarterly periods in which our average stock price has exceeded the current effective conversion price of $2677 per share. As discussed in Note 6, the current
effective conversion price of $2677 per share may be adjusted in the future for certain events, to include stock dividends, stock splits/reverse splits, the issuance of warrants to purchase our stock at a price below the then-current market price,
cash dividends, and certain purchases by us of our common stock pursuant to a self-tender offer or exchange offer. Refer to the
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective section below for a discussion of our adoption of FSP EITF 03-6-1, effective January1, 2009, and the corresponding retrospective impacts of such adoption on our EPS.
Stock-Based Compensation. Effective January1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share-Based
Payment SFAS 123R and related amendments and interpretations, using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS 123R establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or
services. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entitys equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity
instruments. SFAS 123R requires us to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures in calculating compensation costs for all outstanding awards. SFAS 123R requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense be reported
as a financing cash inflow rather than as an operating cash inflow. Income Taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and
liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We record net deferred tax
assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future
taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation
FIN No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109,
Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. FIN 48 
60 Table of Contents
provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon
examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of
FIN 48 and in subsequent periods. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized reductions in our liability for
unrecognized income tax benefits related to our continuing operations of $03 million and related to our discontinued operations of $12 million, both which were accounted for as an increase to our January1, 2007 accumulated earnings balance.
Comprehensive Income. The components of comprehensive income are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders Equity. Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Effective. SFAS No. 141 revised
2007Business Combinations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 revised 2007, Business Combinations SFAS 141R, which significantly changes the accounting for business combinations. Under SFAS 141R, an
acquiring entity is required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions. SFAS 141R further changes the accounting treatment for certain items, including:
iacquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred; iinoncontrolling interests formerly known as minority interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; iiiacquired contingent liabilities
will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies; ivcontingent consideration will be valued
at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved; vin-process research and development IPRD will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived
intangible asset at the acquisition date, treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment, and upon completion, the IPRD asset will be amortized over its useful life; virestructuring costs associated with
a business combination will be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and viichanges in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS
141R also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements. The provisions of SFAS 141R are effective for us for all
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January1, 2009. Since there is no retrospective application of this accounting pronouncement to prior reporting periods, only the accounting for future business combinations,
if any, will be impacted. FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash
upon Conversion Including Partial Cash Settlement. In May 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FSP APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash upon Conversion Including Partial
Cash Settlement. This FSP clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement, which would include our Convertible Debt Securities, are not addressed by paragraph 12 of
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants, and requires that instruments within its scope be separated into their liability and equity
components at initial recognition by: irecording the liability component at the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component; and iiattributing the remaining proceeds from the issuance to the
equity component. FSP APB 14-1 also requires that the original issue discount OID on the liability component of instruments within its scope be amortized using the interest method over the expected life of a similar liability that does
not have an associated equity component considering the effects of prepayment features other than the conversion option. The new model
for accounting for convertible debt instruments under FSP APB 14-1 is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented and is first applicable to our consolidated financial statements that

will be included in our March31, 2009 Form 10-Q. Relevant balance sheet and income statement information related to the adoption of this new accounting
pronouncement are provided below in thousands: Impact on Consolidated Balance Sheet:  As ofDecember31,2008 As ofDecember31,2007 At IssueDateJune2004 Convertible Debt Securities outstanding par value 200,300 230,000 230,000 OID 24,500 38,100 67,600 Convertible Debt Securities, net of unamortized OID 175,800 191,900 162,400 Impact on Consolidated Statement of Income:  2008

seven years, commencing on the date of issuance. The overall effective interest rate for our convertible debt securities will be 8% annually, which consists of the cash coupon rate of 25%, plus the impact of the OID amortization using the effective
interest rate method of amortization. As discussed in Note 6, during 2008 we repurchased $297 million par value of our Convertible Debt
Securities for $224 million, and recognized a gain on repurchase of $70 million. Upon adoption of FSP APB 14-1, the gain on repurchase recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be adjusted downward. The adoption of FSP APB 14-1 will not have an impact on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the recognition of the additional interest expense
will be a non-cash expense. FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are
Participating Securities. In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP EITF 03-6-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities. This FSP provides guidance on the calculation of
earnings per share under SFAS No128, Earnings per Share for share-based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Under the FSPs guidance, unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to SFAS 128s two-class method. Since the unvested
restricted stock awards under our stock incentive plans, granted prior to August 2008, contain nonforfeitable rights to cash dividends, we have concluded that this FSP impacts how we have historically calculated our earnings per share. FSP EITF
03-6-1 is effective for our consolidated financial statements that will be included in our March31, 2009 Form 10-Q, and all prior period earnings per share data presented will have to be adjusted retroactively including interim financial
statements, summaries of earnings, and selected financial data to conform with the provisions of this FSP. The implementation of the FSP
is estimated to reduce our historically reported basic and diluted earnings per share, before factoring in the impact of our January1, 2009 implementation of FSP APB 14-1 as discussed above, by approximately 2 to 5 percent. In August 2008, we
revised our standard forms of restricted stock award agreement, removing the nonforfeitable rights to dividends provision. All unvested restricted stock awards granted under these revised forms of agreement will not be considered participating
securities. As a result, the impact of this FSP on our future basic and diluted earnings per share will decline over time.

3. Acquisitions 2008 Acquisitions. DataProse, Inc. On April30, 2008, we acquired DataProse, Inc., DataProse for
a total cash purchase price of $405 million. DataProse was a privately-held provider of statement presentment and direct mail services headquartered in Oxnard, California, assisting over 500 clients across the United States to market through
improved billing statements and personalized direct mail. We acquired DataProse to further our objective of helping our clients maximize every customer interaction by both strengthening and broadening our portfolio of output solutions capabilities.
Additionally, this acquisition rounded out our national print and mail footprint and allowed us to diversify our client base into the utilities, financial services, and telecommunications markets, and added clients in the non-profit sectors of
healthcare and higher education. Quaero Corporation. On December31, 2008, we acquired Quaero Corporation Quaero
for a cash purchase price of $122 million. In addition to this initial cash purchase price, the Quaero merger agreement includes provisions for contingent purchase price payments of up to $95 million through the end of 2010, contingent upon the
achievement of certain predetermined operating criteria. As of December31, 2008, the additional purchase price payments have not been reflected in the Quaero purchase price due to uncertainty of payment. The contingent payments will be
recorded as additional purchase price if and when the events associated with the contingencies are resolved or the outcome of the contingencies are determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. Quaero is a marketing services provider with expertise in customer strategy, analytics, and marketing performance management headquartered in Charlotte,
North Carolina. We acquired Quaero to enhance our offerings with powerful customer intelligence capabilities, which when combined with our existing offerings such as our output solutions, interactive messaging, and e-communications, provides for a
combined strategic marketing solution to be offered to both our existing client base and Quaeros client base. The Quaero acquisition will also extend our reach into new industry verticals and further diversify our revenue base including
financial services, pharmaceutical/healthcare, media/publishing, travel/hospitality, consumer, and high tech. The application of the
purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The following table summarizes the estimated fair
values in thousands of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of acquisition for DataProse and Quaero, and the estimated lives of the acquired intangible assets. Amortization expense related to these acquired intangible assets is
recognized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the acquired intangible assets are expected to be received.  DataProse

63 Table of Contents
The DataProse and Quaero goodwill amounts represent the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over
the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and have been assigned to our one reportable segment. The DataProse and Quaero goodwill and acquired intangible assets are deductible for income tax purposes. DataProse has
differing values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed for book and tax purposes, and we have recognized deferred tax liabilities of $09 million related to that difference. In addition, DataProse has a value assigned to goodwill
for tax purposes that is greater than the value assigned to goodwill for book purposes by approximately $23 million. As required by SFAS 109, we have not recognized a deferred income tax asset related to that difference. Instead, we will recognize
the tax benefit related to the tax-over-book basis difference when the tax benefit is realized on the tax return, and that tax benefit will be applied to reduce the DataProse goodwill. The results of operations of DataProse is included in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the period subsequent to the acquisition
date. Quaero was acquired on December31, 2008, and thus, there are no results of operations of Quaero included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the twelve months ended December31, 2008. We are in the process of obtaining certain information that we believe is necessary to finalize the DataProse and Quaero purchase accounting, including
the finalization of: ithe valuation of the Quaero acquired customer relationships and other intangible assets; iia closing Quaero balance sheet audit which may result in a working capital adjustment, and thus an adjustment of the
total purchase price; iiithe valuation of Quaero other acquired assets and assumed liabilities; and ivthe income tax attributes of the acquired assets for both DataProse and Quaero. As of December31, 2008, we are not expecting
the working capital adjustment for Quaero to be material and are not expecting significant changes to our preliminary purchase price allocations for DataProse and Quaero. Prior Year Acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Prairie Voice Services, Inc., which we subsequently
renamed Prairie Interactive Messaging, Inc. Prairie, for a total cash purchase price of $466 million to date, which includes recorded contingent purchase price amounts of approximately $2 million as of December31, 2008. As of
December31, 2008, there remains approximately $4 million of additional contingent purchase price that is eligible for payment upon the achievement of certain operating criteria in 2009. This additional contingent purchase price has not been
recorded as contingent purchase price payment as of December31, 2008 because of the uncertainty of payment at that time, and will be recorded as additional purchase price if and when the events associated with the remaining contingencies are
resolved or the outcomes of the contingencies are determinable beyond a reasonable doubt. We acquired Prairie to extend our customer interaction management capabilities within our core cable television and DBS markets, while also providing an
established customer base in new industry verticals such as financial services and telecommunications. In 2007, we acquired ComTec, Inc.
ComTec for a total cash purchase price of $249 million. We acquired ComTec to maximize customer interaction for clients by expanding our statement processing footprint and capabilities through the addition of enhanced statement
production and electronic statement presentation hardware and software technologies, as well as for additional plant capacities. In addition, the acquisition increases our presence in our core video market, as well as in new industry verticals such
as telecommunications, home security, healthcare, financial services, and utilities. In 2006, we acquired Telution, Inc.
Telution for a total cash purchase price of $304 million, which includes recorded contingent purchase price payments of $80 million as of December31, 2008. We acquired Telution and its COMX solution to expand our ability to
support communication providers as they deliver advanced and IP-based services. Pro forma information on our historical results of
operations to reflect the acquisitions of ComTec, Prairie, DataProse and Quaero is not presented as the acquisitions results of operations during prior periods, individually and in the aggregate, are not material to our results of operations.

4. Segment Reporting and Significant Concentration Segment Information. Segment and related information is presented in accordance with SFAS No131, Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information SFAS 131. SFAS 131 requires disclosures of selected information about operating segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. SFAS 131
requires operating segments to be determined based on the way management organizes a company for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance. Based on the guidelines of SFAS 131, we have determined that as of December31,
2008, we have one reportable segment. Products and Services. Our primary product offerings include our core outsourced processing
product, ACP, and related services and software products, to include our output solutions. We generate a substantial percentage of our total revenues by providing ACP processing and output services and related software products to the North American
cable and DBS markets. We license certain software products e.g., ACSR, Workforce Express, etc. and provide professional services principally to our existing base of processing clients to enhance the core functionality of ACP, increase the
efficiency and productivity of our clients operations, and allow clients to effectively roll out new products and services to new and existing markets, such as HSI, and telephony services. Our full suite of processing, software, and
professional services allows clients to maximize the value and minimize the costs associated with their customer interactions by using our solutions to conduct key business processes such as targeting prospective customers, rolling out and offering
new products quickly, efficiently managing order processing, streamlining operations, managing field workforces, improving customer satisfaction, integrating actionable customer intelligence, developing marketing strategies, printing and mailing
monthly statements, and electronically transacting with customers. Geographic Regions. All revenues and long-lived assets are
attributable to our operations in North America, primarily the U.S. General Market Conditions. In recent months, the U.S. has
experienced a significant economic downturn and difficulties within the financial and credit markets, and these adverse economic conditions are predicted to continue into the foreseeable future. The possible adverse impacts to companies during these
times include a reduction in revenues, decreasing profits and cash flows, distressed or default debt conditions, and/or difficulties in obtaining necessary operating capital. Because of the severity and the far-reaching impacts of the situation, all
companies could be adversely affected by the current economic conditions to a certain degree, including us, our clients, and/or key vendors in our supply chain. Significant Clients and Industry Concentration. The North American communications industry has experienced significant consolidation over the last few years, resulting in a large percentage of the market being
served by a limited number of service providers with greater size and scale. Consistent with this market concentration, a large percentage of our revenues are generated from a limited number of clients, with approximately two-thirds of our revenues
being generated from our four largest clients, which are Comcast Corporation Comcast, DISH Network Corporation DISH, Time Warner Inc. Time Warner, and Charter Communications, Inc. Charter.
Revenues from these clients represented the following percentages of our total revenues for the following years:  2008 2007 2006 Comcast
27 27 24 DISH
18 20 19 Time Warner
14 13 12 Charter

As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the percentage of net billed accounts receivable balances
attributable to these clients were as follows:  AsofDecember31 2008 2007 Comcast
30 32 DISH
17 22 Time Warner
14 11 Charter
10 9 We expect to continue to generate a significant percentage of our future revenues from a limited
number of clients, including Comcast, DISH, Time Warner, and Charter. There are inherent risks whenever a large percentage of total revenues are concentrated with a limited number of clients. One such risk is that, should a significant client:
iterminate or fail to renew its contract with us, in whole or in part, for any reason; iisignificantly reduce the number of customer accounts processed on our systems, the price paid for our services, or the scope of services we
provide; or iiiexperience significant financial or operating difficulties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. On February12, 2009, Charter publicly announced a restructuring plan that included the following key points:  Charter had reached an agreement-in-principle with an ad hoc committee of certain of its debt holders on the terms of a financial restructuring to reduce
Charters debt by approximately $8 billion on certain outstanding senior notes.  Under the terms of the agreement, Charter intends to implement its financial restructuring through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing to be initiated on or before
April1, 2009.  The purpose of Charters financial restructuring is to strengthen its balance sheet in order to fully support the companys operations and service its
debt. As such, the agreement-in-principle contemplates paying trade creditors in full.  The agreement-in-principle is subject to numerous closing conditions and there is no assurance that the treatment of creditors outlined in Charters public
statements will not change significantly. Companies involved in bankruptcy proceedings pose greater financial risks to
us, consisting principally of the following: ia financial loss related to possible claims of preferential payments for certain amounts paid to us prior to the bankruptcy filing date, as well as increased collectibility risk for accounts
receivable, particularly those accounts receivable that relate to periods prior to the bankruptcy filing date; and/or iithe possibility of a contract being unilaterally rejected as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, or a client in
bankruptcy may attempt to renegotiate more favorable terms as a result of their deteriorated financial condition, thus, negatively impacting our rights to future revenues subsequent to the bankruptcy filing. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $12 million of accounts receivable due from Charter, none of which had a specific allowance for doubtful
accounts receivable amount established against it. The entire amount of this accounts receivable balance was collected in the normal course in 2009, and we believe that Charters history of timely paying our invoices significantly reduces our
preferential payment risk related to our 2008 Consolidated Financial Statements if Charter was indeed to declare bankruptcy as noted in their February12, 2009 public announcement.

goodwill acquired in 2007 is related to the ComTec and Prairie business acquisitions. The adjustments related to prior acquisitions made in 2008 is primarily due to the recording of contingent purchase price payments of $49 million for the Telution
and Prairie acquisitions. Other Intangible Assets. Our intangible assets subject to ongoing amortization consist of client
contracts and software. Client Contracts Client contracts consist of: iinvestments in client contracts; iidirect and incremental costs that we have capitalized related to contractual arrangements where we have deferred revenues to convert or set-up client customers
onto our outsourced solutions; and iiiclient contracts acquired in business combinations. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying values of these assets were as follows in thousands:  2008

Investments in client contracts are principally incentives provided to new or existing clients to convert their customer accounts to, or retain their customers accounts on,
our customer care and billing systems. Investments in client contracts related to client incentives are amortized ratably over the lives of the respective client contracts, which as of December31, 2008, have termination dates that range from
2011 through 2016. Amortization of the investments in client contracts related to client incentives is reflected as a reduction in processing and related services revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 2
Client contracts related to the deferral of conversion/set-up services costs are amortized proportionately over the same period that the deferred conversion/set-up services revenues
are recognized, and are primarily reflected in cost of processing and related services in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. 3
Acquired client contracts represent assets acquired in the Quaero, DataProse, Prairie, ComTec, and Telution business acquisitions. Acquired client contracts are being amortized over
their estimated useful lives ranging from ten months to twenty years. Amortization related to the DataProse, Prairie, and ComTec acquired client contracts is primarily reflected in cost of processing and related services in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income, while amortization related to the Telution acquired client contracts is primarily reflected in cost of software, maintenance and services revenues in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.
The weighted-average remaining amortization period of client contracts as of December31, 2008 was approximately 64
months. Based on the December31, 2008 net carrying value of these intangible assets, the estimated amortization for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December31 will be: 2009$82 million; 2010$77 million;
2011$68 million; 2012$60 million; and 2013$20 million. Software Software consists primarily of software and similar intellectual property rights from the Quaero, DataProse, Prairie, ComTec, and Telution business
acquisitions, and to a much lesser degree, internal use software. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying values of these assets were as follows in thousands:  2008

as of December 31, 2008 was approximately 57 months. Based on the December31, 2008 net carrying value of these intangible assets, the estimated
amortization for each of the five succeeding fiscal years ending December31 will be: 2009 $25 million; 2010$24 million; 2011$24 million; 2012$21 million; and 2013$04 million. 6. Debt Our debt at December31 consists of the
following in thousands:  2008
2007
Senior subordinated convertible contingent debt securities, due June15, 2024, first put back date June 15, 2011, interest at
250 200,300 230,000
2004 Revolving Credit Facility, due September 2009, interest at base rate or adjusted LIBOR, plus applicable margin 200,300 230,000
Less-current portion Long-term debt, net of current maturities 200,300 230,000 Convertible Debt Securities. On June2, 2004, we completed an offering of $2300
million of 25% senior subordinated convertible contingent debt securities due June15, 2024 the Convertible Debt Securities to qualified buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933. The Convertible Debt Securities are unsecured, subordinated to any of our future senior debt, and senior to our future junior subordinated debt. The
Convertible Debt Securities, issued at a price of 100% of their par value, bear interest at a rate of 25%per annum, which is payable semiannually in arrears on June15 and December15 of each year. The Convertible Debt Securities
are callable by us for cash, on or after June20, 2011, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the par value of the Convertible Debt Securities, plus accrued interest. The Convertible Debt Securities can be put back to us by the holders for
cash at June15, 2011, 2016 and 2021, or upon a change of control, as defined in the Convertible Debt Securities bond indenture Bond Indenture, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the par value of the Convertible Debt
Securities, plus any accrued interest. Commencing with the six-month period beginning June15, 2011, we will pay contingent interest
equal to 025% of the average trading price of the Convertible Debt Securities during any six-month period if the average trading price of the Convertible Debt Securities for the five consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day
immediately preceding the first day of the six-month period equals 120% or more of the par value of the Convertible Debt Securities. The
Convertible Debt Securities are convertible into our common stock, under the specified conditions and settlement terms outlined below, at an initial conversion rate of 373552 shares per $1,000 par value of Convertible Debt Securities, which is
equal to an effective conversion price of $2677 per share. The Bond Indenture includes anti-dilution provisions for the holders such that the conversion rate and thus, the effective conversion price can be adjusted in the future for certain
events, to include stock dividends, stock splits/reverse splits, the issuance of warrants to purchase our stock at a price below the then-current market price, cash dividends, and certain purchases by us of our common stock pursuant to a self-tender
offer or exchange offer. Holders of the Convertible Debt Securities can convert their securities: iat any time the price of our
common stock trades over $3480 per share 130% of the $2677 effective conversion price for a specified period of time; iiat any time the trading price of the Convertible Debt Securities fall below 98% of the average conversion value for
the Convertible Debt Securities for a specified period of time; iiiupon us exercising our right to redeem the Convertible Debt Securities at any time after June20, 2011; ivat any time upon the occurrence of specified corporate
transactions, to include a change in control as defined in the Bond Indenture; 
69 Table of Contents
and vif a certain level of dividends are declared, or a certain number of shares of our common stock are repurchased under a self-tender offer by us.
As of December31, 2008, none of the contingent conversion features have been achieved, and thus, the Convertible Debt Securities are not convertible by the holders. Upon conversion of the Convertible Debt Securities, we will settle our conversion obligation as follows: iwe will pay cash for 100% of the $2003 million par value of the Convertible Debt Securities; and
iito the extent our conversion obligation exceeds the par value, we will satisfy the remaining conversion obligation in our common stock, cash or any combination of our common stock and cash. The fair value of the Convertible Debt Securities as of December31, 2008 and 2007 based upon quoted market prices or trade activity at year-end,
was approximately $173 million and $201 million, respectively. The contingent interest feature of the Convertible Debt Securities discussed above is considered an embedded derivative that is required to be bifurcated and accounted for as a
freestanding derivative financial instrument. The fair value of this derivative financial instrument, as of December31, 2008 and 2007, was $61,000 and $32,000, respectively. During 2008, we repurchased $297 million par value of our Convertible Debt Securities for $224 million in the open public market, and recognized a
gain on the repurchase of $70 million, after the write-off of a proportional amount of deferred financing costs. This debt has been considered extinguished for accounting purposes. 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. On September21, 2004, we entered into a five-year, $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility
the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of U.S. financial institutions. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by our capital stock and the capital stock of all of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries,
and 65% of the capital stock of all our future foreign subsidiaries, if any. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility has a $40 million sub-facility for standby and commercial letters of credit and a $10 million sub-facility for same day advances provided
solely by the U.S. financial institution where we maintain our operating cash accounts. The 2004 Revolving Credit Facility requires
maintenance of certain financial ratios, including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. In addition, the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to certain limitations, including: ithe incurrence of certain indebtedness and
liens on our property; iithe execution of contracts that represent certain fundamental changes in our business; iiithe sale of our property except in the ordinary course of business; ivthe making of certain restricted
payments, as defined to include cash dividends; and vthe making of investments, as defined. As of December31, 2008, we were in compliance with the financial ratios and other covenants of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, and due to
an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit of $05 million, had $995 million of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility contractually available. However, one of the financial institutions, which is responsible for funding approximately 15% of the
facility, has undergone recent financial challenges and it is unknown at this time whether those challenges would affect the financial institutions ability or willingness to fund the facility if drawn upon. If that financial institution is
unable or unwilling to fund its portion of the facility, as of December 31, 2008, we would have only $845 million of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility available to us. The interest rate for borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility, except for same day advances, is chosen at our option and is based upon a base rate or adjusted LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin. The
base rate represents the higher of a floating prime rate and a floating rate equal to 50 basis points in excess of the Federal Funds Effective Rate. The interest rate for same day advances is based upon base rate, plus an applicable margin. The
applicable margins are dependent on our leverage ratio, as defined, and range from zero to 100 basis points for base rate loans and 125 to 225 basis points for LIBOR loans. As of December31, 2008, we had made no borrowings under the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. We pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion
of the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee rate is dependent on our leverage ratio and ranges from 25 to 50 basis points per annum. As of December31, 2008, the commitment fee rate was 375 basis points per annum.

Deferred Financing Costs. As of December31, 2008, net deferred financing costs related to
the Convertible Debt Securities were $22 million, and are being amortized to interest expense through the first date the holders of the Convertible Debt Securities can be put back to us June 15, 2011, or approximately seven years from the date of
issuance. As of December31, 2008, net deferred financing costs related to the 2004 Revolving Credit Facility were $01 million, and are being amortized to interest expense over the five-year term of the credit agreement. The net deferred
financing costs are reflected in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense for 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes amortization of deferred financing costs of $12 million. The weighted-average interest rate on our
debt borrowings, including amortization of deferred financing costs and commitment fees on the revolving credit facility, for 2008, 2007, and 2006, was 32%. 7. Income Taxes Income Tax Provision. Our continuing operations income is from North American sources, principally
the U.S. The income tax provision related to continuing operations consists of the following in thousands:  2008
2007
2006
Current Federal 14,159 17,309 20,407
State 1,801 1,845 2,031 15,960 19,154 22,438 Deferred Federal 15,426 10,722 14,809

and our financial statement income tax related to continuing operations is summarized as follows in thousands:  2008 2007 2006 Provision at Federal rate of 35 32,862 32,712 35,339 State income taxes, net of Federal impact 1,858 3,423 2,075 Compensation disallowance 33 589 2,186 Other 2,309 2,248 1,192 Total income tax provision 32,444 33,298 38,408 We are required to estimate our income tax liability in each jurisdiction in which we operate,
including both Federal and state income taxes. Various judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provisions for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are certain transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate income tax determination may be uncertain. In addition, we may be subject to examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities, which could result in adverse outcomes. For these reasons, we
establish a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This liability is adjusted based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the
expiration of a statute of limitations or the refinement of an estimate. 
71 Table of Contents
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in
thousands:  2008 2007 Balance, beginning of year 4,534 4,363 Additions based on tax positions related to current year 1,019 1,092 Additions for tax positions of prior years 23 73 Reductions for tax positions of prior years 22 105 Lapse of statute of limitations 882 889 Balance, end of year 4,672 4,534 We recognize income tax related interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. In addition
to the $47 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December31, 2008, we had $04 million of income tax-related accrued interest. Included in the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits are $18 million and $15 million,
respectively, related to our discontinued operations. If recognized, the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits related to our continuing operations, or $32 million, would affect our continuing operations effective tax rate.
We file income tax returns primarily in the U.S. Federal jurisdiction and in various state jurisdictions. As of December31, 2008,
the U.S. Federal statute of limitations has expired for years prior to 2005, and the statute of limitations has expired in our major state jurisdictions of Nebraska, Colorado and Florida for years prior to 2005, 2004, and 2005, respectively.
Deferred Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the expected utilization of tax net operating loss NOL
carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Net deferred income tax assets as of December31
are attributable to the following in thousands:  2008 2007 Current deferred income tax assets Accrued expenses and reserves 9,050 7,632 Stock-based compensation 3,705 3,025 12,755 10,657 Non-current deferred income tax assets liabilities Purchased research and development 10,845 14,204 Software 1,058 782 Client contracts and related intangibles 2,749 3,177 Noncompete agreements 714 1,223 Net operating loss NOL carryforwards 7,348 12,453 Property and equipment 8,910 3,278 Contingent interest related to Convertible Debt Securities 27,744 22,745 Deferred revenue 3,849 3,705 Contingent payments 886 882 Other 131 614 11,190 9,453 Valuation allowance Net deferred income tax assets 1,565 20,110

We regularly assess the likelihood of the future realization of our net deferred income tax assets. To
the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that a deferred income tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established. As of December31, 2008, we believe that between: icarryback opportunities to past
periods with taxable income; and iisufficient taxable income to be generated in the future, we will realize the benefit of our net deferred income tax assets. As of December31, 2008 we have: ian acquired Federal NOL carryforward of $167 million, which will begin to expire in 2020 and can be utilized through 2027; and iistate NOL carryforwards of $239
million, which will expire beginning in 2009 and ending in 2023. The acquired Federal NOL carryforward is attributable to the pre-acquisition periods of acquired subsidiaries. The annual utilization of this Federal NOL carryforward is limited
pursuant to Section382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our Convertible Debt Securities are subject to special U.S.
Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. These regulations allow us to take a tax deduction for interest expense on our U.S. Federal income tax return at a constant rate of 909% subject to certain adjustments,
compounded semi-annually, which represents the estimated yield on comparable non-contingent, non-convertible, fixed-rate debt instruments with terms and conditions otherwise similar to the Convertible Debt Securities. This interest expense tax
deduction is greater than the interest expense reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. This is considered a temporary difference, and thus does not impact our overall effective income tax rate. As a result, we will be
building a deferred tax liability until the Convertible Debt Securities are settled. Upon settlement, if the holders are able to achieve or exceed the 909% target yield on the Convertible Debt Securities, the cumulative deferred tax liability will
be reclassified to stockholders equity. If the holders are not able to achieve the 909% target yield, we will be required to pay the portion of the cumulative deferred tax liability to the U.S. tax authorities without interest or penalties
determined by comparing the actual yield and the target yield, with the amount of the cumulative deferred tax liability not paid to the U.S. tax authorities reclassified to stockholders equity. 8. Discontinued Operations In December 2005, we
closed on agreements to sell: iour Global Software Services business the GSS Business to Comverse, Inc., a division of Comverse Technology, Inc. Comverse; and iiour plaNet Consulting business the
plaNet Business to a group of private investors led by the plaNet management team. The GSS Business and plaNet Business both
met the definition of a component of an entity and thus were accounted for as discontinued operations under SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. As a result, we have reflected the
results of operations for the GSS Business and plaNet Business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. We have not segregated cash flows between continuing operations and
discontinued operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As deemed appropriate, our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements focus on our continuing operations. During the third quarter of 2006, we made a $6 million payment to Comverse related to the settlement of a dispute over a joint tax election associated
with the sale of the GSS Business. This payment to Comverse is considered a reduction in the purchase price previously paid by Comverse, and thus is reflected as part of the loss from discontinued operations for 2006. This settlement payment had not
been anticipated by us, and we do not expect any similar purchase price adjustments in future periods. Discontinued operations activity
during 2007 and 2008 were not significant.

9. Employee Retirement Benefit Plans Defined Contribution-Type Plan. We sponsor a defined contribution plan covering substantially all of our employees. Participants may contribute up to 25% of their annual wages, subject to certain limitations,
as pretax, salary deferral contributions. We make certain matching, and at our discretion, service-based contributions to the plan. The expense related to matching and service-related contributions for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $62 million, $61
million, and $49 million, respectively. Deferred Compensation Plan. We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain
executives which allows the participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation. We provide a 25% matching contribution of the participants deferral, up to a maximum contribution of $6,250 per year, plus a positive or negative return
on the deferred account balance attributable to the individual participants. As of December31, 2008 and 2007, we have recorded a liability for this obligation of $41 million and $52 million, respectively. The expense benefit for this plan
for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $16 million, $06 million, and $08 million, respectively. The plan is unfunded. 10. Commitments, Guarantees and
Contingencies Operating Leases. We lease certain office and production facilities under operating leases that run through 2020.
The leases generally are renewable and provide for the payment of real estate taxes and certain other occupancy expenses. In addition, we lease certain operating equipment under operating leases that run through 2012. Future aggregate minimum lease
payments under these facilities and operating equipment agreements are as follows: 2009$100 million, 2010$91 million, 2011$76 million, 2012$57 million, 2013$47 million, and thereafter$102 million. We
sublease portions of certain office facilities that we have abandoned. The total minimum lease payments to be received in the future under signed noncancelable subleases as of December31, 2008 totaled $04 million. Total rent expense for 2008,
2007, and 2006, was $113 million, $92 million, and $83 million, respectively. Service Agreements. We outsource to First Data
Corporation FDC the data processing and related computer services required for the operation of our processing services and certain related products. The ACP proprietary software is run in FDCs facility to obtain the necessary
mainframe computer capacity and other computer support services without us having to make the substantial capital and infrastructure investments that would be necessary for us to provide these services internally. Our clients are connected to the
FDC facility through a combination of private and commercially-provided networks. We also contract with FDC for computer floor space on which we maintain certain open systems hardware, used primarily to support ACP related products and internal
administrative systems. Under our contract with FDC, which expires in June 2010, we are charged a fixed fee plus a variable fee based on usage and/or actual costs. The total amount paid under the FDC service agreement for 2008, 2007, and 2006 was
$483 million, $459 million, and $426 million, respectively. In December 2008, we entered into an agreement with Infocrossing LLC, a
Wipro Limited company Infocrossing to transition the data processing and related computer services from FDC to Infocrossing prior to the expiration of the FDC contract term. The term of the Infocrossing agreement is five years
beginning on the date of full conversion. Product and Services Warranties. We generally warrant that our products and related
offerings will conform to published specifications, or to specifications provided in an individual client arrangement, as applicable. The typical product warranty period is 90 days from delivery of the product or offering. For certain service
offerings we provide a limited warranty for the duration of the services provided. We generally warrant that services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner. The typical remedy for breach of warranty is to correct or replace any
defective deliverable, and if not possible or practical, we will accept the return of the defective deliverable and refund the amount paid under the client arrangement that is allocable to the defective deliverable. Our contracts also generally
contain limitation of damages provisions in an effort to reduce our exposure to monetary damages arising from breach of warranty claims. Historically, we have incurred minimal warranty costs, and as a result, do not maintain a warranty reserve.
74 Table of Contents
Product and Services Indemnifications. Our arrangements with our clients generally include an
indemnification provision that will indemnify and defend a client in actions brought against the client that claim our products and/or services infringe upon a copyright, trade secret, or valid patent. Historically, we have not incurred any
significant costs related to such indemnification claims, and as a result, do not maintain a reserve for such exposure. Claims for
Company Non-performance. Our arrangements with our clients typically cap our liability for breach to a specified amount of the direct damages incurred by the client resulting from the breach. From time-to-time, these arrangements may also
include provisions for possible liquidated damages or other financial remedies for our non-performance, or in the case of certain of our outsourced customer care and billing solutions, provisions for damages related to service level performance
requirements. The service level performance requirements typically relate to system availability and timeliness of service delivery. As of December31, 2008, we believe we have adequate reserves, based on our historical experience, to cover any
reasonably anticipated exposure as a result of our nonperformance for any past or current arrangements with our clients. The amount of the reserve maintained for this purpose is not material. Indemnifications Related to Sold Businesses. In conjunction with the sale of the GSS business in December 2005, we provided certain
indemnifications to the buyer of this business which are considered routine in nature such as employee, tax, or litigation matters that occurred while these businesses were under our ownership. Under the provisions of this indemnification
agreement, payment by us is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures in the indemnification agreement, and we are typically allowed to challenge the other partys claims. In addition, certain of our obligations
under this indemnification agreement are limited in terms of time and/or amounts, and in some cases, we may have recourse against a third party if we are required to make certain indemnification payments. We estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at $28 million as of the closing date for the sale of the GSS business. Since the sale of the GSS
business, we have made an indemnification payment of $01 million, and as of December31, 2008, the indemnification liability was $23 million and related principally to indemnifications related to income tax matters. It is not possible to
predict the maximum potential amount of future payments we may be required to make under this indemnification agreement due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances associated with each indemnification
provision. We believe that if we were required to make payments in excess of the indemnification liability we have recorded, the resulting loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. If any amounts
required to be paid by us would differ from the amounts initially recorded as indemnification liabilities as of the closing dates for the sale of the GSS business, the difference would be reflected in the discontinued operations section of our
Consolidated Statements of Income. Indemnifications Related to Officers and the Board of Directors. We have agreed to indemnify
certain of our officers and members of our Board of Directors if they are named or threatened to be named as a party to any proceeding by reason of the fact that they acted in such capacity. We maintain directors and officers DO
insurance coverage to protect against such losses. We have not historically incurred any losses related to these types of indemnifications, and are not aware of any pending or threatened actions or claims against any officer or member of our Board
of Directors. As a result, we have not recorded any liabilities related to such indemnifications as of December31, 2008. In addition, as a result of the insurance policy coverage, we believe these indemnification agreements are not significant
to our results of operations. Legal Proceedings. From time-to-time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of
our operations in the normal course of business. We are not presently a party to any material pending or threatened legal proceedings.

11. Stockholders Equity We currently have a stock repurchase program, approved by our Board of Directors, authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock from time-to-time as market and business conditions warrant the Stock
Repurchase Program. During the fourth quarter of 2008, our Board of Directors approved a five million share increase in the number of shares we are authorized to repurchase under the Stock Repurchase Program, bringing the total number of
authorized shares to 35 million. As of December31, 2008, a summary of the shares repurchased under the Stock Repurchase Program is
as follows in thousands, except per share amounts:  2008

As of December31, 2008, the total remaining number of shares available for repurchase under
the Stock Repurchase Program totaled approximately 6million shares. In addition to the above mentioned stock repurchases, during
2008, 2007, and 2006, we repurchased and then cancelled approximately 136,000 shares, 176,000 shares, and 148,000 shares for $18 million, $40 million, and $37 million, respectively, of common stock from our employees in connection with minimum
tax withholding requirements resulting from the vesting of restricted stock under our stock incentive plans. 12. Equity Compensation Plans
Stock Incentive Plans Background. Beginning in 2003, we began primarily granting restricted stock awards instead of stock options to employees and non-employee directors under our equity compensation plans. Restricted stock awards offer employees and
non-employee directors the opportunity to earn shares of our common stock over time or upon the attainment of pre-established performance objectives, rather than stock options in which the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a set price
is earned over time. Restricted stock awards have historically been granted at no cost to the recipient. Because of the greater intrinsic value of the restricted stock at the grant date when compared to stock options, the number of equity awards
granted under this compensation methodology is less than the number of equity awards granted when the primary equity awards were stock options. Summary of Stock Incentive Plans. As of December31, 2008, we have four stock incentive plans, as summarized below:  Plan

The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan the 2005 Plan was adopted upon stockholder approval. The 2005 Plan replaced the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the
1996 Plan. No further grants may be made under 
76 Table of Contents 
the 1996 Plan, but any stock awards outstanding under the 1996 Plan remain in effect in accordance with their respective terms. The shares available under
the 2005 Plan have been reserved for issuance to officers and other key employees of our company and its subsidiaries and to non-employee directors of our company in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards,
restricted stock awards, or stock bonus awards. Shares granted under the 2005 Plan in the form of a performance unit award, restricted stock award or stock bonus award are counted toward the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for
issuance under the 2005 Plan as two shares for every one share granted or issued in payment of such award. 2
The Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors the 1997 Director Plan was adopted upon stockholder approval. During 2006, the 1997 Director Plan terminated with
respect to future grants, but any stock awards outstanding under the 1997 Director Plan remain in effect in accordance with their respective terms. 3
The 2001 Stock Incentive Plan the 2001 Plan was adopted without stockholder approval. The shares available under the 2001 Plan have been reserved for issuance to
eligible employees of our company in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance unit awards, restricted stock awards, or stock bonus awards. Shares available under the 2001 Plan may be granted to key employees of our company
or its subsidiaries who are not: iofficers or directors; iicovered employees for purposes of Section162m of the Internal Revenue Code; or iiipersons subject to Section16 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Modifications to Stock-Based Awards. In December 2007, we entered into a separation agreement with our
then Chief Executive Officer and President which included a provision that accelerated vesting of 102,500 shares of unvested restricted stock. The adjustment to stock-based compensation expense as a result of this modification was not significant.
Restricted Stock. We generally issue new shares versus treasury shares to fulfill restricted stock award grants. Historically,
our restricted stock awards have vested annually over four years with no restrictions other than the passage of time i.e., the shares are released upon calendar vesting with no further restrictions Time-Based Awards. Unvested
Time-Based Awards are typically forfeited and cancelled upon termination of employment with our company. Certain Time-Based Awards become fully vested upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment.
The fair value of the Time-Based Awards determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Beginning in 2007, we began issuing restricted stock shares to key members of management primarily members of executive management that vest in equal
installments over three years upon meeting either pre-established financial performance objectives or pre-established stock price objectives Performance-Based Awards. The structure of the performance goals for the Performance-Based
Awards were approved by the stockholders at our May 2007 annual meeting. The Performance-Based Awards become fully vested upon a change in control, as defined, and the subsequent involuntary termination of employment. The fair value of the
Performance-Based Awards determined by using the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date is charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the
award is, in-substance, multiple awards.

1,614,569 1817 The weighted-average grant date fair value of restricted stock shares granted during 2008, 2007,
and 2006, was $1222 per share, $2508 per share, and $2315 per share, respectively. The total market value of restricted stock shares vesting during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $57 million, $117 million, and $102 million, respectively. 
Stock Options. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of the grant.
Stock option awards typically vest over four years and have a maximum term of ten years. As discussed above, during 2003, we began primarily granting restricted stock awards instead of stock options to employees and non-employee directors. No stock
options were awarded during 2008, 2007, or 2006. A summary of our stock option activity during 2008 is as follows:  2008

The aggregate intrinsic value represents stock options that were in-the-money as of December31, 2008, and is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the
underlying awards and the closing market price of our common stock as of December31, 2008. The aggregate intrinsic
value of stock options exercised, determined as of the date of option exercise, during 2008, 2007, and 2006 was approximately $23,000, $08 million, and 96million, respectively. Cash received from stock option exercises during 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $01 million, $11 million, and $107 million, respectively. 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan As of December31, 2008, we had an employee stock purchase plan whereby 958,043 shares of our common stock have been reserved for sale to our
employees through payroll deductions. The price for shares purchased under the plan is 85% of market value on the last day of the purchase period. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, 90,728, 57,339, and 40,570 shares, respectively, were purchased under the
plan for $11 million, $937 to $1607 per share, $11 million, $1251 to $2363 per share, and $09 million $1868 to $2357 per share, respectively. As of December31, 2008, 234,448 shares remain eligible for purchase under the plan.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense We recorded stock-based compensation expense of $116 million, $111 million, and $122 million, respectively, for 2008, 2007, and 2006. As of
December31, 2008, there was $197 million of total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized. That cost, excluding the impact of forfeitures, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 23 years.
We recorded a deferred income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense during 2008, 2007, and 2006, of $44 million, $41
million, and $37 million, respectively. The actual income tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock for 2008, 2007, and 2006, totaled $22 million, $48 million, and $49 million,
respectively. 13.

The fourth quarter of 2008 results of operations include a gain of $70 million, or $014 per diluted share, related to the repurchase of $297 million of our Convertible Debt
Securities see Note 6. 3
The increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2007 was primarily the result of the acquisitions of the ComTec and Prairie businesses in July and August 2007, respectively see
Note 3. The increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of 2007 was primarily the result of the full quarter impact of the ComTec and Prairie business acquisitions and organic growth factors. 4
When compared to previous quarters, the fourth quarter of 2007 results of operations include $13 million of additional operating expenses related to the retirement of our former
CEO on December28, 2007. These additional operating expenses, net of certain income tax benefits resulting from the timing of our former CEOs retirement, reduced our income from continuing operations by approximately $001 per diluted
share.
