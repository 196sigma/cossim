To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. a Delaware corporation and
Subsidiaries listed in the index on page 31 of this Form 10-K. These financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, as of December 31, 1997,
the Company has net monetary assets of $60,000,000 at ICN Yugoslavia which would
be subject to foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of the Yugoslavian dinar
were to occur.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule
referred to above, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information required to be included therein. s/ COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1997 1. ORGANIZATION AND BACKGROUND
ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company was formed in
November 1994, as a result of the merger of ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ICN,
SPI  Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. SPI,  Viratek,  Inc. Viratek and ICN
Biomedicals, Inc. Biomedicals collectively, the Predecessor Companies,
in a transaction accounted for using the purchase method of accounting the
Merger. The Company is a multinational pharmaceutical company that develops,
manufactures, distributes and sells pharmaceutical, research, and diagnostic
products and provides radiation monitoring services. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and all of its majority-owned subsidiaries.
Investments in 20% through 50% owned affiliated companies are included under the
equity method where the Company exercises significant influence over operating
and financial affairs. Investments in less than 20% owned companies are recorded
at cost. The accompanying  consolidated financial statements reflect the
elimination of all significant intercompany account balances and transactions.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 1997 and
1996 includes $22,221,000 and $28,687,000, respectively, of certificates of
deposit which have maturities of three months or less. For purposes of the
consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company considers highly-liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. The carrying amount of these assets approximates fair value due to
the short-term maturity of these instruments.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES: In 1995, the Company classified its investment in
corporate bond securities, with maturities ranging from 1999 to 2003, as
available for sale. Changes in market values were reflected as unrealized gains
and losses, calculated on the specific identification method, in stockholders'
equity. The contractual maturity value of these securities was $26,700,000.
During 1996, the Company sold $26,663,000 of corporate bond securities for a
total of $26,952,000 resulting in a realized gain of $289,000.
INVENTORIES: Inventories, which include material, direct labor and factory
overhead, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a
first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
The Company primarily uses the straight-line method for depreciating property,
plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Buildings and related
improvements are depreciated from 7-50 years, machinery and equipment from 3-30
years, furniture and fixtures from 3-15 years and leasehold improvements and
capital leases are amortized over their useful lives, limited to the life of the
related lease.
The Company follows the policy of capitalizing expenditures that materially
increase the lives of the related assets and charges maintenance and repairs to
expense. Upon sale or retirement, the costs and related accumulated depreciation
or amortization are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting
gain or loss is included in income.
The Company capitalizes interest on borrowed funds during construction periods
as part of the cost of the related asset. Page 38

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES: The difference between the purchase price and the fair
value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition is included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets as goodwill and intangibles. Intangible
assets also include  acquired  product rights.  Goodwill and intangibles
amortization periods range from 5 to 23 years depending upon the nature of the
business or products acquired. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1997 and
1996 was $18,145,000 and $14,945,000, respectively. The Company periodically
evaluates the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles including the related
amortization periods. The Company determines whether there has been impairment
by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the
acquired entity or product line with the carrying value of the goodwill. Based
on its review, the Company does not believe that any impairment of its goodwill
and intangibles has occurred.
NOTES PAYABLE: The Company classifies various borrowings with initial terms of
one year or less as notes payable. The weighted average interest rate on
short-term  borrowings  outstanding  at December  31, 1997 and 1996 was
approximately 18% and 17%, respectively.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenues and related cost of sales are recorded at the time
of shipment or as services are performed.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The assets and liabilities of the Company
foreign operations,  except those in highly inflationary economies,  are
translated at the end of period exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The
effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency
assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars are accumulated in stockholders'
equity. The monetary assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries in highly
inflationary economies are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the end of period
exchange rates and non-monetary assets and liabilities at historical exchange
rates. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 52, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, the Company has included in earnings all
foreign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions and
the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on subsidiaries operating in
highly inflationary economies. The recorded gains losses from foreign exchange
translation and transactions for 1997, 1996 and 1995, were $12,790,000 2,282,000 and $9,484,000, respectively.
INCOME TAXES: Income taxes are calculated in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach
that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the
Company financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is
established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS No. 109
generally considers all expected future events other than an enactment of
changes in the tax law or rates.
USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
PER SHARE INFORMATION: In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 128, EARNINGS PER SHARE. SFAS No. 128 replaced the calculation of
primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and diluted earnings per
share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic earnings per share excludes any
dilutive effects of options, warrants, and convertible securities. Diluted
earnings per share is similar to the previously reported fully diluted earnings
per share. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 128 in 1997, and earnings per share
amounts for all periods prior to 1997 have been restated to comply with its
requirements.
During 1997, the Company Board of Directors  declared  quarterly cash
distributions and dividends for each quarter, totaling $213 per share. During
1996, the Company Board of Directors declared quarterly cash distributions for
the first, second and third quarters totaling $154 per share. For the fourth
quarter of 1996, the Company Board of Directors declared a cash distribution
of $051 per share in January 1997. page 39

DECEMBER 31, 1997 STOCK SPLIT AND STOCK DISTRIBUTIONS: In February 1998, the Company Board of
Directors approved a three-for-two stock split in the form of a dividend which
became effective March 16, 1998. In addition, during 1995, the Company issued
quarterly stock distributions which totaled 56%. Common share and per common
share amounts for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the stock
split and the stock distributions.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions
of SFAS No. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. SFAS No. 123 defines a
fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option. Fair value
of the stock option is determined considering factors such as the exercise
price, the expected life of the option, the current price of the underlying
stock and its volatility, expected dividends on the stock, and the risk-free
interest rate for the expected term of the option. Under the fair value based
method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value
of the award and is recognized over the service period. Pro forma disclosures
for entities that elect to continue to measure compensation cost under the
intrinsic value method provided by Accounting Principles Board No. 25 must
include the effects of all awards granted in fiscal years that begin after
December 15, 1994.
RECLASSIFICATIONS: Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform
with the current year presentation, with no effect on previously reported net
income or stockholders' equity. 3. ACQUISITIONS

DECEMBER 31, 1997
ACQUIRED PRODUCT RIGHTS - Effective July 1, 1997, the Company purchased the
worldwide rights to seven products and the non-U.S. rights to two other products
with an option to purchase the U.S. rights to these products from F.
Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Roche, for aggregate consideration of $90,000,000.
The consideration was paid in a combination of 2,400,000 shares of the Company
common stock, valued at $40,000,000, and 2,000 shares of the Company Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock, valued at $50,000,000 together, the Roche
Shares. Each share of the Company Series C Convertible Preferred Stock was
convertible into 1,500 shares of the Company common stock. In conjunction with
the issuance of the Roche Shares, the Company guaranteed Roche a price initially
at $1717 per common share, increasing at a rate of 6% per year for the
three-year guarantee period. Should Roche sell the common shares at any time
during the guarantee period, the agreement entitled the Company to any of the
proceeds realized by Roche in excess of the guaranteed price. Effective October
1, 1997, as a result of the rise in the per share market price of the Company
common stock since the initial acquisition from Roche, the Company exercised its
option to acquire the U.S. rights to the two products noted above, plus two
other U.S. product rights, for aggregate consideration of $89,008,000, which was
paid with cash owed to the Company by Roche from the sale of the Roche Shares.
The aggregate cost of the acquired product rights of $183,193,000 including
acquisition costs is included in goodwill and intangibles in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 1997.
The following table presents unaudited  consolidated pro forma financial
information for the twelve months ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, as though

DECEMBER 31, 1997 The purchase price allocations are preliminary, pending completion of the
Company evaluation of the fair values of the net assets acquired.
HUMACAO PLANT - The Company also  purchased  from Roche a  GMP-standard
manufacturing plant in Humacao, Puerto Rico the Plant for $55,000,000. The
purchase of the Plant is under a sale/leaseback arrangement, whereby Roche will
lease the Plant from the Company under a two year lease with lease payments
totaling $4,000,000 annually. Approximately $6,000,000 of the purchase price was
offset against amounts due from Roche under the lease and related agreements,
and the remainder was paid in cash. Roche will continue to use the Plant for the
manufacture of pharmaceutical products during the term of the lease. The Company
also entered into a toll manufacturing agreement under which it will produce
pharmaceutical products for Roche for a one-year period after the expiration of
the lease.
VELEFARM - In October 1997, the Company acquired a 426% interest in Velefarm, a
major distributor of pharmaceutical products located in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
for an investment of approximately $13,224,000. Under the terms of the
agreement, the Company exchanged accounts receivable due from Velefarm as agent
for the Yugoslavian government for the 426% interest. ICN Yugoslavia recorded
sales to Velefarm of approximately $140,700,000 and $44,800,000 for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively,  of which approximately
$30,200,000 of 1997 sales were subsequent to the Company investment. The
Company investment in Velefarm has been recorded under the equity method of
accounting. 4.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In August 1996, the Company loaned the Chairman and CEO $428,000 in regards to
tax matters relating to the exercise of stock options. This loan along with
accrued interest was repaid in November 1996. In June 1996, the Company made a
short-term loan to the Chairman and CEO in the amount of $3,500,000 for certain
personal obligations. During August 1996, this amount was repaid to the Company.
In connection with this transaction, the Company guaranteed $3,600,000 of debt
of the Chairman with a third party bank. In addition to the guarantee, the
Company deposited $3,600,000 with this bank as collateral to the Chairman
debt. This deposit is recorded as a long-term asset on the consolidated balance
sheet. The Chairman has provided collateral to the Company guarantee in the
form of a right to the proceeds of the exercise of stock options in the amount
of 150,000 options with an exercise price of $1517 and the rights to a
$4,000,000 life insurance policy provided by the Company. In the event of any
default on the debt to the bank, the Company has recourse that is limited to the
collateral described above. Both the transaction and the sufficiency of the
collateral for the guarantee were approved by the Board of Directors.
In 1997, the Company made a short-term advance of $327,000 to the Chairman and
CEO, which was repaid, with interest, in 1997. 5. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of
credit risk, as defined by SFAS No. 105, consist primarily of cash deposits and
marketable securities. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with
respected financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any
one financial institution. See also Note 14. At December 31, 1997, the
Company cash and cash equivalents include $178,536,000 held in time deposits,
money market funds, and municipal debt securities through seven major financial
institutions. Page 42

$  27,736   $  6,815  $   2,997
The current federal tax provision has not been reduced for the tax benefit
associated with the exercise of employee stock options of $-0-, $1,600,000, and
$1,300,000 in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, which were credited directly to
additional capital.
In connection with the Merger, the Company acquired approximately $226,000,000
of net operating loss carryforwards NOLs. Included in the total acquired
NOLs were $191,000,000 of domestic NOLs and $35,000,000 of foreign NOLs.
Internal Revenue Service Code Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the
availability of NOLs that can be used to reduce taxable income after certain
substantial ownership changes of a corporation. Consequently, the Company
annual limitation on utilization of the acquired domestic NOLs is approximately
$33,000,000 per year.
In addition to the utilization of the NOLs described above, the Company
recognized during 1995 a $27,000,000 tax benefit of an additional $76,000,000 of
acquired NOLs and other deferred tax assets through a reduction in the Company
deferred tax asset valuation allowance. This reduction resulted in a $24,000,000
reduction in goodwill and intangibles acquired in connection with the Merger and
a $3,000,000 reduction in deferred income tax expense. In 1997, the provision
for income taxes reflects a deferred tax benefit of $35,376,000 resulting from
the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and the reduction of the related
valuation allowance. During 1997, the Company acquired certain product rights
from Roche, and in early 1998 it acquired certain products from SmithKline
Beecham plc. These new products are expected to generate future taxable income
that provided a basis for reducing the Company valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets in 1997. Ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is
dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income prior to
expiration of the loss carryforwards. Although realization is not assured,
management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets
will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the future if estimates of future taxable income
during the carryforward period are reduced. page 43

During 1996, no U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes were provided on the
undistributed earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries with the exception
of the Company Panamanian subsidiary, Alpha Pharmaceuticals, since management
intends to reinvest those undistributed earnings in the foreign operations.
Included in  consolidated  retained  earnings at December 31, 1997,  is
approximately $290,000,000 of accumulated earnings of foreign operations that
would be subject to U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes, if and when
repatriated.
The Internal Revenue Service has concluded its examination of the Company tax
years ended November 30, 1991, 1990, 1989 and 1988, which resulted in a
reduction in net operating loss carryforwards of $13,000,000 pretax and a
corresponding decrease in the pretax valuation allowance. Page 44

DECEMBER 31, 1997 Income available to common stockholders, for purposes of computing basic
earnings per share, reflects adjustments for cumulative preferred dividends and
an embedded dividend arising from the discounted conversion terms of the Series
B Preferred Stock. The Company Series B Convertible preferred stock is not
reflected in the computation of diluted earnings per share as such securities
are antidilutive. As of December 31, 1997 the 2,249 outstanding shares of Series
B Preferred Stock are convertible into approximately 82,500 shares of the
Company common stock. All shares of the Company Series C Convertible
Preferred Stock, issued in July 1997, were converted into common stock during
1997 and the adjustment to the number of shares outstanding represents the
additional shares that would have been outstanding had the Series C Preferred
Stock been converted to common stock at the time of issuance. 8. DETAIL OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTS

payable, aggregating $32,727,000, under which borrowings of $10,598,000 were
outstanding at December 31, 1997. The lines of credit provide for short-term

payable quarterly. The Company has the option to pay the dividend in either cash
or common stock of the Company. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is
mandatorily convertible into common stock on the fifth anniversary of its
issuance. However, this provision is subject to extension under certain
circumstances. Dividends paid in common stock are based on the fair value of
common stock at the time of declaration. During 1997, 47,951 shares of the
Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into a total of 2,797,820
shares of the Company common stock. Page 49

11. COMMON STOCK
Prior to the Merger, each of the Predecessor Companies had their own stock
option plans. Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company assumed all options
outstanding under the existing stock option plans. The existing stock option
plans were exchanged for shares of the Company. Each option of SPI common stock,
ICN common stock, Viratek common stock and Biomedicals common stock was
exchanged for 15, 0768, 0749 and 0296 options of the Company common stock,
respectively. Subsequent to the Merger, no new grants are being issued under
these Plans.
The 1994 Stock Option Plan was adopted on January 26, 1995 and subsequently
approved by shareholders. This plan provides for the granting of options to
purchase a maximum of 4,854,000 shares of the Company common stock. Under the
plan each nonemployee director is granted 22,500 options on the day following
the annual meeting of stockholders.
Under the terms of all stock option plans, the option price may not be less than
the fair market value at the date of the grant and may not have a term exceeding
10 years. Option grants vest ratably over a four year period from the date of
the grant. The options granted are reserved for issuance to officers, directors,
key employees, scientific advisors and consultants. The Company has adopted the
disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no compensation cost
has been recognized for the stock option plans. Had compensation cost for the
Company stock option plans been determined based on the fair value at the
grant date for awards in 1997, 1996 and 1995 consistent with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, the Company net income and earnings per share would have been

Biomedicals in November 1994 and the issuance of convertible debentures in
connection therewith; and ii information provided to the public. Plaintiffs
also allege that the Chairman of the Company traded on inside information
relating to the 1994 hepatitis C NDA. The Securities Complaint asserts claims
for alleged violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933,
Sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder. Plaintiffs motion seeking the certification of i a
class of persons who purchased ICN securities from November 10, 1994 through
February 17, 1995; and ii a subclass consisting of persons who owned SPI
and/or Biomedicals common stock prior to the Merger was granted. On July 23,
1997, plaintiffs and defendants entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to Settle
Action, whereby the parties agreed to settle the 1995 Actions for $15,000,000 in
cash. The settlement was approved by the Court on February 24, 1998 and the case
is now at an end.
Four lawsuits have been filed with respect to the Merger in the Court of
Chancery in the State of Delaware the 1994 Actions. Three of these lawsuits
were filed by stockholders of SPI and, in one lawsuit, of Viratek against ICN,
SPI, Viratek in the one lawsuit and certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI
and/or Viratek including the Chairman and purport to be class actions on
behalf of all persons who held shares of SPI and Viratek common stock. The
fourth lawsuit was filed by a stockholder of Viratek against ICN, Viratek and
certain directors and officers of ICN, SPI and Viratek including the Chairman
and purports to be a class action on behalf of all persons who held shares of
Viratek common stock. These suits allege that the consideration provided to the
public stockholders of SPI and/or Viratek in the Merger was unfair and
inadequate, and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in approving
the Merger and otherwise. The 1994 Actions have been dormant since their
commencement, and it is expected that they will be dismissed as a result of the
settlement of the 1995 Actions. Page 52

DECEMBER 31, 1997 INVESTIGATIONS: Pursuant to an Order Directing Private Investigation and
Designating Officers to Take Testimony,  entitled In the Matter of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., P-177 the Order, a private investigation is being
conducted by the SEC with respect to certain matters pertaining to the status
and disposition of the 1994 hepatitis C NDA. As set forth in the Order, the
investigation concerns whether, during the period June 1994 through February
1995, the Company, persons or entities associated with it and others, in the
offer and sale or in connection with the purchase and sale of Company
securities, engaged in possible violations of Section 17a of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 10b of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5 thereunder, by having possibly: i made false or misleading statements or
omitted material facts with respect to the status and disposition of the 1994
hepatitis C NDA; or ii purchased or sold ICN common stock while in possession
of material, non-public information concerning the status and disposition of the
1994 hepatitis C NDA; or iii conveyed material, non-public information
concerning the status and disposition of the 1994 hepatitis C NDA, to other
persons who may have purchased or sold ICN stock. The Company has cooperated
with the Commission in its investigation. On January 13, 1998, the Company
received a letter from the SEC Philadelphia Office the District Office
stating the District Office intention to recommend to the Commission that it
authorize the institution of a civil action against the Company and Milan Panic.
As set forth in the letter, the District Office seeks the authority to commence
a civil action to enjoin the Company from future violations of Section 10b of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and to impose a civil penalty of up
to $500,000 on the Company. In regard to Mr. Panic, the District Office seeks
the authority to begin a civil action i to enjoin Mr. Panic from future
violations of Section 17a of the Securities Act, Section 10b of the Exchange
Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; ii for disgorgement of approximately $390,000;
iii for prejudgment interest; iv for a civil penalty pursuant to Section 21A
of the Exchange Act that cannot exceed three times any amount disgorged and v
for an officer and director bar pursuant to Section 21 of the Exchange Act. On
January 30, 1998, the Company and Mr. Panic filed submissions with the
Commission urging that it reject the District Office request.
The Company has received Subpoenas the Subpoenas from a Grand Jury in the
United States District Court, Central District of California requesting the
production of documents covering a broad range of matters over various time
periods. In March 1998, the Company was advised that the office of the United
States Attorney for the Central District of California, is considering the
Company, Mr. Panic and a former officer of the Company targets of the
investigation. The Company was also advised that certain current and former
officers of the Company are considered subjects of the investigation. The
Company has and continues to cooperate in the Grand Jury investigation. A number
of current and former employees of the Company have been interviewed by the
government in connection with the investigation.
The Company is a party to a number of other pending or threatened lawsuits. In
the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these other matters will
not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or liquidity.
PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE: The Company could be exposed to possible claims for
personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products. While to date no
material adverse claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective
products has been successfully maintained against the Company, a substantial
claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
BENEFITS PLANS: The Company has a defined contribution plan that provides all
U.S. employees the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation for
payout at a subsequent date. The Company can voluntarily make matching
contributions on behalf of participating and eligible employees. The Company
expense related to such defined contribution plan was not material in 1997, 1996
and 1995. Page 53

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
DECEMBER 31, 1997 In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed deferred compensation
agreements with certain officers and certain key employees of the Predecessor
Companies, with benefits commencing at death or retirement. As of December 31,
1997, the present value of the deferred compensation benefits to be paid has
been accrued in the amount of $2,894,000. Interest accrues on the outstanding
balance at rates ranging from 94% to 126%. No new contributions are being
made; however, interest continues to accrue on the present value of the benefits
expected to be paid.
ENVIRONMENTAL  ISSUES IN HUNGARY: In connection with the acquisition of
Alkaloida, an environmental remediation fund the Fund of approximately
$7,200,000 was established by the government from the proceeds that the Company
tendered. This Fund will be used to remediate a waste disposal site adjacent to
Alkaloida, contaminated by past plant operations, by 1998. In 1997, ownership of
waste disposal site was transferred to the Hungarian government and the Company
was released from all future liability associated with the site.
OTHER: Milan Panic, the Company Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer, is employed under a contract expiring December 31, 1998 that provides
for, among other things, certain health and retirement benefits. The contract is
automatically extended at the end of each year for successive one year periods
unless either the Company or Mr. Panic terminates the contract upon six months
prior written notice. Mr. Panic, at his option, may provide consulting services
upon his retirement for $120,000 per year for life, subject to annual
cost-of-living adjustments from the base year of 1967, and will be entitled when
serving as a consultant to participate in the Company medical and dental
plans. Including such cost-of-living adjustments, the annual cost of such
consulting services is currently estimated to be in excess of $535,000. The
consulting fee shall not at any time exceed the annual compensation as adjusted,
paid to Mr. Panic. Upon Mr. Panic retirement, the consulting fee shall not be
subject to further cost of living adjustments.
The Company has employment agreements with six key executives which contain
change in control benefits. Upon a change in control of the Company as
defined in the contract, the employee shall receive severance benefits equal to
three times salary and other benefits. 13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
The Company is a  multinational  pharmaceutical  company that  develops,
manufactures, distributes and sells pharmaceutical, research, and diagnostic
products and provides radiation monitoring services. The Company operates in two
business segments: the Pharmaceutical group and the Biomedical group. The
Pharmaceutical group produces and markets pharmaceutical products principally in
the United States, Mexico, Canada and Europe. The Biomedical group markets
research  products and related  services,  immunodiagnostic  reagents and
instrumentation, and provides radiation monitoring services.
The Company largest selling product, VirazoleR, accounts for approximately
3% of total Company sales for 1997 and is sold principally in the United States
for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus RSV in infants. In July
1995, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with a subsidiary of
Schering-Plough Corporation Schering-Plough to license VirazoleR as a
treatment for chronic hepatitis C in combination with alpha interferon. Under an
agreement,  Schering-Plough is responsible for all clinical  developments
worldwide.
The principal markets for the Company products are Yugoslavia, the United
States, and Russia, which represented approximately 30%, 22%, and 18% of the
Company net sales for 1997. Operations in Yugoslavia are subject to business
risks described in Note 14. Approximately 78%, 80%, and 75% of the Company net
sales for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995 were generated from
operations outside the U.S. Foreign operations are subject to certain risks
inherent in conducting business abroad, including possible nationalization or
expropriation, price and exchange controls, limitations on foreign participation
in local enterprises, health-care regulation and other restrictive governmental
actions. Changes in the relative values of currencies take place from time to
time and may materially affect the Company results of operations. Their
effects on the Company future operations are not predictable. The Company does
not currently provide a hedge on its foreign currency exposure and, in certain
countries in which the Company operates, no effective hedging program is
available. At December 31, 1997 the Company had net monetary asset positions in
Yugoslavia, Russia, and Mexico of approximately $60,000,000, $28,475,000, and
$6,719,000 which would be subject to a loss if a devaluation were to occur. Page 54

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: ICN Yugoslavia, a 75% owned subsidiary, operates in a
business environment that is subject to significant economic volatility and
political instability. The current trend in Yugoslavia is toward unfavorable
economic conditions that include continuing liquidity problems, inflationary
pressures, unemployment, a weakened banking system and a high trade deficit. The
future of the economic and political environment of Yugoslavia is uncertain and
could deteriorate to the point that a material adverse impact on the Company
financial position and results of operations could occur.
LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS: In an effort by the Central Bank of Yugoslavia to control
inflation through tight monetary controls, Yugoslavia is now experiencing severe
liquidity problems. This has resulted in longer collection periods for ICN
Yugoslavia receivables. Most of ICN Yugoslavia customers are slow to pay due
to delays of health care payments by the government. This has also resulted in
ICN Yugoslavia being unable to make timely payments on its payables. Under the
current credit terms with the Yugoslavian government, discussed below, the
government is obligated to pay a minimum of $9,500,000 per month on its
outstanding obligations to the Company. The credit arrangement also limits the
total receivable from the government to $200,000,000 which could limit sales in
the future to an amount equal to cash collections from the government. ICN
Yugoslavia holds approximately U.S. $19,731,000 of cash in a bank outside of
Yugoslavia, originally intended to be used for future plant expansion in
Yugoslavia. These funds may be available for working capital purposes if
necessary.
INFLATION AND MONETARY  EXPOSURE:  ICN Yugoslavia  operates in a highly
inflationary economy and uses the dollar as the functional currency rather than
the Yugoslavian dinar. Before the enactment of an economic stabilization program
in January 1994, the rate of inflation in Yugoslavia was over one billion
percent per year. The rate of inflation was dramatically reduced when, on
January 24, 1994, the Yugoslavian government enacted a Stabilization Program
designed to strengthen its currency.  Throughout 1994, this program was
successful in reducing inflation to approximately 5% per year, increasing the
availability of hard currency, stabilizing the exchange rate of the dinar, and
improving the overall economy in Yugoslavia.
Throughout 1995, the effectiveness of the Stabilization Program weakened and ICN
Yugoslavia began experiencing a decline in the availability of hard currency and
inflation levels accelerated to an approximate annual rate of 90% by the end of
the year. In expectation of a devaluation late in 1995, ICN Yugoslavia took
action early in the fourth quarter of 1995 to reduce its monetary exposure by
shortening the payment terms on its receivables, reducing sales levels,
accelerating the purchase of inventory and accelerating the purchase of building
materials for its plant expansion. On November 24, 1995, the dinar devalued from
a rate of 14 dinars per U.S. $1 to a rate of 47 dinars per U.S. $1. On this
date, ICN Yugoslavia had a net monetary liability position that resulted in a
gain of $8,724,000. Page 58
ICN PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
DECEMBER 31, 1997 Throughout 1996, the level of inflation in Yugoslavia was relatively stable,
with a Yugoslavian government reported inflation rate of 60%. During that time
the government exercised restraint on the amount of dinars in circulation. The
net monetary asset position of ICN Yugoslavia increased during 1996 due to
rising accounts  receivable  balances resulting from higher sales and a
lengthening of the accounts receivable collection period. From a beginning
balance of $7,396,000 at December 31, 1995, the net monetary asset position of
ICN Yugoslavia rose to $134,000,000 at December 31, 1996.
During 1997, the Company reduced its monetary exposure by converting certain
dinar-denominated accounts receivable into notes receivable payable in dinars,
but fixed in dollar amounts. Additionally, the Company established credit terms
with the government whereby future receivables would be interest bearing with
one-year terms and would be payable in dinars, but fixed in dollar amounts. As
of December 31, 1997, ICN Yugoslavia had a net monetary asset position of
$60,000,000 which would be subject to foreign exchange loss if a devaluation of
the dinar were to occur.
As required by generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, the Company
translates ICN Yugoslavia financial results at the dividend payment rate
established by the National Bank of Yugoslavia. To the extent that changes in
this rate lag behind the level of inflation, sales and expenses will, at times,
tend to be inflated. Future sales and expenses can increase substantially if the
timing of future devaluations falls significantly behind the level of inflation.
POTENTIAL DEVALUATION: The potential loss arising from a devaluation will depend
on the size of the devaluation and the magnitude of the net monetary asset
position at the time of the devaluation. The timing and the size of a
devaluation are strongly influenced by the amount of inflation and length of
time from the last devaluation. Since the last devaluation on November 24, 1995,
the cumulative level of inflation has been estimated at approximately 70%. If a
devaluation were to occur based on this level of inflation, and assuming the
Company net monetary exposure of $60,000,000 at December 31, 1997, the Company
could incur a foreign exchange loss of approximately $24,000,000. The risk of
devaluation increases as time passes and inflation continues. However, the
Company is unable to predict either the exact magnitude or the timing of any
future devaluation.
CREDIT RISK: ICN Yugoslavia is subject to credit risk in that approximately 80%
or $162,200,000 of 1997 Yugoslavian domestic sales are to the government or
government funded entities. During 1997, other than the customer discussed below
there were no other customers that represented more than 10% of total sales or
accounts receivable.
During 1997, the Company reduced its monetary exposure by converting dinar
denominated accounts receivable from various distributors into notes receivable
from the Yugoslavian government payable in dinars, but fixed in dollar amounts.
The first agreement was made early in the first quarter of 1997 with $50,000,000
accounts receivable converted into a one year note bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 1%. Approximately $47,000,000 from this first note was refinanced in early
1998, with full payment including interest at LIBOR plus 1% scheduled for 1998.
A second agreement was arranged at the end of the first quarter of 1997 whereby
the Yugoslavian government agreed to purchase $50,000,000 of drugs. The sales
under this agreement were recorded as notes receivable bearing interest at LIBOR
plus 1% on the outstanding balance which have payment guarantees fixed in dollar
amounts. The second agreement also allows the Company to offset certain payroll
tax obligations against outstanding accounts receivable balances. Subsequent to
these two agreements, the Company negotiated an arrangement with the Yugoslavian
government under which ICN Yugoslavia would commit to continue to provide
products, in dollar denominated sales, in an amount up to $50,000,000 per
calendar quarter for one year, and the government would pay a minimum of
$9,500,000 per month towards outstanding accounts receivable. However, at no
point in time can the amount due to ICN Yugoslavia from the government exceed
$200,000,000, including both accounts and notes receivable. Receivables that
arise from this agreement are interest bearing with interest at LIBOR plus 1%.
As of December 31, 1997, ICN Yugoslavia has approximately $145,431,000 of notes
receivable  from the  Yugoslavian  government  under these credit terms.
Additionally, sales of approximately $140,700,000 under the above agreements
were made to Velefarm, an affiliated entity, acting as agent for the Yugoslavian
government.
SANCTIONS AND POLITICS: In December 1995, the United Nations Security Council
adopted a resolution that suspended economic sanctions that had been imposed on
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since May 1992. A substantial majority of ICN
Yugoslavia business is conducted in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Page 59

DECEMBER 31, 1997
Sanctions had contributed to an overall deteriorating business environment in
which ICN Yugoslavia operated. Sanctions also created restrictions on ICN
Yugoslavia overseas investments and imposed  administrative  burdens in
obtaining raw materials outside of Yugoslavia.
The Company believes the suspension of sanctions continues to provide a more
favorable business  environment;  however, the beneficial effects of the
suspension will not take place immediately as the economy needs to adjust to new
opportunities.  Additionally,  Yugoslavia  has not  fully  recovered  the
international status it held before sanctions. The Yugoslavian government is
still negotiating to regain membership in the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
Yugoslavia is subject to political instability. The elections that took place in
1997 have not resulted in a change of political leadership that would provide
for a foundation of significant economic reforms. The Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is comprised of two states, Serbia and the much smaller state of
Montenegro. Within Yugoslavia there exists significant political dissension and
unrest. The state of Montenegro has been active in seeking greater autonomy from
Serbia. Additionally, recent social unrest in the Serbian province of Kosovo
could lead to increased instability in the Balkans. United States diplomats have
warned that the Serbian  actions and policies in Kosovo could lead to
reinstatement of economic sanctions on Yugoslavia.
PRICE CONTROLS: ICN Yugoslavia is subject to price controls in Yugoslavia. The
size and frequency of government approved price increases is influenced by local
inflation, devaluations, cost of imported raw materials and demand for ICN
Yugoslavia products. During 1997 and 1996, ICN Yugoslavia received no price
increases due to relatively lower levels of inflation. As inflation rises, the
size and frequency of price increases are expected to increase. During the third
quarter of 1995, ICN Yugoslavia  received a 30% price increase on its
pharmaceutical products. This was the first price increase the government had
allowed since the start of the Stabilization Program. Subsequent to the
devaluation on November 24, 1995, ICN Yugoslavia received an 80% price increase
on its pharmaceutical products. Price increases obtained by ICN Yugoslavia are
based on economic events preceding the price increase and not on expectations of
ongoing inflation. This lag in permitted price increases creates downward
pressure on the gross margins that ICN Yugoslavia receives on its products. When
necessary, ICN Yugoslavia will limit sales of products that have poor margins
until an acceptable price increase is received. The impact of an inability to
obtain adequate price increases in the future could have an adverse impact on
the Company as a result of declining gross profit margins or declining sales in
an effort to maintain existing gross margin levels.
DIVIDENDS: In 1992, ICN Yugoslavia paid a $10,000,000 dividend of which the
Company received 75% or $7,500,000. Yugoslavian law allows free distribution of
earnings whether to domestic Yugoslavian or international investors. Under
this law a dividend must be declared and paid immediately after year end.
Earnings that are not immediately paid as a dividend cannot be used for future
dividends. Additionally, ICN Yugoslavia is allowed to pay dividends out of
earnings calculated under local statutory tax basis rules, not earnings
calculated under GAAP. ICN Yugoslavia dividends are payable in dinars which must
be exchanged for dollars before the dividend is repatriated. During high levels
of inflation the dinar denominated dividend could devalue substantially by the
time the dividend is exchanged for dollars. Under GAAP, ICN Yugoslavia had
accumulated  earnings,  which are not  available for  distributions,  of
approximately  $207,384,000  at December  31, 1997.  However,  additional
repatriation of cash could be declared from contributed capital for Yugoslavian
purposes of $360,000,000 at December 31, 1997, as provided for in the original
purchase agreement. In 1992, the Company made the decision to no longer
repatriate the earnings of ICN Yugoslavia and instead will use these earnings
for local operations, plant expansion, reduction of debt and additional
investment in Eastern Europe. Page 60

DECEMBER 31, 1997 15. AGREEMENT WITH SCHERING-PLOUGH CORPORATION
On July 28, 1995, the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Supply
Agreement the Agreement and a Stock Purchase Agreement with a subsidiary of
Schering-Plough to license the Company proprietary antiviral drug ribavirin as
a treatment for chronic hepatitis C in combination with Schering-Plough alpha
interferon. The Agreement provided the Company an initial non-refundable payment
by Schering-Plough of $23,000,000 and future royalty payments to the Company for
marketing of the drug, including certain minimum royalty rates. Schering-Plough
will have exclusive marketing rights for ribavirin for hepatitis C worldwide,
except that the Company will retain the right to co-market in the countries of
the European Economic Community. In addition, Schering-Plough will purchase up
to $42,000,000 in common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain
regulatory milestones. Under the Agreement, Schering-Plough is responsible for
all clinical developments worldwide.
The $23,000,000 non-refundable payment has been recorded by the Company as
prepaid royalty income of $10,000,000, a license fee of $8,000,000 and a
liability to Schering-Plough for certain cost sharing agreements of $5,000,000.
The prepaid royalty will be amortized to income based upon future sales of the
product and the license fee will be amortized on a straight-line basis to income
over the fifteen year exclusive period of the Agreement. At December 31, 1997,
the unamortized portion of these balances totals $12,614,000.
16. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS DISCLOSURES

Titertek Instruments, Inc. Titertek, an Alabama corporation, in exchange for
a $4,400,000 note receivable from Titertek, resulting in a deferred gain of
$2,000,000 of which approximately $989,000 has been recognized at December 31,
1997. Noncash transactions for 1996 also included the issuance of common stock
for the acquisition of the Siemens dosimetry business 1,447,250 shares, the
Cappel Division of Organon Teknika Corporation 320,078 shares, and the
GlyDerm, Inc. dermatological business 216,000 shares. In addition, during 1996

DECEMBER 31, 1997 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In February 1998, the Company acquired from SmithKline Beecham plc SKB the

covering the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred
Stock. Page 62
