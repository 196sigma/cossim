Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Ultra Petroleum Corp. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Ultra Petroleum Corp. and subsidiaries as of December31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and retained earnings, shareholders equity and
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2005. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Ultra Petroleum Corp. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2005, in accordance
with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. As explained in Note1 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations, effective January1, 2003. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated March30, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on
managements assessment of, and an adverse opinion on the
effective operation of, internal control over financial
reporting.

See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. 49 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Expressed in U.S.dollars unless otherwise noted Years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS Ultra Petroleum Corp. the Company is an
independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition,
exploration, development, and production of oil and gas
properties. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the
Yukon Territory, Canada. The Companys principal business
activities are in the Green River Basin of southwest Wyoming and
Bohai Bay, China.   
1.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES aBasis of presentation and principles of
consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries UP
Energy Corporation, Ultra Resources, Inc. and Sino-American
Energy Corporation. The Company presents its financial
statements in accordance with U.S.Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles GAAP. All material
inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated
upon consolidation. bAccounting principles: The consolidated
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. cCash and cash equivalents: We consider all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. dRestricted cash: Restricted cash represents cash
received by the Company from production sold where the final
division of ownership of the production is unknown or in
dispute. Wyoming law requires that these funds be held in a
federally insured bank in Wyoming. eCapital assets: Capital assets are recorded at
cost and depreciated using the declining-balance method based on
a seven-year useful life. fOil and gas properties: The Company uses the
full cost method of accounting for exploration and development
activities as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
SEC. Separate cost centers are maintained for each
country in which the Company incurs costs. Under this method of
accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful,
exploration and development activities are capitalized as
properties and equipment. This includes any internal costs that
are directly related to exploration and development activities
but does not include any costs related to production, general
corporate overhead or similar activities. Effective with the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No143 in 2003, the carrying amount of
oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement
costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement
obligation when incurred. Gain or loss on the sale or other
disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized, unless
the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas
attributable to a country. The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future
development costs of oil and gas properties are amortized using
the units-of-production
method based on the proven reserves as determined by independent
petroleum engineers. Oil and gas reserves and production are
converted into equivalent units based on relative energy
content. Operating fees received related to the properties in
which the Company owns an interest are netted against expenses.
Fees received in excess of costs incurred are recorded as a
reduction to the full cost pool. Effective with the adoption of
SFASNo143, asset retirement obligations are
included in the base costs for calculating depletion. Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from
capitalized costs being amortized. These amounts represent
investments in unproved properties and major development
projects. The Company excludes these costs on a
country-by-country basis until proved reserves are found or
until it is determined that the costs are impaired. All costs
excluded are reviewed, at least quarterly, to determine if
impairment has 50 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued occurred. The amount of any impairment is transferred to the
capitalized costs being amortized the depreciation, depletion
and amortization DDA pool or a charge is
made against earnings for those international operations where a
reserve base has not yet been established. For international
operations where a reserve base has not yet been established, an
impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated
through evaluation of drilling results, relinquishing drilling
rights or other information. Companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil
and gas exploration and development activities are required to
perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter. The full cost
ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by SEC
RegulationS-X
Rule4-10. The ceiling test is performed quarterly on a
country-by-country basis. The ceiling limits such pooled costs
to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues
attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves
discounted at 10% plus the lower of cost or market value of
unproved properties less any associated tax effects. If such
capitalized costs exceed the ceiling, the Company will record a
write-down to the extent of such excess as a non-cash charge to
earnings. Any such write-down will reduce earnings in the period
of occurrence and result in lower DDA expense in future
periods. A write-down may not be reversed in future periods,
even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently
increase the ceiling. The effect of implementing
SFASNo143 had no effect on the ceiling test
calculation as the future cash outflows associated with settling
asset retirement obligations are excluded from this calculation. gInventories: Crude oil products and materials
and supplies inventories are carried at the lower of current
market value or cost. Inventory costs include expenditures and
other charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the
inventory to its existing condition and location and the Company
uses the weighted average method of recording its inventory.
Selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are
reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost.
Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or
less. Crude oil product inventory at December31, 2005 and
2004 includes depletion and lease operating expenses
LOE of $1,456,400 and $628,311, respectively,
associated with the Companys crude oil production in
China. Drilling and completion supplies inventory of
$206million primarily includes the cost of pipe that will
be utilized during the 2006 drilling program. hDerivative transactions: The Company has entered
into commodity price risk management transactions to manage its
exposure to natural gas price volatility. These transactions are
in the form of fixed price forward natural gas sales contracts
with financial institutions and other creditworthy
counterparties. These transactions have been designated by the
Company as cash flow hedges. As such, unrealized gains and
losses related to the change in fair market value of the
derivative contracts are recorded in other comprehensive income
in the balance sheet to the extent the hedges are effective. iIncome taxes: Income taxes are accounted for
under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
the period that includes the enactment date. jEarnings per share: Basic earnings per share is
computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stock
by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by
adjusting the average number of common shares outstanding for
the dilutive effect, if any, of common stock equivalents. The
Company uses the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive
effect. 51 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The following table provides a reconciliation of the components
of basic and diluted net income per common share for the years

kUse of estimates: Preparation of consolidated
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. lReclassifications: Certain amounts in the
financial statements of the prior years have been reclassified
to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. mAccounting for stock-based compensation:
SFASNo123 defines a fair value method of accounting
for employee stock options and similar equity instruments.
SFASNo123 allows for the continued measurement of
compensation cost for such plans see Note6 using the
intrinsic value based method prescribed by APB Opinion
No25 APB Opinion 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees, provided that pro forma results
of operations are disclosed for those options granted. The
Company accounts for stock options granted to employees and
directors of the Company under the intrinsic value method and no
compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of
options equals or is greater than the fair market value of the
underlying stock on the date of grant. Had the Company reported
compensation costs as 52 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value
of options is amortized to expense over the options
vesting period. The weighted-average fair value of each option
granted is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: at December31, 2005 expected volatility of
348% to 449% and a risk free rate of 418% to 441%; at
December31, 2004 expected volatility of 384% and a risk
free rate of 3713%; and at December31, 2003, expected
volatility of 250% and a risk free rate of 435%. At
December31, 2005 options have expected lives of
19years, at December31, 2004 options had expected
lives of 65years, and December31, 2003 options had
expected lives of 10years. At December31, 2005, all
stock options issued to date have fully vested. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFASNo123
revised 2004, or SFASNo123R, Share-Based Payment,
which replaces SFASNo123 and supersedes APB Opinion
25. SFASNo123R eliminates the option to use APB
Opinion 25s intrinsic value method of accounting and
requires recording expense for stock compensation based on a
fair value based method. After a phase-in period for
SFASNo123R, pro forma disclosure will no longer be
allowed. In the first quarter of 2005, the SEC issued Staff
Accounting BulletinNo107 which provided further
clarification on the implementation of SFASNo123R. Alternative phase-in methods are allowed under Statement
No123R and the Companys effective date for
implementation of SFASNo123R is January1,
2006. The Company expects it will use the modified-prospective
phase-in method that requires entities to recognize compensation
costs in financial statements issued after the date of adoption
for all share-based payments granted, modified or settled after
the date of adoption as well as for any awards that were granted
prior to the adoption date for which the required service has
not yet been performed. The Company does not believe that any of
the alternative phase-in methods would have a materially
different effect on the Companys Consolidated Statement of
Operations or Balance Sheet. nRevenue Recognition. Within the Companys
United States segment, natural gas revenues are recorded on the
entitlement method. Under the entitlement method, revenue is
recorded when title passes based on the Companys net
interest. The Company records its entitled share of revenues
based on estimated production volumes. Subsequently, these
estimated volumes are adjusted to reflect actual volumes that
are supported by third party pipeline statements or cash
receipts. Since there is a ready market for natural gas, the
Company sells the majority of its products soon after production
at various locations at which time title and 53 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued risk of loss pass to the buyer. Natural gas imbalances occur
when the Company sells more or less than its entitled ownership
percentage of total natural gas production. Any amount received
in excess of the Companys share is treated as a liability.
If the Company receives less than its entitled share, the
underproduction is recorded as a receivable. At
December31, 2005 the Company had a net natural gas
imbalance liability of $05million and at
December31, 2004, the Company had a net natural gas
imbalance receivable of $20million. In China, revenues are recognized when production is sold to a
purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has
occurred and title is transferred. oAccumulated Other Comprehensive Earnings Loss:
Other comprehensive earnings loss is a term used to define
revenues, expenses, gains and losses that under generally
accepted accounting principles are reported as separate
components of Shareholders Equity instead of net earnings
loss. The loss depicted on the balance sheet as other
comprehensive loss is associated with unrealized losses related
to the change in fair value of derivative instruments designated
as cash flow hedges.

pImpact of recently issued accounting
pronouncements: In December 2004, the FASB issued a revised
SFASNo123 SFAS123R.
SFAS123R requires compensation costs related to
share-based payments to be recognized in the income statement
over the vesting period. The amount of the compensation cost
will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the
instrument issued. SFAS123R is effective as of
January1, 2006, for all awards granted or modified after
that date and for those awards granted prior to that date that
have not vested. Beginning January1, 2006 the Company will
begin expensing share based compensation. All outstanding awards
issued prior to this date have fully vested. Stock compensation
expensed in 2005, 2004 and 2003 has been included within the
general and administrative line item of the Companys
income statement. For the years ended December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, stock compensation expense was $2,858,515 923,623 and $1,018,220, respectively. As of January1, 2006, the Company will be required to
adopt SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and SFAS
No3 SFAS No154. SFAS
No154 requires retrospective application of voluntary
changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable.
The Company does not expect this standard to have a material
impact on its financial statements.   
2.
ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS In June 2001, the FASB issued SFASNo143,
Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations
SFAS No143. SFAS No143 requires the
Company to record the fair value of an asset retirement
obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a
legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets that result from the acquisition,
construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. As of
December31, 2005, the Company has recorded a liability of
$3,601,348 $2,845,724 U.S. and $755,624 China to account for
future obligations associated with its assets in both the United
States and China. As of December31, 2004, the liability
was $744,512 $321,505 U.S. and $423,007 China. 54 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Bank indebtedness: The Company through its subsidiary
participates in a revolving credit facility with a group of
banks led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The agreement specifies
a maximum loan amount of $500million and an aggregate
borrowing base of $800million and a commitment amount of
$200million at November14, 2005. The commitment
amount may be increased up to the lesser of the borrowing base
amount or $500million at any time at the request of the
Company. Each bank shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to increase the amount of their commitment as requested by the
Company. In the event that the existing banks increase their
commitment to an amount less than the requested commitment
amount, then it would be necessary to bring additional banks
into the facility. At December31, 2005, the Company had no
amounts outstanding and $200million unused and available
under the current committed amount. 56 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The credit facility matures on May1, 2010. The note bears
interest at either Athe banks prime rate plus a
margin of zero percent 000% to three-quarters of one percent
075% based on the percentage of available credit drawn or at
BLIBOR plus a margin of one percent 100% to one and
three-quarters of one percent 175% based on the percentage of
available credit drawn. For the purposes of calculating
interest, the available credit is equal to the borrowing base.
An average annual commitment fee of 025% to 0375%, depending
on the percentage of available credit drawn, is charged
quarterly for any unused portion of the commitment amount. The
Companys total commitment fees were $354,017, $374,096 and
$249,788 for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. The borrowing base is subject to periodic at least semi-annual
review and re-determination by the banks and may be decreased or
increased depending on a number of factors, including the
Companys proved reserves and the banks forecast of
future oil and gas prices. If the borrowing base is reduced to
an amount less than the balance outstanding, the Company has
sixty days from the date of written notice of the reduction in
the borrowing base to pay the difference. Additionally, the
Company is subject to quarterly reviews of compliance with the
covenants under the bank facility including minimum coverage
ratios relating to interest, working capital and advances to
Sino-American Energy Corporation. In the event of a default
under the covenants, the Company may not be able to access funds
otherwise available under the facility. As of December31,
2005, the Company was in compliance with required ratios of the
bank facility. The debt outstanding, if any, under the credit facility is
secured by a majority of the Companys proved domestic oil
and gas properties. Other long-term obligations: These costs relate to the
long-term portion of production taxes payable, a liability
associated with imbalanced production, our asset retirement
obligations mentioned in Note2 and the long-term portion
of the Companys incentive compensation plan.   
6.
STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Companys Stock Incentive Plans are administered by the
Board of Directors the Plan Administrator. The
Plan Administrator may make awards of stock options to
employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company as
long as the aggregate number of common shares issuable to any
one person pursuant to incentives does not exceed 5% of the
number of common shares outstanding at the time of the award. In
addition, no participant may receive during any fiscal year of
the Companys awards of incentives covering an aggregate of
more than 500,000 common shares. The Plan Administrator
determines the vesting requirements and any vesting restrictions
or forfeitures in certain circumstances. Incentives may not have
an exercise period longer than 10years. The exercise price
of the stock may not be less than the fair market value of the
common shares at the time of award, where fair market
value means the weighted average trading price of the
common shares for the five trading days preceding the date of
the award. On April29, 2005, the shareholders approved the adoption
of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan. The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the Plan
Administrator to award Incentives from the effective date of the
2005 Stock Incentive Plan. The 2005 Stock Incentive Plan is in
addition to the Companys existing stock option plans the
2000 Option Plan and the 1998 Stock
Plan. The 2000 Option Plan and the 1998 Stock Plan remain
effective and the Company will make grants under each of the
existing plans. The purpose of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan is to foster and
promote the long-term financial success of the Company and to
increase shareholder value by attracting, motivating and
retaining key employees, consultants and directors and providing
such participants in the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan with a
program for obtaining an ownership interest in the Company that
links and aligns their personal interests with those of the
Companys shareholders, thus enabling such participants to
share in the long-term growth and success of the Company. To
accomplish these goals, the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan permits
the granting of incentive stock 57 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued options, non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, and other stock-based awards, some of which
may require the satisfaction of performance-based criteria in
order to be payable to participants. The 2005 Stock Incentive
Plan is an important component of the total compensation package
offered to employees and directors, reflecting the importance
that the Company places on motivating and rewarding superior
results with long-term, performance-based incentives. The following table summarizes the changes in stock options for

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payments
SFASNo123R. SFASNo123R
is a revision of SFASNo123, Accounting for
Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion 25.
Among other items, SFAS No123R eliminates the use of APB
Opinion 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and
requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services
received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on
the grant date fair value of those awards, in 58 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the financial statements. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an
alternative under the new standard. The Company will adopt SFAS
No123R as of the required effective date for calendar
year companies, which is January1, 2006. SFASNo123R permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a modified prospective
method, or a modified retrospective method. Under
the modified prospective method, compensation cost
is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the
effective date, based on the requirements of
SFASNo123R for all share-based payments granted
after that date, and based on the requirements of
SFASNo123 for all unvested awards granted prior to
the effective date of SFAS No123R. Under the
modified retrospective method, the requirements are
the same as under the modified prospective method,
but also permit entities to restate financial statements of
previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in
accordance with SFAS No123. At December31, 2005,
all stock options granted to date were fully vested. The Company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model
i.e., Black-Scholes to measure the fair value of stock options
granted to Employees. While SFASNo123R permits
entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also
permits the use of a more complex binomial, or
lattice model. Based upon research done by the
Company on the alternative models available to value option
grants, and in conjunction with the type and number of stock
options expected to be issued in the future, the Company has
determined that it will continue to use the Black-Scholes model
for option valuation as of the current time. SFASNo123R includes several modifications to the
way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements.
The expense for certain types of option grants is only
deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event
takes place, which could cause variability in the Companys
effective tax rates recorded throughout the year.
SFASNo123R does not allow companies to
predict when these taxable events will take place.
Furthermore, it requires that the benefits associated with the
tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be
reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating
cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement
will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing
cash flows in periods after the effective date. These future
amounts cannot be estimated, because they depend on, among other
things, when employees exercise stock options.   
7.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company has, in the past, used derivative instruments as one
way to manage its exposure to commodity prices. The Company has
periodically entered into fixed-price to index-price swap
agreements in order to hedge a portion of its production. The
purpose of the swaps is to provide a measure of stability to the
Companys cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and
gas prices. The derivatives reduce the Companys exposure
on the hedged volumes to decreases in commodity prices and limit
the benefit the Company might otherwise have received from any
increases in commodity prices on the hedged volumes. The Company
recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities
in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting treatment for
the changes in fair value as specified in SFASNo133
is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is
designated as a hedge. For derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges, changes in fair value, to the extent the hedge is
effective, are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income Loss
on the balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings as oil and gas revenue. For all other derivatives,
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as income or
expense. During 2005, the Company recognized costs associated with
financially settled swaps to counter-parties totaling $9,286,000
as its net realization from hedging activities. This total
includes $999,900 for the first quarter of 2005, $1,440,800 for
the second quarter of 2005, $2,090,600 for the third quarter of
2005, and $4,754,700 for the fourth quarter of 2005. At December31, 2005, the Company had no open derivative
contracts to manage price risk on its natural gas production. 59 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company also utilizes fixed price forward natural gas sales
at southwest Wyoming delivery points to hedge its commodity
exposure. The Company had the following physical delivery

In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The
ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods
in which the temporary differences become deductible. Among
other items, management considers the scheduled reversal of
deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and
available tax planning strategies. As of December31, 2004, the Company had U.S.federal
regular tax net operating loss carryforwards
NOLs of approximately $167million
which were available to offset future U.S.taxable income.
The Company did not record any valuation allowance attributable
to its U.S.NOLs as management estimated that it was
more likely than not that the U.S.NOLs would be
fully utilized before they expire. These U.S.NOLs
were fully utilized to offset U.S.taxable income in 2005. The Company has Canadian non-capital tax loss carryforwards of
approximately $56million and $73million as of
December31, 2005 and December31, 2004, respectively.
The benefit of the Canadian loss carryforwards can only be
utilized to the extent the Company generates future taxable
income in Canada. If not utilized, the $56million
Canadian loss carryforward will expire between 2006 and 2015. Since the Company currently has no income producing operations
in Canada, management estimates that it is more likely than not
that the Canadian loss carryforwards will not be utilized. A
valuation allowance has been recorded at December31, 2005
and December31, 2004 attributable to this deferred tax
asset. The Company periodically uses derivative instruments designated
as cash flow hedges as a method of managing its exposure to
commodity price fluctuations. To the extent these hedges are
effective, changes in the fair value of these derivative
instruments are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income, net of
income tax. At December31, 2005, the Company had no open
derivative contracts; and, therefore, no recorded tax benefit
attributable to unrecognized loss on derivative instruments. A
tax benefit attributable to unrecognized loss on 61 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued derivative instruments of $1,440,236 was allocated directly to
Other Comprehensive Income as of December31, 2004.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company sponsors a qualified, tax-deferred savings plan in
accordance with provisions of Section401k of the
Internal Revenue Code for its employees. Employees may defer up
to 15% of their compensation, subject to certain limitations.
The Company matches the employee contributions up to 5% of
employee compensation along with a profit sharing contribution
of 8%. The plan operates on a calendar year basis and began in
February 1998. The expense associated with the Companys
contribution was $507,306, $396,684 and $299,832 for the years
ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   
10.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The Company has two reportable operating segments, one domestic
and one foreign, which are in the business of natural gas and
crude oil exploration and production. The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates
performance based on profit or loss from oil and gas operations
before price-risk management and other, general and
administrative expenses and interest expense. The Companys
reportable operating segments are managed separately based on
their geographic locations. Financial information by operating
segment is presented below

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES On October16, 2003 the operator of the Companys
properties in China, Kerr-McGee, signed a 15year contract,
which provides for up to an additional 10years, to lease a
floating production storage offloading unit FPSO.
The Company ratified the contract for its net share which is
891%. The FPSO service agreement calls for a day rate lease
payment and a sliding scale per barrel processing fee that
decreases based on cumulative barrels processed. The lease
contains a cancellation fee based on a sliding time-scale
cancellation fee decreases with time, which as of
December31, 2005 was $33million net to the
Companys 891% interest. The Company considers it very
unlikely that a lease cancellation situation will occur. Due to
the terms of the lease, the Company cannot estimate with any
degree of accuracy the costs it may incur during the life of the
lease. The Companys net share for the costs of the FPSO in
2005 was approximately $18million. 63 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued In May 2003, the Company amended its prior office lease in
Englewood, Colorado, which it has committed to through June
2008. The Companys total remaining commitment at
December31, 2005 on this lease is $677,791 at
December31, 2005 $265,485 in 2006, $273,530 in 2007 and
$138,776 in 2008. In December 2003, the Company signed a lease
for office space in Houston, Texas, which it has committed to
through April 2007 for a total remaining commitment of $135,792
$101,844 in 2006 and $33,948 in 2007 at December31,
2005. The total remaining commitment for both offices is
$813,583. As of December31, 2005, the Company had committed to
drilling obligations with certain rig contractors totalling
$108,410,500 with $104,610,500 due in one to three years and the
balance of $3,800,000 due in three to five years. The
commitments expire in 2009 and were entered into to fulfill the
Companys 2006-2008 drilling program initiatives in Wyoming. During 2005, the Company took a major step toward assuring that
the pipeline infrastructure to move the Companys natural
gas supplies away from southwest Wyoming will be expanded to
provide sufficient capacity to transport its natural gas
production and to provide for reasonable basis differentials for
its natural gas in the future. The Company agreed to become an
anchor shipper on the proposed Rockies Express Pipeline project,
sponsored by subsidiaries of Kinder Morgan and Sempra Energy.
The Rockies Express Pipeline, if built as proposed, would be the
largest natural gas transmission pipeline project of its type
built in the United States in more than 20years. As
proposed, the Rockies Express Pipeline would begin at the Opal
Processing Plant in southwest Wyoming, and traverse Wyoming and
several other states to an ultimate terminus in eastern Ohio.
This project is projected to cover more than 1,800miles
and is contemplated to be a large-diameter 42,
high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The Rockies Express
Pipeline, if built, will be an interstate pipeline and would
therefore be subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. On December19, 2005, the Company signed, subject to Board
of Director approval, a Precedent Agreement with Rockies Express
Pipeline, LLC committing to take firm transportation capacity in
the proposed Rockies Express interstate pipeline. The
Companys commitment involves capacity of
200,000MMBtu per day of natural gas for a term of
10years, and the Company will be obligated to pay to
Rockies Express certain demand charges related to its rights to
hold this firm transportation capacity as an anchor shipper. The
Companys Board of Directors approved the Precedent
Agreement on February6, 2006 and Kinder Morgan, as the
Managing Member of the Rockies Express Pipeline LLC advised the
Company of their final approval of the Precedent Agreement, and
their intent to proceed with the construction of the Rockies
Express Pipeline on February28, 2006. Although the Company
is optimistic that the Rockies Express Pipeline project will
receive the necessary regulatory approvals and be constructed in
a timely manner, there can be no assurances that the Rockies
Express Pipeline will be built, nor will there be any assurances
that, if built, it will prevent large basis differentials from
occurring in the future. The Company is currently involved in various routine disputes
and allegations incidental to its business operations. While it
is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of these
matters, management, after consultation with legal counsel, is
of the opinion that the final resolution of all such currently
pending or threatened litigation is not likely to have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company.   
12.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS For certain of the Companys financial instruments,
including accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts
approximate fair value due to the immediate or short-term
maturity of these financial instruments. The Companys revenues are derived principally from
uncollateralized sales to customers in the natural gas and oil
industry. The concentration of credit risk in a single industry
affects the Companys overall exposure to credit risk
because customers may be similarly affected by changes in
economic and other 64 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued conditions. In 2005, the Company had three significant
customers, CNOOC, Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. and Sempra
Energy Trading, that individually accounted for 10% or more of
the Companys total natural gas and oil sales during 2005.

DISCLOSURE ABOUT OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES
UNAUDITED The following information about the Companys oil and gas
producing activities is presented in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No69, Disclosure
About Oil and Gas Producing Activities   
A.
OIL AND GAS RESERVES The determination of oil and gas reserves is complex and highly
interpretive. Assumptions used to estimate reserve information
may significantly increase or decrease such reserves in future
periods. The estimates of reserves are subject to continuing
changes and, therefore, an accurate determination of reserves
may not be possible for many years because of the time needed
for development, drilling, testing, and studies of reservoirs.
The following unaudited tables as of December31, 2005,
2004 and 2003 are based upon estimates prepared by Netherland,
Sewell Associates, Inc. dated January27, 2006,
January24, 2005 and January23, 2004, respectively.
The estimates for properties in China were prepared by Ryder
Scott Company in a report dated January31, 2006 and
February11, 2005. These are estimated quantities of proved
oil and gas reserves for the Company and the changes in total
proved reserves as of December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. All
such reserves are located in the Green River Basin, Wyoming and
Bohai Bay, China. 65 Table of Contents ULTRA PETROLEUM CORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

C.STANDARDIZED
MEASURE US$000 The following table sets forth a standardized measure of the
estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to the
Companys proved natural gas reserves. Natural gas prices
have fluctuated widely in recent years. The calculated weighted
average sales prices utilized for the purposes of estimating the
Companys proved reserves and future net revenues were
$800, $546, and $559per Mcf of natural gas at
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
calculated weighted average oil price at December31, 2005,
2004, and 2003 for Wyoming was $6081, $4280 and 3187
respectively. The calculated weighted average crude oil price at
December31, 2005 and 2004 for China was a Duri price of
$4874 and $2946, respectively. The future production and
development costs represent the estimated future expenditures to
be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves,
assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Future
income tax expense was computed by applying statutory income tax
rates to the difference between pretax net cash flows relating
to the Companys proved reserves and the tax basis of
proved properties and available operating loss carryovers.

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating
quantities of proved reserves and projected future rates of
production and timing of development expenditures, including
many factors beyond the control of the Company. The reserve data
and standardized measures set forth herein represent only
estimates. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of
estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot
be measured in an exact way and the accuracy of any reserve
estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a
result, estimates of different engineers often vary. In
addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent
to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such
estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different
from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately
recovered. Further, the estimated future net revenues from
proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon
certain assumptions, including geologic success, prices, future
production levels and costs that may not prove correct over
time. Predictions of future production levels are subject to
great uncertainty, and the meaningfulness of such estimates is
highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which
they are based. Historically, oil and gas prices have fluctuated
widely.

Controls and Procedures.   
a
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in
Rules13a-15e
and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Companys
reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and
communicated to management, including the Companys Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on
Form10-K, an evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of the Companys
management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the
Companys CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
December31, 2005, because of the material weaknesses
described below.   
b
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate control over financial reporting for the Company as
such term is defined in Rules13a-15f and 15d-15f
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In order
to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, as required by Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, management has conducted an assessment using the criteria
in Internal Control Integrated Framework,
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission COSO. Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. A material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of
control deficiencies that results in a more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. As of
December31, 2005, the Company identified the following
material weaknesses   
The Company did not maintain effective company level controls.
Specifically, icertain of its accounting personnel in
key roles did not possess an appropriate level of technical
expertise, and iithe Companys monitoring of the
internal audit function was not sufficient to provide management
a basis to assess the quality of the Companys internal
control performance over time. These deficiencies resulted in
more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the Companys annual or interim financial statements would
not be prevented or detected.     
The Company did not have adequate policies and procedures
regarding supervisory review of account reconciliations and
account and transaction analyses. This deficiency resulted in
the following material errors in the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements   
misclassification of costs between proved and unproved oil and
gas properties and understatement of depletion expense     
improper reporting of value added taxes     
understatement of asset retirement obligations     
overstatement in tubular inventory     
understatement of capitalized well cost accrued liabilities; and 71 Table of Contents   
overstatement of accounts receivable.   
These errors have been corrected by management prior to the
issuance of the Companys 2005 consolidated financial
statements.   
The Company did not have adequate policies and procedures to
ensure that accurate and reliable interim and annual
consolidated financial statements were prepared and reviewed on
a timely basis. Specifically, the Company did not have   
sufficient personnel with the skills and experience in the
application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and     
policies and procedures regarding the preparation and management
review of footnote disclosures accompanying the Companys
financial statements.   
As a result of these deficiencies, material errors were
identified in the footnotes to the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements. These errors have been
corrected by management prior to the issuance of the
Companys 2005 consolidated financial statements. As a result of the aforementioned material weaknesses,
management has concluded that the Company did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, based on the criteria in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys independent registered public accountants,
KPMG LLP, have audited and issued a report on managements
assessment of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting, which report appears herein.   
c
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, whether any
changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
occurred during our last fiscal quarter have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. Based on the
evaluation we conducted, management has concluded that no such
changes have occurred. The Companys management has identified what it believes
are the steps necessary to address the material weakness
described above, as follows   
1Increasing training for the Companys current
accounting personnel, hiring additional accounting personnel and
engaging outside consultants with technical accounting
expertise, as needed, and reorganizing the accounting department
to ensure that accounting personnel have adequate experience,
skills and knowledge relating to the accounting and internal
audit functions assigned to them.     
2Establishing additional and refining current policies
and procedures to more effectively reconcile its accounting
entries along with better documentation procedures to meet the
standards established by COSO. The Company expects to complete these remedial actions by the
end of the second quarter of 2006.   
d
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Ultra Petroleum Corp. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting Item9Ab, that Ultra Petroleum
Corp. and subsidiaries the Company did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, because of the effect of material
weaknesses identified in managements assessment, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Ultra Petroleum
Corp.s management is responsible for 72 Table of Contents maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The
following material weaknesses have been identified and included
in managements assessment as of December31, 2005   
The Company did not maintain effective company level controls.
Specifically, icertain of its accounting personnel in
key roles did not possess an appropriate level of technical
expertise, and iithe Companys monitoring of the
internal audit function was not sufficient to provide management
a basis to assess the quality of the Companys internal
control performance over time. These deficiencies resulted in
more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
the Companys annual or interim financial statements would
not be prevented or detected.     
The Company did not have adequate policies and procedures
regarding supervisory review of account reconciliations and
account and transaction analyses. This deficiency resulted in
the following material errors in the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements   
misclassification of costs between proved and unproved oil and
gas properties and understatement of depletion expense     
improper reporting of value added taxes     
understatement of asset retirement obligations     
overstatement in tubular inventory     
understatement of capitalized well cost accrued liabilities; and     
overstatement of accounts receivable. 73 Table of Contents   
The Company did not have adequate policies and procedures to
ensure that accurate and reliable interim and annual
consolidated financial statements were prepared and reviewed on
a timely basis. Specifically, the Company did not have   
sufficient personnel with the skills and experience in the
application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and     
policies and procedures regarding the preparation and management
review of footnote disclosures accompanying the Companys
financial statements. As a result of these deficiencies, material errors were
identified in the footnotes to the Companys preliminary
2005 consolidated financial statements. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of Ultra Petroleum Corp. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and retained
earnings, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2005.
The aforementioned material weaknesses were considered in
determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests
applied in our audit of the December31, 2005 consolidated
financial statements, and this report does not affect our report
dated March30, 2006, which expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, managements assessment that Ultra
Petroleum Corp. and subsidiaries did not maintain effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the
material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the
objectives of the control criteria, Ultra Petroleum Corp. and
subsidiaries have not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. s/ KPMG LLP Denver, Colorado March30, 2006
