The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2000 and March
26, 1999, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March
31, 2000. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in
the index at 14a. These financial statements and the financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Keystone
Automotive Industries, Inc. at March 31, 2000 and March 26, 1999, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2000
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Keystone Automotive Industries, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries the
Company. Significant subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial
statements include North Star Plating Company North Star, Inteuro Parts
Distributors, Inc. Inteuro and Republic Automotive Parts, Inc.
Republic. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
Business Information
The principal business of the Company is the distribution of replacement
parts for automobiles and light trucks to collision repair shops through a
network of service centers located within the United States, one in Mexico,
and one in Canada.
Fiscal Year
The Company uses a 52/53 week fiscal year. The Company fiscal year ends on
the last Friday of March. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2000 included 53
weeks. The fiscal years ended March 26, 1999 and March 27, 1998 each included
52 week periods.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Concentrations of Risk
Accounts receivable subject the Company to a potential concentration of
credit risk. Substantially all of the Company customers are in the auto body
repair business, none representing more than 1% of sales. The Company performs
periodic credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and
generally does not require collateral. Receivables are generally due within 30
days. Credit losses have consistently been within management expectations.
During 2000 and 1999, the Company imported 20% and 25% of its products from
the Far East, respectively.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, bankers acceptances and other short-term obligations approximate cost
due to the short period of time to maturity. Fair values of long-term debt,
which have been determined based on borrowing rates currently available to the
Company for loans with similar terms or maturity, approximate the carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash
and cash equivalents are held by major financial institutions.
26           KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Inventories
The Company inventories consist primarily of automotive after market
collision replacement parts, paint and related items and bumpers. Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost first-in, first-out method or market.
Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews the reasonability of its long-lived assets, including
goodwill, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, whenever significant events or changes occur
which might impair the recovery of the recorded costs. The Company records
impairment losses on long-lived assets held and used in operations when
indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated
to be generated by those assets are less than their related carrying amounts.
If impairment exists, the amount of such impairment is calculated based upon
discounted cash flows or the market values compared to the recorded costs. In
addition, the Company accounts for its long-lived assets to be disposed of at
the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less selling and disposal
costs.
During fiscal 2000, the Company recorded an impairment reserve related to
goodwill and covenants not to compete aggregating $33 million relating to
certain acquisitions and an impairment reserve of approximately $600,000
relating to tooling acquired in an acquisition.
Depreciation and Amortization
The Company uses the straight-line method for calculating depreciation and
amortization of property, plant, and equipment over the following estimated
useful lives               
Buildings. 20 years
Machinery and
equipment. 5-12 years
Furniture and fixtures. 5-7 years
Auto and truck. 3-5 years
Leasehold improvements. Term of lease or life of the asset, whichever is shorter Goodwill and Other Intangibles
Goodwill, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair values
of the net assets of acquired entities, is amortized over 15 to 30 years using
the straight-line method. Other intangibles are comprised of covenants not to
compete. Covenants not to compete are amortized using the straight-line method
over the terms of the agreements, generally 3-5 years.
Investment
In November 1999, the Company made an investment in GoMedia, Inc., a company
which has developed an online business community, goClaims.com, addressing the
automotive collision repair and claims processing market. The Company is
accounting for its investment $795,000 using the cost method of accounting.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of delivery or
shipment. The Company provides its customers the right to return products that
are damaged or defective. The effect of these programs is estimated and
current period sales and costs of sales are reduced accordingly.
27           KEYSTONE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued Stock-Based Compensation
The Company elected to continue to account for stock-based compensation
plans using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees, and related interpretations. Under the provisions of APB No.
25, compensation expense is measured at the grant date for the difference
between the fair value of the stock and the exercise price. The Company has
not granted stock options at less than the fair value of the stock at the date
of grant.
New Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. It
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives in the statement of
financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. In 1999, the
FASB issued SFAS No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133--an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 133, which defers the effective date of SFAS
No. 133 for one year. The Company must implement SFAS No. 133 by the first
quarter of 2001 and has not yet made a final determination of its impact on
the financial statements.
In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements. The effective date of SAB 101 is the first fiscal quarter of the
fiscal year beginning after December 15, 1999. The Company plans to apply SAB
101 effective April 1, 2000; however, the Company does not expect the
application of SAB 101 to have a significant impact on its results of
operations.
2. ACQUISITIONS
In June 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of Republic. The Company
issued approximately 2,907,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for the
outstanding common stock of Republic total purchase price of approximately
$631 million using an average share price of $2169. The fair value of the
assets acquired approximated $419 million, net of approximately $288 million
of liabilities assumed. The excess of the purchase price over assets acquired
goodwill approximated $212 million and is being amortized over 30 years.
The acquisition of Republic is being accounted for under the purchase method
of accounting. At the time of the acquisition, Republic was engaged in the
distribution of automotive mechanical hard parts and aftermarket collision
replacement parts.
The net assets acquired as part of the Republic transaction, which related
to the Republic mechanical hard parts operations, were recorded as assets held
for sale in the allocation of the opening balance sheet at June 27, 1998. The
assets held for sale were recorded at fair value based upon the final sales
price. The results of operations from June 27, 1998 through the date of sale
of the mechanical hard parts operations were accounted for as an adjustment to
the carrying amount of the assets. The assets held for sale were sold in a
series of transactions during fiscal 1999, which resulted in a gain. The gain
on sales has been accounted for as an adjustment of the original purchase
price. The operating results of the Company from June 27, 1998, excluded any
effects from the mechanical hard parts business.

companies for approximately $178 million cash, $18 million in stock and a
note payable of $150,000. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchases,
and accordingly the assets and liabilities of the acquired entities have been
recorded at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. The
excess of purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
was approximately $99 million and has been recorded as goodwill and is being
amortized over 15 to 20 years. The unaudited proforma results for fiscal 1998
and 1999, assuming these other acquisitions had been made at the beginning of
fiscal 1998, would not be materially different from the pro forma results
presented above.
Effective January 1, 1998, Inteuro merged with and into the Company. An
aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the Company common stock were issued in
exchange for all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Inteuro. This
transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and therefore, all
prior period financial statements presented include Inteuro historical
activities. Inteuro used a December 31 year end. The Company financial
statements for fiscal 1998 combine the Company consolidated financial
statements for the year ended March 27, 1998, with Inteuro financial
statements for year ended December 31, 1997.
For the quarter ended March 28, 1997, net income for Inteuro was $385,000,
offset by S-Corp. distributions of $2,457,000, resulting in a net adjustment
to retained earnings of $2,072,000. Revenue and expenses of $9,164,000 and
$8,779,000, respectively, were recorded for the quarter ended March 28, 1997
for Inteuro which have not been reflected in the statement of operations.
Prior to the merger, the net income of Inteuro had been taxed under
subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore, did not reflect
the corporate tax liability that was passed through to its shareholders. The
proforma net income and earnings per share included herein reflect income tax
expense of the combined companies at an estimated statutory rate of 39%.
In connection with the merger with Inteuro, $442,000 of merger costs and
expenses were incurred and have been charged to operations for the year ended
and March 27, 1998. The merger costs and expenses consisted primarily of
legal, accounting, and investment banking fees.
3. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
Goodwill increased approximately $1,088,000, net of impairment losses
recorded during fiscal 2000. Amortization expense for goodwill and other
intangibles for the years ended March 31, 2000, March 26, 1999 and March 27,
1998 was $2,649,000, $2,050,000 and $967,000, respectively, and is included
with depreciation and amortization expense.

The Company maintains a revolving line of credit with a commercial lender
that provides a $30,000,000 unsecured credit facility that expires, as
amended, in September 2000. Initial advances under the revolving line of
credit are made with interest at the lender prime rate; however, at the
Company option, all advances may be converted to LIBOR plus 075 0875%.
The agreement also contains an unused line charge of 0125%. At March 31,
2000, $12,500,000 was outstanding under the line of credit. The loan agreement
is subject to certain restrictive covenants and requires that the Company
maintain certain financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all
covenants as of March 31, 2000.
5. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
In June 1996, the Company completed its initial public offering of 1,500,000
shares at an offering price of $900 per share, which generated net proceeds
of $11,622,000. In June 1997, the Company Registration Statement on Form S-1
was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, permitting
the Company to sell additional shares of its common stock to the public. The
Company and selling shareholders sold 2,610,000 shares each, at an offering
price of $1550 per share, which generated net proceeds to the Company of
$37,776,000 net of underwriter commissions and offering costs. The Company
proceeds from both offerings were used to pay down bank debt, to fund
acquisitions and for working capital. Additionally, in August 1997, the
Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase its authorized
shares of common stock to 50,000,000.
In June 1998, as part of the Company acquisition of Republic, the Company
issued approximately 2,907,000 shares using an average share price of $2169.
In September 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase
up to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock at such times and at such prices as
the President and Chief Financial Officer deemed appropriate. Repurchased
shares were redeemed and treated as authorized but unissued shares. At March
26, 1999, the Company had repurchased approximately 1,009,000 shares of its
common stock at an average cost of $1867 per share.
In March 1999, the Company issued 150,000 shares of unregistered stock using
an average share price of $1219 to acquire Collision Parts Distributors Co.
In February 2000, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 100,000 shares of
the Company stock, at an exercise price of $650 per share to a vendor. The
warrant is exercisable starting in February 2001 through 2005, or through the
date of dissolution of the agreement. Using the intrinsic value method, the
Company recorded the warrant in Shareholders' equity at $236,000 and will
amortize the expense over the period services are received from the vendor.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued 6. EARNINGS PER SHARE
In 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. SFAS No. 128
replaced the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with
basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic
earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share
amounts for all periods have been presented and, where appropriate, restated
to conform to the SFAS No. 128 requirements. The following table sets forth
the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share                              Year ended

The warrant to purchase 100,000 shares had an exercise price greater than
the average market price of common stock at March 31, 2000, and therefore was
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
would be an antidilutive.
7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company has entered into various property lease agreements with related
parties, including certain of the Company directors and officers and
agreements with a corporation which is owned by a family member of a Company
officer and director. The leases contain terms up to 10 years. The Company
believes that the terms and conditions of such leases with affiliated parties
are no less favorable than could have been obtained from unaffiliated parties
in arm length transactions at the time such leases were entered into. Rent
expense for related party lease agreements, included in the total rent
expense, amounted to $1,373,000, $1,863,000 and $1,715,000 for 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively, exclusive of the Company obligation for property taxes
and insurance.

The liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
Significant components of the Company deferred tax liabilities and assets

Prior to the purchase of Inteuro by the Company on January 1, 1998, Inteuro
had elected to be treated as an S corporation under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, taxable income of Inteuro has been
reported in the tax returns of the individual shareholders of Inteuro.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Inteuro on January 1, 1998, the operating
results of Inteuro are included in the consolidated federal and state tax
returns of the Company.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company terminated its employee stock ownership plan which covers
substantially all of its employees. Final payout is expected to occur during
fiscal 1999. Under the terms of the Internal Revenue Code, each year tax
deductible contribution is limited to a maximum of 15% of the Company
qualified payroll. A carryover of unused allowable contributions is allowed,
subject to certain limits. Under the terms of the plan, the Company makes the
contribution to the Trustee, who is required to follow the Administrative
Committee investment decisions. There were no Company contributions to the
plan in fiscal 1997, 1998 nor 1999.
In March 1979, the Company adopted a defined benefit pension plan the
Plan to provide pension benefits to all non-union employees. Plan benefits
are based on an employee years of service and the compensation during the
five years of employment which would yield the highest average compensation.
Effective in April 1997, the Company suspended the accrual of future benefits
resulting in a curtailment gain of $427,000. The curtailment gain was used to
offset unrecognized net losses of the Plan. The assets of the Plan consist
primarily of investments in mutual funds, time certificates of deposit, and
marketable debt securities. The Company policy is to fund pension cost
accrued.
In June 1998, the Company acquired Republic, including its pension and
postretirement life and health insurance plans Health and Life Plans.
Republic defined benefit plan covers substantially all employees. Benefits
under this plan generally are based upon the employee years of service and
compensation preceding retirement. The Company general funding policy is to
contribute amounts deductible for federal income taxes. Under the Health and
Life Plans, the Company contributes toward the cost of health insurance
benefits for certain retired employees. In order to be eligible for
postretirement health insurance coverage, an employee must retire after
attainment of age 55 and completion of 10 years of service, or attainment of
age 50 and completion of 15 years of service. After attainment of age 65, the
employee will not be eligible for coverage under the health insurance plan. In
order to be eligible for life insurance benefits, an employee must retire
after attaining age 55 and completing 10 years of service, or attaining age 50
and completing 15 years of service. Eligible retirees will receive a life
insurance benefit of $2,500 for which the Company pays the full cost. The
Health and Life Plans are unfunded and therefore, premiums are paid from the
Company current operations.

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for
Pensions, at March 26, 1999 the Company recorded a minimum pension liability
representing the excess of the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair
value of the plan assets. The liability has been offset by intangible assets
to the extent possible. The balance of the liability of $890,000 was reported
in accumulated comprehensive income loss, net of applicable deferred income
taxes of $363,000. No minimum pension liability exists at March 31, 2000.
In determining the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations
for the Company Plan, at March 31, 2000 and March 26, 1999, a discount rate
of 5% was used. The Company Plan was frozen effective March 26, 1999 and
therefore, there were no future compensation increases for the Plan for the
periods subsequent to March 26, 1999. Effective June 30, 1999, the accrual of
future benefits under the Republic defined

benefit plan was suspended. The defined benefit plans of the Company and
Republic were merged on December 31, 1999. In determining the actuarial
present value of projected benefit obligations for the merged plan at
March 31, 2000, a discount rate of 8% was issued. There are no future
compensation increases due to the suspension of benefit accruals. The expected
long-term annual rate of return on assets was 8% for the year ended March 31,
2000. The expected long-term annual rate of return on assets was 5% for the
year ended March 26, 1999.
The actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations at March 26,
1999 for the Republic pension plan, used a discount rate of 7%. The assumed
future compensation increases for the Republic pension plan for the year ended
March 26, 1999 was 5% and the expected long-term annual rate of return on
assets was 95%.
For the Health and Life Plans, the actuarial present value of benefit
obligations at March 31, 2000 and March 26, 1999, assumed a discount rate of
8% and 7%, respectively. The assumed healthcare cost trend rate for 2000 and
later was 8%. The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect
on the amounts reported. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health

Plan the 1996 Plan. There were 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock reserved
for issuance under the 1996 Plan. The 1996 Plan provides for granting of stock
options that may be either incentive stock options within the meaning of
Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 the Code or non-
qualified stock options, which do not satisfy the provisions of Section 422A
of the Code. Options are required to be granted at an option price per share
equal to the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant. Stock
options may not be granted longer than 10 years from the date of the 1996
