Board of Directors and Stockholders
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31, 2007 and 2006,
and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
As
discussed in Note1 to the financial statements, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. changed its method of accounting for share-based compensation as of January1, 2006. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
In this annual report on Form10-K, Rigel, we, us and our refer to Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. common stock refers to Rigel
common stock, par value $0001 per share. 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Nature of operations and basis of presentation  We were incorporated in Delaware in June 1996. We are a clinical-stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel, small molecule drugs for the
treatment of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, cancer and viral diseases. 
Financial Statement Preparation 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the fair value of short-term investments,
period of the research collaborations, determination of at-risk milestones, fair values of stock-based compensation awards, impairment assessments, the estimated useful life of assets and
contingencies. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made. To the
extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. 
Stock Award Plans 
We have two stock option plans, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and 2000 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, that provide for granting to our
officers, directors and all other employees and consultants options to purchase shares of our common stock. Under the plans, we may issue non-qualified options or incentive stock options.
We also have an employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, where eligible employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the
first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. The benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No123R, Share-Based Payment Revised 2004, or SFAS123R, and guidance under the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin 107, or SAB No107. 
Effective
January1, 2006, we adopted the provisions of SFAS123R using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this method, the share-based
compensation costs recognized beginning January1, 2006 includes compensation costs for iall share-based payments granted prior to, but not vested as of January1, 2006, based
on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or SFAS123, and calculated for pro forma
disclosures under SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, or SFAS148, and iiall share-based payments granted subsequent
to January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS123R. Compensation costs under SFAS123R for awards granted prior to
January1, 2006 are recognized using an accelerated method pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights
and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, or FIN28. For awards granted after January1, 2006, we have adopted the use of the straight-line attribution method over the
requisite service period for the entire award. Prior to adopting SFAS123R on January1, 2006, we 
43 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued accounted
for equity-based employee compensation costs under the recognition and measurement principles of APB25. Under the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB25, no
compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. In March 2005, the Securities and
Exchange Commission the SEC issued SAB No107 regarding the SEC interpretation of SFAS123R and the valuation of share-based payments for public companies. We have applied provisions of
SAB No107 in our adoption of SFAS123R. See Note4 for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. 
Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities 
We consider all highly liquid investments in debt securities with a remaining maturity from the date of purchase of 90days or less to be cash equivalents.
Cash equivalents consist of money market funds, corporate debt securities and investments in government-sponsored enterprises. Our short-term investments include obligations of
government-sponsored enterprises and corporate debt securities. By policy, we limit the concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit-quality issuers. 
All
cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities
are carried at fair value at December31, 2007 and 2006. Unrealized gains losses are reported in stockholders' equity and included in other comprehensive income loss. Fair value is
estimated based on available market information. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. See Note5 for a summary of
available-for-sale securities at December31, 2007 and 2006. Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those
instruments. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value at December31, 2007 and 2006. The carrying values of capital lease obligations approximate fair
value due to similar financing arrangements being available to the Company at the market interest rates. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements, if any, are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease,
whichever is shorter. 
Revenue recognition 
We recognize revenue from our collaboration arrangements. Our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under Emerging Issues Task Force
No00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria
are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items. The
consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values, and the applicable revenue 
44 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued recognition
criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned. 
Non-refundable,
up-front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements, including technology access fees, are deferred
and recognized on a straight-line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement, generally the research term. When a research term is not specified, we estimate the time it
will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight-line method over that time period. We review our estimates every quarter for
reasonableness. 
Revenues
related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each contract.
Under these agreements, we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement. The payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a
contractual cost per full-time equivalent employee working on the project. Research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements, except for the Merck collaboration
signed in November 2004 related to ubiquitin ligases, approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements. For the Merck collaboration, we
recognized a pro-rata portion of the invoiced amounts for funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project. When the research portion of the collaboration
ended in May 2007, we recognized the full amount of the deferred revenue related to the contract as we had no further obligations. It is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort
expended, however, revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the arrangement. 
Revenues
associated with at-risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as set forth in the applicable
agreement. 
Research and development 
Research and development expenses include costs for scientific personnel, supplies, equipment, consultants, research sponsored by us, allocated facility costs,
costs related to pre-clinical and clinical trials, and stock-based compensation expense. All such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred. Collaboration
agreements generally specify minimum levels of research effort required to be performed by us. 
Segment reporting  We operate our business in one reportable segment: the discovery and development of novel, small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, cancer
and other viral diseases. We primarily operate in the United States. 
Contingencies 
We are subject to claims related to the patent protection of certain of our technologies. We are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or
outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each
individual issue. The required reserves may

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued change
in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. Income Taxes 
We use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to an
amount whose realization is more likely than not. 
In
July 2006, the FASB issued FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, or FIN48. This interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements,
the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained in an audit, based on the technical merits of the position. We adopted FIN48 for the year ended
December31, 2007. There was no cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recognized upon adoption. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company financial position
or results of operations. See Note9 for a further discussion of the adoption of FIN48. Net loss per share 
Net loss per share has been computed according to Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No128, Earnings Per Share, which requires disclosure
of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share exclude any dilutive effects of options, shares subject to repurchase, warrants and convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share
include the impact of potentially dilutive securities. 
During
all periods presented, we had securities outstanding which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were excluded from the computation of diluted net
loss per share, as their effect would have been antidilutive. These outstanding securities consist of the following in thousands, except per share information: December31 2007

On December12, 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on EITF Issue No07-1. Accounting for Collaborative
Arrangements,, or EITF07-1. EITF07-1 defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a 
46 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Continued collaborative
arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties. EITF07-1 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
December15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting EITF07-1 on our financial statements and can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time. On
June27, 2007, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on EITF Issue No07-3, Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used
in Future Research and Development Activities, or EITF07-3. EITF07-3 requires companies to defer and capitalize prepaid, nonrefundable research and development
payments to third parties, and amortize them over the period that the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided, subject to an assessment of recoverability.
EITF07-3 is effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after December15, 2007, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are
currently evaluating the impact of adopting EITF07-3 on our financial statements and can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time. In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS157, Fair Value Measurements, or SFAS157. This standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007, except that under FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No157, companies are allowed to delay the effective date of
SFAS157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after November15,
2008. We elected to delay the adoption of SFAS157 for such assets and liabilites and are currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS157 for all other assets and liabilities on our
financial statements. We can not estimate the impact of adoption at this time. 
In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIncluding an amendment of FASB Statement
No115, or SFAS159. SFAS159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. Entities that elect the fair value option
will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis, with few
exceptions. SFAS159 also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and
liabilities. SFAS159 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November15, 2007. We elected not to adopt the fair value option of SFAS159 at this time. 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS 
In December 1998, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Janssen PharmaceuticaN.V., a division of Johnson Johnson Pharmaceutical
and Development,LLC to research and identify novel targets for drug discovery. At the time we entered into the contract, Johnson Johnson paid a one-time
non-refundable, non-creditable fee and provided support for research activities during the research period, which concluded in December 2003. In addition to these fees, we also
received various milestones payments. Johnson Johnson remains obligated to pay us various milestones and royalties in the future if certain conditions are met. 
In
January 2005, we signed a collaborative research and license agreement with Pfizer for the development of intrapulmonary products for the treatment of allergic asthma and chronic
obstructive 
47 
Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS Continued pulmonary
disease COPD. The collaboration is primarily focused on our preclinical small molecule compounds, which inhibit IgE receptor signaling in respiratory tract mast cells by blocking the
signaling enzyme Syk kinase. The goal of the collaboration is for Pfizer to nominate two of the licensed compounds in order to commence advanced preclinical development. We will earn milestone
payments upon the selection of each of the two compounds, as well as in connection with other clinical events and royalties from sales of the resulting products upon marketing approval. Pfizer is
responsible for the manufacture of all preclinical and clinical materials for each compound/product and all costs associated with development and commercialization. We did not have any further
obligations to Pfizer after the research phase of the collaboration ended in February 2007. In connection with this collaboration, Pfizer paid us $100million upfront and purchased
$50million of our common stock at a premium in 2005. In May 2006, we achieved the first milestone and received a $50million milestone payment when Pfizer nominated R343 to commence
advanced preclinical development in allergic asthma. In December 2007, we achieved the second milestone and received another milestone payment of $50million when Pfizer initiated a
Phase1 clinical trial on R343. 
In
May 1999, we entered into a broad collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, pursuant to which we and Novartis agreed to work on up to five different research programs to identify various
targets for drug development. Two programs were initiated in 1999 while the third program to be conducted at Novartis was initiated on January1, 2000. In July 2001, we expanded our
collaboration with Novartis with the initiation of our angiogenesis program, the fourth and final program in our Novartis collaboration as Novartis chose not to exercise its option to add a fifth
project that was to be conducted at Novartis. We currently have no programs with Novartis in the research phase. Novartis remains obliged to pay us various milestones and royalties in the future if
certain conditions are met. 
In
August 2002, we signed an agreement for a collaboration with Daiichi to pursue research related to a specific target from a novel class of drug targets called ligases that control
cancer cell proliferation through protein degradation. Daiichi paid us $09million at the time we entered into the agreement, three milestone payments totaling $46million, and may
become obligated to pay us certain other milestones payments in the future. The research phase of this three-year collaboration expired in August 2005. In addition, we are entitled to
receive royalties on any commercialized products to emerge from the collaboration. Under terms of the agreement, we retain the rights to co-develop and co-promote certain
products resulting from this collaboration in North America while Daiichi retains co-development and promotion rights in the remainder of the world. 
In
November 2004, we entered into a broad collaboration agreement with MerckCo.,Inc. to investigate ubiquitin ligases, a new class of drug target, to find
treatments for cancer and potentially other diseases. At the time we entered into the agreement, we received an initial cash payment of $76million and funding for our research scientists for
two and a half years. We recognized the upfront payment ratably over the two and a half year term of the research agreement. We recognized a pro-rata portion of the invoiced amounts for
funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project for the quarter. When the research portion of the collaboration ended in May 2007, we recognized the full amount of
the deferred revenue related to the contract as we had no further obligations under the collaboration. In 2006, we received payments from Merck of $500,000, triggered by their selection of a fourth
target and our achievement of a milestone relating to a target. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties in the future. Merck is responsible for worldwide development and
commercialization of any resulting compounds and will pay Rigel royalties on future product sales, if any.

Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
2. SPONSORED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS Continued 
In
October 2005, we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with Merck Serono granting them an exclusive license to develop and commercialize product candidates from
our Aurora kinase inhibitor program. Even though the agreement included a basket of compounds within the Aurora kinase inhibitor program, the collaboration and our efforts under the agreement were
focused on R763. We were responsible for all costs associated with the preparation and filing of an IND for R763 while Merck Serono is responsible for all development of R763 following regulatory
acceptance of the IND and will bear all costs thereafter. We are also eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties in the future. In connection with this collaboration, Merck Serono paid us
$100million
upfront and purchased $150million of our common stock at a premium in 2005. We amortized the upfront amount into revenue over the nine months from the initiation of the collaboration in
October 2005. As of June 2006, we had completely recognized the upfront amount into revenue as we had performed all our deliverables under the collaboration and did not have any further obligations to

February 2006, we received a milestone payment of $50million triggered by the regulatory acceptance of the R763 IND in January 2006. In September 2006, we received a
$30million milestone payment from Merck Serono in connection with the initiation of the Phase1 study of R763. In October 2007, we received another $30million milestone
payment from Merck Serono upon their exercise of the option to obtain Japan rights for R763. 3. SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS 
For the year ended December31, 2007, Pfizer, Merck and Merck Serono accounted for 46%, 30% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. For the year ended
December31, 2006, Merck Serono, Pfizer and Merck accounted for 46%, 30% and 24% of total revenues, respectively. For the year ended December31, 2005, Merck, Pfizer, Merck Serono and
Daiichi accounted for 45%, 26%, 15% and 14% of total revenues, respectively. At December31, 2007, we have no accounts receivable, while at December31, 2006, our accounts receivable was
comprised of two customers. Rigel does not require collateral or other security for accounts receivable. 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Employee stock option plans 
In 2005, the 2000 Plan was amended, primarily to iincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan by 2,275,000 shares of
common stock; iiprohibit the board of directors from repricing stock options without stockholder approval; and iiieliminate the evergreen provision feature that provides for
automatic annual increases in the total number of shares reserved for issuance. In 2006, an amendment to the 2000 Plan was approved to primarily increase the number of shares authorized for issuance
by 500,000 shares of common stock. In 2007, the 2000 Plan was amended, primarily increase the number of shares authorized for issuance to an aggregate total of 8,410,403 shares. Options granted under
our 2000 Plan expire no later than ten years from the date of grant. The option price of each incentive stock option shall be at least 100% of the fair value on the date of grant, and the option price
for each nonstatutory stock option shall be not less than 85% of the fair value on the date of grant, as determined by the board of directors. Options may be granted with different vesting terms from
time to time, ranging from zero to five years. As of December31, 2007, a total of 7,154,362 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the 2000 Plan. 
In
2005, the Directors' Plan was amended, primarily to: iincrease the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Directors' Plan by 225,000 shares;
iiincrease the number of shares of common stock subject to the annual option grant to each non-employee director by 8,333 shares to 10,000 shares; iiiincrease the
number of shares of common stock subject to the initial option grant to each new non-employee director under the plan by 13,333 to 20,000 shares; iveliminate the board of
directors' ability to reprice stock options; and vamend the vesting schedule for future options grants, including annual option grants made the day following the Annual Meeting. The exercise
price of options under the Directors' Plan will be equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of the options granted under the Directors' Plan is ten
years. In 2007, the Directors' Plan was amended, primarily increase the number shares authorized for issuance by 110,000 shares to an aggregate total of 435,000 shares. All grants under the Directors'
Plan will vest monthly over two years from date of grant. The Directors' Plan will terminate in September 2009, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the Directors' Plan. As
of December31, 2007, a total of 432,211 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the Directors' Plan. 
In
June 2003, we initiated an offer to exchange options to purchase shares of our common stock with exercise prices equal to or greater than $900 per share to officers, employees,
consultants and non-employee members of our board of directors. We granted replacement options to purchase an aggregate of 344,207 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $920
per share, the fair market value on the date of grant. Any outstanding replacement options expired in August 2006. In August 2006, our board of directors granted new options to officers, directors and
all other employees and consultants who held these repriced options that expired in August 2006. We granted approximately 179,000 options with an exercise price of $956 per share. The options vested
50% at the date of the grant and the remaining 50% will vest monthly over two years. For the year ended December31, 2005, we recorded a non-cash compensation recovery of
approximately $19million related to all employee options eligible for replacement. The recovery resulted from the decrease in the market price of our common stock during 2005. For the years
ended December31, 2006 and 2007, we 
50

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Continued recorded
stock-based compensation expense of approximately $689,000 and $278,000, respectively, relating to the options granted in August 2006. The decrease in 2007 is due to a 50% vesting on grant
date in August 2006. 
In
December 2007, we adopted a Change of Control Severance Plan for employees serving at or above the level of Vice President. Under this plan, under certain conditions, primarily upon a
change in control of the Company, they would receive the payment of certain benefits, including accelerated vesting of all their outstanding stock options and an extension of the period to exercise
outstanding options to the earlier of the original option expiration date or the one year anniversary of the triggering event. There was no stock-based compensation expense incurred during the current
period due to the adoption of the Change of Control Severance Plan. 
Pursuant
to SFAS123R, we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs, instead of accounting for forfeitures as incurred,
which was our previous method. We adjust our stock-based compensation expense as actual forfeitures occur, review our estimated forfeiture rates each quarter and make changes to our estimate as
appropriate. 
Under
SFAS123R, the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have segregated option awards into three
homogenous groups i.e.,Officers and Directors, All Other Employees and Consultants for purposes of determining fair values of options. 
We
determined weighted-average valuation assumptions separately for the groups as follows: VolatilityWe
estimated volatility using the historical share price performance over the expected life of the option up to the point where we have historical
market data.
As our options are not actively traded, implied volatility was not representative of our current volatility. We also considered other factors, such as our current clinical trials and other company
activities, that may affect the volatility of our stock in the future, but determined that at this time historical volatility is more indicative of our expected future stock performance.
Expected
termWe worked with various historical data to determine the most applicable expected term for each option group. These data included: 1for
options exercised, term of the options from option grant date to exercise date; 2for options cancelled, term of the options from grant date to cancellation date, excluding unvested option
forfeitures; and 3for options which remained outstanding at the balance sheet date, term of the options from grant date to the end of the reporting period, and the estimated remaining term
of the options. The consideration and calculation of the above data gave us reasonable estimates of the expected term for each option group. We also considered the vesting schedules of the options
granted and factors surrounding exercise behavior of our groups, our current market price and company activity that may affect our market price. In addition, we also considered the vesting schedules
of the options, the optionee type i.e.,officers and directors, all other employees and consultants and other factors that may affect the expected term of the option. For options granted to
consultants, we use the contractual term of the option, which is generally ten years, for the initial valuation of the option and the remaining contractual term of the option for the succeeding years. 51

option plans. 
For
the year ended December31, 2007, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $209,000, associated with options granted to consultants, reflecting the fair
value and periodic fair value remeasurement of outstanding consultant options under Emerging Issues Task Force No96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other
Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services, or EITF96-18. The valuation is based upon the market value of our common stock and other
assumptions, including the expected future volatility of our stock price, risk-free interest rate and expected term. For consultant options granted in 2007 and 2006, we amortized
stock-based compensation using a straight-line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of
SFAS123R. For options granted prior to January1, 2006, we used the accelerated method for expensing stock-based compensation, which was the method we used prior to adoption. We
recorded stock-based expense of approximately $267,000 and stock-based compensation recovery of approximately $232,000 for the years ended December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, relating to
consultant options. We expect to see continued fluctuations in the future
as a portion of these options are remeasured based on the changes in the current market price of our common stock.

The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of our common stock for the options
that were in-the-money at December31, 2007. During the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under our
stock option plans was approximately $34million, $470,000 and $17million, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December31, 2007, there was
approximately $56million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under our stock option plans
and no unamortized compensation cost related to our ESPP. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 182years. We also had approximately 11million of
unvested stock options at December31, 2007. Future option grants and their valuation will increase our compensation cost in the future as the options are granted, valued and expensed ratably
according to their vesting periods.

1352 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In August 2000, we adopted the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or Purchase Plan, which was approved in September 2000 by our stockholders. In April 2003, the
Purchase Plan was amended to iincrease the number of shares authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan by 66,667 shares of common stock, and iichange the evergreen feature of
the plan. The amendment provides that the increase in the number of shares reserved automatically pursuant to the evergreen feature will be equal to the least of 1% of the outstanding shares on the
date of the annual increase, 88,888 shares or such amount as may be determined by the board. In 2007, the Purchase Plan was amended to iincrease the number of shares authorized for purchase
under ESPP by 1,500,000 and iiterminate the provision providing for an annual increase to the ESPP plan, effective January1, 2008. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to
purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions during defined offering periods. The price at which the stock is purchased is equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the
common stock on the first day of the offering or 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the purchase date. The initial offering period commenced on the effective date of our initial
public offering. We issued 146,243, 159,380 and 73,868 shares of common stock during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, pursuant to the Purchase Plan at an average price of $728

Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Continued per
share, $721 per share and $1007 per share respectively. For 2007, 2006 and 2005, the weighted average fair value of stock issued under the Purchase Plan was $280, $495 and $856, respectively.
The number of shares reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan was increased by 88,888 per year during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December31, 2007, we had 10,245
reserved shares of common stock for future issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. 
The
fair value of awards granted under our ESPP is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses the weighted-average assumptions set forth in
the table below. Our ESPP provides for a twenty-four month offering period comprised of four six-month purchase periods with a look-back option. A
look-back option is a provision in our ESPP where eligible employees can purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value on the
first day of the offering period or 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. The plan also includes a feature whereby a new offering period begins when the fair market value of our common
stock on a purchase date during an offering falls below the fair market value of our common stock on the first day of such offering period. Participants are automatically enrolled in the new offering
period. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock. Expected term represents the purchase periods within our offering period. The risk-free rate for periods
within the contractual life of the option is based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity rates. Stock-based compensation expense relating to our ESPP is recognized according to the FASB Technical
Bulletin No97-1, Accounting under Statement 123 for Certain Employee Stock Purchase Plans with a Look-back Option, or FTB 97-1. As of December31,
2007, there were approximately 10,200 shares in reserve for future issuance under the ESPP. The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions relating to our ESPP for the years ended

principles of APB25. Under the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB25, no compensation expense is recognized when the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the
market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share was determined as if we had accounted for issuances under our stock option
plans and ESPP under the fair value method prescribed by SFAS123, as amended by SFAS No148. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. See the weighted-average assumptions discussed above.

originally to occur in 2006 and 2007. The deferred payments are due to be paid to the landlord over the period starting from 2009 to 2012, but we may prepay the deferred amount at any time
without penalty. We reevaluated the lease amendment under FAS13, Accounting for Leases and determined that the amended lease still qualified as an operating lease. In conjunction with the
lease amendment, a warrant was issued to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock at $1057 per share. The warrant remains exercisable until July 2013 and is exercisable at the option of the
holder. See further discussion of the warrants in Note8Stockholder Equity. 
During
May 2004, we initiated a sublease of approximately 15,000 square feet of our premises to a tenant for a period of two years. The sublease was amended in September 2005 to extend
the term for an additional year. In May 2007, we subleased approximately 6,180 square feet of our space to another tenant. The lease was set to expire and become a month to month lease on
December31, 2007. Rent expense net of sublease income under all operating leases amounted to approximately $151million, $144million and $135million for the years ended
December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
In
August 2000, we obtained a master agreement with a leasing company to finance our capital purchases. Under this agreement, from time to time we sell to the leasing company at cost and
lease back the equipment we purchased. The lease period is three years with the interest rate on the lease fixed at drawdown and ranging approximately from 103% to 109%. Each line has a bargain
purchase buyout provision of $101. We account for the sale-leaseback transaction as financing, with no sale and no gain/loss being recognized. As of December31, 2007, the remaining
principal balance under the credit lines was approximately $18million. 
Obligations
under all capital leases are secured by the assets financed under the leases.

In the second quarter of 2007, we completed a public offering in which we sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock at a price of $975 per share. We received net
proceeds of approximately $523million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs. 
Warrants 
In conjunction with the facilities lease entered into in June 1998, we issued three warrants to the lessor to purchase an aggregate of 16,666 shares of common
stock at an exercise price of $1026 per share. During 2005, warrants to purchase 333 shares of common stock were net exercised and 155 shares of common stock were issued. In December 2007, the
seventh anniversary of the closing of our initial public offering, warrants to purchase 16,333 shares of common stock expired. In
conjunction with the facilities lease entered into in May 2001, we issued a warrant to the lessor to purchase 16,666 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8021 per
share, a 15% premium to market at the time of issuance. This warrant expired in May 2006. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, was
approximately $683,000. This amount has been capitalized in other long-term assets and is being amortized into expense over the life of the lease. As of December31, 2007,
approximately $459,000 remained to be amortized over the life of the lease.

share. The warrant is outstanding as of December31, 2007 and exercisable at any time up to July 2013. The fair value of this warrant, as determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, was

share. This warrant expired in January 2007. The fair market value of this warrant, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was approximately $66,000. This amount was capitalized in other

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets are as follows: December31 2007
2006 Net operating loss carryforwards 111,297 90,670 Research and development credits 15,469 14,581 Capitalized research and development expenses 15,671 10,570 Other, net 15,335 11,039 Total deferred tax assets 157,772 126,860 Valuation allowance 157,772 126,860 Net deferred tax assets 60

9. INCOME TAXES Continued 
As
of December31, 2007, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $3180million, which expire beginning in the year 2011
and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $520million, which expire beginning in the year 2013. 
The
Company also has federal research and development tax credits of $10million, which begin to expire in the year 2012 and state research and development tax credits of
approximately $90million, which have no expiration date. 
No
federal or state income tax expense or benefit was recorded for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, as we incurred net operating losses during these periods.
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a
valuation allowance. The valuation allowance increased by $309million, $171million and $210million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
Included
in the valuation allowance balance at December31, 2007 is $36million of tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options which are not reflected as an
expense for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, any future reduction in the valuation allowance relating to this amount will be credited directly to equity and not reflected as an income tax
benefit in the statement of operations. 
Utilization
of the net operating loss may be subject to annual limitations if there are ownership changes in the future. The limitations are subject to Internal Revenue Code and similar
state provisions and such limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. 
Adoption of FASB Interpretation No48 
On January1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance
with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The following table summarizes the activity related to the Company gross unrecognized tax
benefits: Balance at January1, 2007 upon adoption of FIN48 3,400 Increases related to prior year tax positions Increases related to current year tax positions Balance at December31, 2007 3,400 As
of the date of adoption, the Company recorded a $34million reduction to deferred tax assets for unrecognized tax benefits, all of which were offset by a full valuation
allowance and therefore did not record any adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet. The Company does not anticipate a significant change to its unrecognized tax
benefits over the next twelve months. 
We
file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in California, and the tax returns filed for the years 2002 through 2006 have not been examined and have not expired by
the statute of limitations. Because of net operating loss and research credit carryovers, substantially all of the Company tax years remain open to examination.

Our
policy is that we recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of the date of adoption of FIN48, we did
not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits. 
10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
During the first quarter of 2008, we completed a public offering in which we sold 5,000,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $2700 per share. We received
net proceeds of approximately $1275million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In
January 2008, we obtained a new equipment lease line with a borrowing capability of $1,500,000. We have the ability to draw down on this line until the end of 2008.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2007. 
The
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst YoungLLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in its attestation report. which is set forth below in this annual report on Form10K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Rigel PharmaceuticalsInc. management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In
our opinion, Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria. We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the balance sheets of Rigel Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2007 and our
report dated March6, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ERNST YOUNG LLP Palo
