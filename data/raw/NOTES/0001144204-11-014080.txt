Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements F-7  28  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apricus Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apricus Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited the adjustments described in Note 1 that were applied to restate the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements for the 15 to 1 reverse stock split. In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2009 and 2008 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. s/ EisnerAmper LLP March 10, 2011
Edison, New Jersey  F-1  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. formerly known as NexMed, Inc. We have audited, before the effects of the adjustments relating to the 15 to 1 reverse stock split,the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apricus Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 those consolidated financial statements before the effects of the adjustments discussed in Note 1 are not presented herein. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements, before the effects of the adjustments relating to the 15 to 1 reverse stock split described in Note 1, referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apricus Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the adjustments relating to the 15 to 1 reverse stock split described in Note 1 and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those adjustments were audited by EisnerAmper LLP. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations and expects to incur future losses. Further, the Company has substantial notes payable and other obligations that mature within the next 12 months. These issues raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. On December 14, 2009, the Company acquired Bio-Quant Inc., a San Diego based contract research organization. See Note 3 for further details. s/Amper, Politziner Mattia, LLP March 31, 2010

F-6  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Organization, Basis of Presentation and Liquidity Apricus Biosciences, Inc. formerly NexMed, Inc. the Company was incorporated in Nevada in 1987. On September 10, 2010, the Company held a special meeting of its stockholders. At the special meeting, the stockholders approved, by an affirmative majority vote, to change the name of the Company from NexMed, Inc. to Apricus Biosciences, Inc. The Company has historically focused its efforts on drug development using its patented drug delivery technology known as NexACT see Note 4 for descriptions of the licensing agreements relating to the Companys proprietary products. On December 14, 2009, the merger the Merger contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger the Merger Agreement dated November 20, 2009 by and among Apricus Biosciences, Inc. the Company and BQ Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub with Bio-Quant, Inc. Bio-Quant, was completed. Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired company have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company from December 14, 2009, the date of the Merger. Bio-Quant is a specialty biotech contract research organization CRO based in San Diego, California and is one of the industry most experienced CROs for non-GLP good laboratory practices in vitro and in vivo contract drug discovery and pre-clinical development services, specializing in oncology, inflammation, immunology, and metabolic diseases. Bio-Quant has clients world-wide and performs hundreds of studies a year both in in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, pharmacokinetic PK and toxicology to support pre-regulatory filing packages. The Company now operates in two segments designing and developing pharmaceutical products and providing pre-clinical CRO services through its subsidiary, Bio-Quant. The Company is currently focusing its efforts on new and patented pharmaceutical products mostly based on our patented drug delivery technology known as NexACT and leveraging the Know-How of the newly acquired CRO business to assist in our product and NexACT technology development within Bio-Quants current business operations. Through the acquisition of Bio-Quant the Company has expanded its research and development capabilities with NexACT into the areas of oncology, inflammation, immunology, and metabolic diseases. In addition, the Company is
conducting additional studies to extend the validation of the NexACT technology into the oral, subcutaneous, ocular and rectal delivery of classes of drugs for these and other indications. Additionally, the Bio-Quant CRO continues to generate revenues through performing services for outside clients in order to off-set the costs of our own internal product and technology development at Bio-Quant. The Company is also seeking commercialization partnerships for its existing pipeline products such as Vitaros, MycoVa, Femprox and Prevonco and is enhancing its business development efforts by offering potential partners clearly defined regulatory paths for our products under development. On March 2, 2010, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders to approve an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance by the Company from 8,000,000 shares to 18,000,000 shares. The proposal was approved at the special meeting and the amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State concurrently with the approval.  F-7  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Effective June21, 2010, the Company completed a reverse stock split pursuant to which each fifteen shares of Company common stock then issued and outstanding was automatically converted into one share of the Company common stock; no change was made to the per-share par value of the common stock. The authorized common stock was also proportionately reverse split by a factor of fifteen-for-one. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Additionally, at the special meeting of stockholders held on September 10, 2010, the Companys stockholders approved, by an affirmative majority vote, to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance by the Company from 18,000,000 shares to 75,000,000 shares. Liquidity The Company has experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations each year since our inception.Through December 31, 2010, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $201,240,208 and its operations have principally been financed through private placements of equity securities and debt financing.Funds raised in past periods, including approximately $8,540,000 during 2010 from the sale of common stock and units see Note 11,should not be considered an indication of our ability to raise additional funds in any future periods. The Companys current cash reserves of approximately $11 million as of the date of this report, which includes approximately $722,000 received from the exercise of warrants issued as part of our common stock and warrant offering as discussed in Note 11 and approximately $24 million, net of commissions, from the sale of approximately 613,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to Sales Agreement with Brinson Patrick Securities Corporation also discussed in Note 11, should provide the Company with sufficient cash to fund its operations into the second half of 2012.This projection is based on the monthly operating expenses of maintaining its public listing together with maintaining Bio-Quants revenue at a level consistent
with 2010.The current cash reserves also include $200,000 in up-front payments as a result of entering into exclusive license agreements with Elis Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Elis and Neopharm Group Neopharm for Vitaros.To the extent the Company signs additional licensing agreements in 2011 and receives up-front and milestone payments for one or more ofits product pipeline candidates and/or the NexACT technology itself, the Companys cash reserves would provide sufficient cash to fundoperations well into 2013. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital as may be needed, meet its projections for operating expenses or obtain additional licensing agreements.If the Company is unable to raise additional capital as may be needed, meet its projections for operating expenses or obtain additional licensing agreements, it could have a
material adverse effect on liquidity or require the Company to cease or significantly delay some of its development programs. The Company expects to be cash flow positive from operations in 2011 and 2012 as it anticipates entering into out-licensing agreements for its NexACT technology with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide.The Company is also are actively pursuing partnering opportunities for the clinical stage NexACT based and non NexACT based candidates in the areas of oncology, inflammation, dermatology, pain, autoimmune diseases and sexual dysfunction. The successful licensing of one or more of these candidates and/or the NexACT technology itself would be expected to generate additional revenues for funding current operations and the long-term growth strategy of the Company.Even if the Company
is successful in obtaining partners who can assume the funding for further development of its products, the Company may still encounter additional obstacles such as research and development activities not being successful, products may not prove to be safe and effective, clinical development work may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and the anticipated products may not be commercially viable or successfully marketed.Should the Company not be able to find development partners in 2011, it would require external financing to fund its operations and the Company may not achieve its goals of being cash flow positive from operations in 2011 and 2012.  F-8  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Principles Significant accounting principles followed by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements are as follows Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash equivalents represent all highly liquid investments with an original maturity date of three months or less. Accounts Receivable
Our policy is that an allowance is recorded for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Such allowances are computed based upon a specific customer account review of larger customers and balances in excess of 90 days old. Our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer, investigation into our customers financial status, as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. If we determine, based on our assessment, that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay, we will write-off the accounts
receivable. Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value of a financial instrument represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. Significant differences can arise between the fair value and carrying amounts of financial instruments that are recognized at historical cost amounts. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, short-term borrowings under a lines of credit, capital lease payable and deferred compensation approximates fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term convertible notes payable approximates fair value based on the relative current dates of issuance and future maturity. Fixed assets
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of equipment and furniture and fixtures is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to ten years. Depreciation of our building in East Windsor, New Jersey is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 31 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is provided on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the lease term. The costs of additions and betterments are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations in the periods incurred.  F-9  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Long-lived assets
The Company reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount. If such assets are considered impaired, the amount of the impairment loss recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, fair value being determined based upon future cash flows or appraised values, depending on the nature of the asset. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $884,271 in 2008 to reduce the carrying amount of its land and building to reflect the current
commercial real estate market, as the Company had initiated efforts to sell its East Windsor, New Jersey facility. The Company entered into a lease of this facility in December 2009 See Note 5. This charge is recorded within general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. No such impairment losses have been recorded by the Company during 2009 or 2010. Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets consists principally of the Trade Name of Bio-Quant and the Know-How acquired from Bio-Quant, which were recorded at fair value in connection with the acquisition of Bio-Quant on December 14, 2009. The Company amortizes Know-How over the expected useful life of 10 years and the Trade Name over the expected useful life of 20 years. Management evaluates the recoverability of such other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. The evaluation is based on estimates of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets. If the amount of such estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net book value of the asset, the asset is written down to fair value. As of December31, 2009, no such write-down was required. At December31, 2010, the Company has determined that the value of Know-How was partially impaired and a charge of $1,083,646 was recorded to write down the value of Know-How to $1,637,000. The decision to write down Know-How was based on an assessment of the fair value of the Bio-Quant pre-clinical CRO business segment. Such impairment was derived mainly from the fact that Bio-Quant significantly changed its strategic focus in 2010. Rather than serve the greater CRO market, Bio-Quant is primarily performing CRO services for the Companys own pharmaceutical product development segment. As such, the ongoing revenue, profits and cash flows for Bio-Quant have been significantly reduced from the initial projections for Bio-Quant when it was acquired by the Company in December
2009. Goodwill
Goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of Bio-Quant on December 14, 2009, and will be included in the CRO segment. Goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases. See Note 3. The Company follows the applicable guidance for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which requires an annual impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. The first step of the impairment test requires that the Company determine the fair value of each reporting unit, and compare the fair value to the reporting unit carrying amount. To the extent a reporting unit carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment. The second
impairment assessment involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date.  F-10  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the Company weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. The Company will perform its annual impairment test on December31 each year, unless triggering events occur that would cause the Company to test for impairment at interim periods. At December31, 2010, the Company has determined that the value of goodwill is impaired and a charge of $9,084,476 was recorded to write off the entire value of goodwill. The decision to write off the goodwill was based on an assessment of the fair value of the Bio-Quant pre-clinical CRO business segment. Such impairment was derived mainly from the fact that Bio-Quant significantly changed its strategic focus in the fourth quarter of 2010. Rather than serve the greater CRO market, Bio-Quant is primarily performing CRO services for the Companys own pharmaceutical product development segment. As such, the ongoing revenue, profits and cash flows for Bio-Quant have been significantly reduced from the initial projections for Bio-Quant when it was acquired by the Company in December
2009. Debt Issuance Costs
Amounts paid related to debt financing activities are capitalized and amortized over the term of the loan. Our expenses incurred related to the convertible notes payable are being amortized over the three-year term of the notes to interest expense on a straight-line basis which approximates the effective interest rate method. Revenue recognition
Bio-Quants revenues are derived from two sources, the delivery of pre-clinical services and the sale of diagnostic kits. Both of these sources are part of the CRO services segment. Revenues from Bio-Quants performance of pre-clinical services are recognized according to the proportional performance method whereby revenue is recognized as performance occurs, based on the relative outputs of the performance that have occurred up to that point in time under the respective agreement, typically the delivery of data to our clients on the results of the pre-clinical tests or the delivery of the formal report which documents the results of our pre-clinical testing services. Deferred revenues represent billings in advance of the recognition of revenue. When the current estimates of total contract
revenue and contract cost indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is made in the period which it becomes probable. All costs related to these agreements are expensed as incurred and classified within Cost of Services expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenues from sales of diagnostic kits are recognized upon delivery of products to customers, less allowances for estimated returns and discounts.  F-11  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Our licensing agreements typically include several elements of revenue, such as up-front payments, milestones, royalties upon sales of product, and the delivery of product and/or research services to the licensor. Non-refundable license fees received upon execution of license agreements where we have continuing involvement are deferred and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period of the agreement. This requires management to estimate the expected term of the agreement or, if applicable, the estimated life of its licensed patents. In addition, the Company evaluates its arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue-generating activities. For example, a license agreement with a pharmaceutical company may involve a license, research and development activities and/or contract manufacturing, and royalties upon commercialization of the product. Management is required to determine if the separate components of the agreement have value on a standalone basis and qualify as separate units of accounting, whereby consideration is allocated based upon their relative fair values or, if not, the consideration should be allocated based upon the residual method. Accordingly, up-front and development stage milestone payments will be deferred and recognized as revenue over the performance period of such license
agreement. There have been no royalties received during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Rental Income
Rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include the cost of salaries, building costs, utilities, allocation of indirect costs, and expenses to third parties who conduct research and development, pursuant to development and consulting agreements, on behalf of the Company. Income taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company also follows the provisions of Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes which prescribes a model for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure and transition. At December 31, 2010 and 2009 the Company did not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits. Loss per common share
Basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing income loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise or contingent exercise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect on per share amounts. At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, outstanding options to purchase 107,604, 196,713, and 224,599 shares of Common Stock, respectively, with exercise prices ranging from $169 to $24375 have been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as they are antidilutive.At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, outstanding warrants to purchase 1,675,658, 465,275, and 807,870 shares of Common Stock, respectively, with exercise prices ranging from $227 to $6060 have also been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as they are antidilutive.Promissory notes convertible into 640,000, 99,667 and 156,333 shares of Common Stock in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively have also been excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, as they are antidilutive.  F-12  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Accounting for stock based compensation
The value of restricted stock grants are calculated based upon the closing stock price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of the grant.For stock options granted to employees and directors, we recognize compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance, and recognized over the expected service period. We estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock options and warrants issued to consultants are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance. Compensation expense is calculated each quarter for consultants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model until the option is fully vested and is included in research and development or general and
administrative facility expenses, based upon the services performed by the recipient. Additional disclosures required under FASB ASC 718, Stock Compensation are presented in Note 13. Concentration of credit risk
From time to time, the Company maintains cash in bank accounts that exceed the FDIC insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash accounts. The Companys credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited, in that the CRO segment serves a large number of customers, none of which is individually in excess of 10% of the revenues of the segment.We perform credit evaluations of our customers, but generally do not require collateral to support accounts receivable. Accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.The Companys most significant estimates relate to the valuation of its long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets, whether revenue recognition criteria have been met, estimated cost to complete under its research contracts, whether beneficial conversion features exist under convertible financing instruments, and valuation allowances for its deferred tax benefit.Actual results may differ from those estimates. Recent accounting pronouncements
In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Topic 605 - Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method USA 2010-17, which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions. The amendments in ASU 2010-17 are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted; however, if a Company elects to early adopt, the amendment must be applied retrospectively from the beginning of the year of adoption. The Company has adopted ASU 2010-17 effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year ended January 1, 2011 but due to non-activity of any applicable transactions,
it is not expected to impact the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.  F-13 
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   3. Acquisition On November 20, 2009, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Bio-Quant. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on December 14, 2009 the Effective Time, each outstanding share of common stock of Bio-Quant was canceled and converted into the right to receive 6093 shares of common stock, par value $0001 per share, of the Company the NexMed Shares, as well as a promissory note each, a Note in the original principal amount of $2,77137.In connection with the closing of the Merger, the Company issued an aggregate of 266,667 NexMed Shares and Notes in the aggregate original principal amount of $12,129,010 to the shareholders of Bio-Quant. The Notes accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum through their repayment, with all principal and interest accrued thereunder becoming due and payable one year from the closing date of the Merger.The terms of the Notes provide that the principal amounts and all interest thereunder were payable by the Company in cash or, at the Companys option, in NexMed Shares, which would be valued at the fixed price of $252 per share.The Merger Agreement provides that if the Company repaid the Notes in NexMed Shares, the total number of NexMed Shares issuable to Bio-Quant shareholders could not exceed 1999% of outstanding NexMed Shares at the Effective Time unless the Company received stockholder approval to do so in accordance with applicable rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market.The
Company received stockholder approval at its May 24, 2010 meeting for the potential issuance of shares in full repayment of the remaining amounts owed under the Notes, and, on June 21, 2010, the Company repaid the remaining outstanding principal and interest accrued under the Notes in NexMed Shares. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting under FASB ASC 805 Business Combinations, The Company has determined that it is the accounting acquirer in this transaction, as it meets the predominance of the factors outlined in FASB ASC 805.Accordingly, the results of operations of the acquired company have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company from the date of the Merger. The total consideration was estimated to be approximately $137 million as of December 14, 2009, the date the Merger was consummated, as follows in thousands Fair value of266,667 shares of common stock issued for Bio-Quant common stock 1,600 Fair value ofpromissory notes issued for Bio-Quant common stock 12,129 Total consideration 13,729 The fair value of the shares of Apricus Biosciences common stock issued was based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on December 14, 2009, the date the Merger was consummated, or $600 per share. The purchase price was allocated based on the estimated fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Merger. An allocation of the purchase price was made to major categories of assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet based on managements best estimates. The fair value of the other current assets and assumed liabilities were estimated by management based upon the relative short term nature of the accounts and the fair value of the machinery and equipment was established based upon expected replacement costs.  F-14 
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair value of Bio-Quants tangible and identifiable intangible assets were determined based on this analysis.The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to goodwill. 
Accordingly, the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities of Bio-Quant as presented below in thousands Cash cash equivalents 151 Accounts receivable 576 Prepaids and other current assets 105 Other assets 26 Property and equipment 783 Due from related party 205 Accounts payableand accrued expenses 1,041 Related party payable 85 Deferred revenue 45 Other current liabilities 68 Other long term liabilities 122 Amortizable intangible assets Know-How 3,037 Trade Name 1,123 Indefinite lived intangible assets Goodwill 9,084 Total net assets acquired 13,729 Intangible assets of $4,160,000 consist primarily of developed Know-How and the Bio-Quant Trade Name. Developed Know-How relates to Bio-Quants pre-clinical service expertise including, but not limited to, its extensive inventory of internally developed cell lines. The Bio-Quant Trade Name represents future revenue attributable to the reputation and name recognition of Bio-Quant within the pharmaceutical industry where Bio-Quant is a known expert in pre-clinical services. At the time of acquisition, Bio-Quant was a revenue generating, cash flow positive CRO.Bio-Quant was expected to continue its revenue growth and cash generating CRO business.The $9,084,476 of goodwill generated from the acquisition of Bio-Quant consisted largely of the ability of the Bio-Quant CRO to continue to grow its revenues and generate positive cash flow to contribute to the pharmaceutical product development business segment of the Company.As discussed in Note 2, the Company has shifted the focus of the Bio-Quant CRO from growing revenues and generating increased positive cash flow to largely supporting the Companys research and development business segment which designs and develops pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, based on a valuation of the goodwill at December 31, 2010, an impairment charge of $9,084,476 was taken in 2010 to write off the entire value of goodwill. Costs associated with the merger of $585,378 were expensed for the year ended December 31, 2009.  F-15

On December 22, 2010, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with Bracco Bracco for its topical alprostadil-based cream treatment for erectile dysfunction Vitaros.Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Bracco has been granted exclusive rights in Italy to commercialize and market Vitaros under the Bracco trademark, and the Company will receive 750,000 as an up-front payment and is entitled to receive up to EURO 475 million in regulatory and sales milestone payments.Further, over the life of the agreement, the Company will receive royalties based on Bracco sales of the product.The 750,000 up-front payment will be paid when the
Company provides IRS Form 6166, Certification of U.S. Tax Residency, to Bracco which is expected to occur in early 2011.When paid, the 750,000 payment will be deferred until the Company files the application for marketing authorization in one country in the European Union at which time the 750,000 up-front payment will begin to be recognized as revenue pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement. Vitaros 2007 2009 On November 1, 2007, the Company signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Warner Chilcott Company, Inc., Warner for Vitaros.Under the agreement, Warner acquired the exclusive rights in the United States to Vitaros and would assume all further development, manufacturing, and commercialization responsibilities as well as costs.Warner agreed to pay the Company an up- front payment of $500,000 and up to $125 million in milestone payments on the achievement of specific regulatory milestones.
F-16 
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  The Company has recognized the initial up-front payment as revenue on a straight line basis over the nine month period ended July 31, 2008 which was the remaining review time by the FDA for the Companys new drug application filed in September 2007 for Vitaros.Pursuant to the agreement, NexMed was responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of Vitaros. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company recognized licensing revenue of $388,889 and $111,111, respectively, related to the Warner agreement. On February 3, 2009, the Company terminated the licensing agreement and sold the U.S. rights for Vitarosto Warner.Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company received an up-front payment of $25 million and is eligible to receive an additional payment of $25 million upon Warners receipt of a New Drug Application NDA approval for Vitarosfrom the FDA.As such, the Company is no longer responsible for obtaining regulatory approval of Vitarosand will no longer be eligible to receive royalties in the future based upon the level of sales achieved by Warner.In addition, Warner has paid the Company a total of $350,000 for the manufacturing equipment for Vitaros.and recognized a gain of $43,840. While the Company believes that Warner is currently moving forward in pursuing NDA approval for Vitaros, Warner is not obligated by the Asset Purchase Agreement to continue with the development of Vitaros or obtain approval of Vitaros from the FDA. The Company allocated $2,398,000 of the $2,500,000 purchase price to the U.S. rights for
Vitarosand the related patents acquired by Warner.The balance of $102,000 was allocated to the rights of certain technology based patents which Warner licensed as part of the sale of U.S. rights for Vitaros.The $2,398,000 was recognized as revenue in year ended December 31, 2009, as the Company has no continuing obligations or rights with respect to Vitaros in the U.S. market.The $102,000 allocated to the patent license is being recognized over a period of ten years, the estimated useful commercial life of the patents.Accordingly, $10,200 and $9,350 was recognized as revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.The balance of $82,450 and $92,650 is recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On April 15, 2009, the Company entered into a First Amendment the Amendment to the Asset Purchase Agreement.The Amendment provided that from May 15, 2009 through September 15, 2009, the Company would permit certain representatives of Warner access to and use of the Companys manufacturing facility for the purpose of manufacturing Vitaros, and in connection therewith the Company would provide reasonable technical and other assistance to Warner.In consideration, Warner would pay to the Company a fee of $50,000 per month, or $200,000 in the aggregate which was recognized as revenue in 2009. MycoVa 2005 -2009 On September 15, 2005, the Company signed an exclusive global licensing agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd. Novartis for its anti-fungal product, MycoVa.Under the agreement, Novartis acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to MycoVa and would assume all further development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities as well as costs.Novartis agreed to pay the Company up to $51 million in upfront and milestone payments on the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones, including an initial cash payment of $4 million at signing.In addition, the Company was eligible to receive royalties based upon the level of sales achieved and to receive reimbursements of third party preclinical study costs up to $325
million.The Company began recognizing the initial up- front and preclinical reimbursement revenue from this agreement based on the cost-to-cost method over the 32-month period estimated to complete the remaining preclinical studies for MycoVa.On February 16, 2007, the Novartis agreement was amended.Pursuant to the amendment, the Company was no longer obligated to complete the remaining preclinical studies for MycoVa.Novartis took over all responsibilities and completed the remaining preclinical studies.As such, the balance of deferred revenue of $1,693,917 at December 31, 2006 was recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the 18 month period ended June 30, 2008 which was the performance period for Novartis to complete the remaining preclinical studies. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2008 the Company recognized licensing revenue of$1,129,276 related to the initial $4 million
cash payment from the Novartis agreement.  F-17 
Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements On March 4, 2008, the Company received a $15 million milestone payment from Novartis pursuant to the terms of the licensing agreement whereby the payment was due seven months after the completion of patient enrollment for the Phase 3 clinical trials for MycoVa, which occurred in July 2007.Although the completion of patient enrollment in the Phase 3 clinical trials for MycoVa triggered a $3 million milestone payment from Novartis, the agreement also provided that clinical milestones paid to us by Novartis shall be reduced by 50% until the Company receives an approved patent claim on the MycoVapatent application filed with the U.S. patent office in November 2004.The $15 million milestone payment was recognized on a straight-line basis over the six month period to
complete the Phase 3 clinical trial, and therefore the $15 million milestone payment was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2008. In July 2008, Novartis completed testing for the Phase 3 clinical trials for MycoVa required for the filing of the NDA in the U.S.On August 26, 2008, the Company announced that Novartis had decided not to submit the NDA in the U.S. based on First Interpretable Results of the Phase 3 trials. On October 17, 2008, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for its U.S. patent covering MycoVa. Pursuant to the license agreement, the payment of the issuance fee for an approved patent claim on MycoVa triggered the $2 million patent milestone payment from Novartis. Additionally, $15 million, which represents the remaining 50% of the patient enrollment milestone also became due and payable. As such the Company received a payment of $35 million from Novartis on October 30, 2008 and recognized it as licensing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008. In total, the Company recognized $5,564,639 of revenue related to the Novartis agreements for the year ended December 31, 2008. In July 2009, Novartis completed final analysis of the comparator study which they had initiated in March 2007 in ten European countries. The study results were insufficient to support marketing approval in Europe. As such, on July 8, 2009, the Company announced the mutual decision reached with Novartis to terminate the licensing agreement. Accordingly, pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Novartis has provided the Company reports associated with the Phase III clinical trials conducted for MycoVa. In consideration for providing the reports associated with the Phase III clinical trials, the Company will pay to Novartis 15% of any upfront and/or milestone payments that it receives from any future third party licensee of MycoVa, as well as a royalty fee ranging from 28% to 65% of annual net sales of products developed from MycoVa collectively, Products, with such royalty fee varying based on volume of such annual net sales. In the event that the Company, or a substantial part of its assets, is sold, the Company will pay to Novartis 15% of any upfront and/or milestone payments received by the Company or its successor relating to the Products, as well as a royalty fee ranging from 3% to 65% of annual net sales of any Products, with such royalty fee varying based on volume of such annual
net sales. If the acquirer makes no upfront or milestone payments, the royalty fees payable to Novartis will range from 4% to 65% of annual net sales of any Products. No such fees have been paid to date.  F-18

Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
The Company is currently amortizing Know-How over the expected useful life of 10 years and the Trade Name over the expected useful life of 20 years. Amortization expense amounted to $359,848 and $14,994 for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.Additionally, as discussed in Note 2, the Company has taken an impairment charge of $1,083,646 to write down the fair value of Know-How to $1,637,000.Such impairment was derived mainly from the fact that Bio-Quant significantly changed its strategic focus in 2010.Rather than serve the greater CRO market, Bio-Quant is primarily performing CRO services for the Companys own pharmaceutical product development segment.As such, the ongoing revenue, profits and cash flows for Bio-Quant have been
significantly reduced from the initial projections for Bio-Quant when it was acquired by the Company in December 2009. Based on the current carrying amount of intangible assets, assuming no future impairment of underlying assets, the estimated future amortization expense for the next five years ended December 31 and thereafter is as follows 2011 238,039 2012 238,039 2013 238,039 2014 238,039 2015 238,039 Thereafter 1,511,317 
Total future amortization expense 2,701,512 7. Deferred Compensation On February 27, 2002, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Y. Joseph Mo, Ph.D., that had a constant term of five years, and pursuant to which Dr. Mo served as the Company Chief Executive Officer and President.Under the employment agreement, Dr. Mo is entitled to deferred compensation in an annual amount equal to one sixth of the sum of his base salary and bonus for the 36 calendar months preceding the date on which the deferred compensation payments commence subject to certain limitations, including a vesting requirement through the date of termination, as set forth in the employment agreement.The deferred compensation is payable monthly for 180 months commencing on termination of employment.Dr. Mos employment was terminated as of December 15, 2005 and
the present value of the vested portion of the obligation was recognized.The monthly deferred compensation payment through May 15, 2021 will be $9,158.As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company has accrued$874,384 and $935,602respectively, which is included in deferred compensation in the consolidated balance sheets. 8. Convertible Notes Payable 2010 Convertible Notes On March 15, 2010, the Company issued convertible notes the 2010 Convertible Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4 million to the holders of the 2008 Convertible Notes discussed below.The 2010 Convertible Notes are secured by the Companys facility in East Windsor, New Jersey and are due on December 31, 2012.The proceeds were used to repay the 2008 Convertible Notes then outstanding as discussed below.As such, the Company received approximately $14 million in net proceeds from the issuance of the 2010 Convertible Notes.
F-20 
Apricus Biosciences, Inc.

The Company uses analysis of historical volatility to compute the expected volatility of its stock options.  F-26  Apricus Biosciences, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Expected Term. The expected term is based on several factors including historical observations of employee exercise patterns during the Companys history and expectations of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards. Risk-Free Interest Rate. The interest rate used in valuing awards is based on the yield at the time of grant of a U.S. Treasury security with an equivalent remaining term. Dividend Yield.

The Company will adjust its estimate of forfeitures over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates.

Income Taxes The Company has incurred losses since inception, which have generated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $36 million for federal and state income tax purposes, net of approximately $80 million subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 382.These carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income and expire beginning in 2014 through 2029 for federal income tax purposes.Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places a limitation on the utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards when an ownership change, as defined by tax law, occurs.Generally, an ownership change, as defined, occurs when a greater than 50 percent change in ownership takes place during any three-year period. The Company performed a review of stock transactions for the
years beginning January 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2010 as the Company feels that was the likely period that such an ownership change likely occurred.Based on this limited review, the Company determined that an ownership change took place in June 2010 when the Bio-Quant notes were converted to common stock as discussed in Note 9.The Company may have had other ownership changes and additional limitations that would be revealed if a more detailed review is performed. As a result of this ownership change, the ability to utilize the current net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to this change in ownership is limited to approximately $12 million per year based on our calculations at the time of the ownership change.As such, the Company cannot utilize approximately $80 million of the net operating loss carryforwards and all of its $25 million research and development tax credit carryforwards that exist at December 31, 2010 due to
the expiration of such loss carryforwardsbefore they are available for use. In 2008 and 2009,the Company was approved by the State of New Jersey to sell a portion of its state tax credits pursuant to the Technology Tax Certificate Transfer Program.The Company no longer has any significant NJ tax credit benefits left available to sell at December 31, 2010, and was approved to sell net operating loss tax benefits of $491,903 in 2009 and $1,053,547 in 2008.The Company generated net revenues of $437,794 and $937,657 in 2009 and 2008 as a result of the sale of the tax credits, which has been recognized as received as an income tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The acquisition of Bio-Quant was the acquisition of the stock of Bio-Quant.Therefore, the Company does not have the amortizable tax bases in the intangible assets. The Company followsthe provisions of ASC 740-10-25. ASC 740-10-25 provides recognition criteria and a related measurement model for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. ASC 740-10-25 requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold are then measured using a probability weighted approach recognizing the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Companys Federal income tax returns for 2007 to 2009 are still open and subject to audit.In addition, net operating
losses arising from prior years are also subject to examination at the time they are utilized in future years. The Company had no tax positions relating to open income tax returns that were considered to be uncertain. Accordingly, we have not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits upon adoption of ASC 740-10-25. There continues to be no liability related to unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The reconciliation of income taxes computed using the statutory U.S. income tax rate and the provision benefit for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows  F-32  Apricus Biosciences, Inc.
