REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Company as of December31,
2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at December31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s internal control over financial
reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March8, 2012 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.  September 30 Vancouver, Canada s/ERNSTYOUNGLLP March8, 2012 Chartered Accountants  72 Table of Contents
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We have audited OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated
balance sheets of the Company as of December31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of loss, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2011 and our report
dated March8, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.  September 30 Vancouver, Canada s/ERNSTYOUNGLLP March8, 2012 Chartered Accountants  73 Table of Contents

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the Company or OncoGenex is committed to the development and
commercialization of new therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. The Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware and, together with its subsidiaries, has a facility in Bothell, Washington and an office in Vancouver,
British Columbia Canada. During the year ended December31, 2009, the Company exited the development stage. Previously from its
inception, the Company was a development stage company in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 915, Accounting and Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises. Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries, OncoGenex Technologies and
OncoGenex, Inc. OncoGenex, Inc. ceased operations in 2009 and were subsequently dissolved. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Liquidity The Company has historically experienced recurring losses from operations that
have generated an accumulated deficit of $807 million through December31, 2011. At December31, 2011, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $649 million. 
2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Estimates and assumptions principally relate to the period we expect to recognize our remaining Current Deferred Collaboration Revenue under our Collaboration and License Agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with Teva, estimates of the
initial fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and estimates of the fair value of our excess lease facility liability. 
Cash Equivalents We consider all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents, which we consider as available for sale and are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses, if any, reported as accumulated other
comprehensive income or loss, which is a separate component of shareholders equity deficiency. Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than
one year. We consider our short-term investments as available-for-sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses except other than temporary losses, if any, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss,
which is a separate component of shareholders equity deficiency. Realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss. The cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method.
78 Table of Contents
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities. The Company determines the fair value of its warrant liability
based on the Black-Scholes pricing model and using considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life. Other financial instruments including amounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, are
carried at cost, which we believe approximates fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. Intellectual Property
The costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development process, including licensing fees and
milestone payments, are charged to research and development expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an alternative future use for the acquired rights, and are capitalized in situations where it has identified an alternative
future use. No costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized to date. Costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront
payment we received in the fourth quarter of 2009 pursuant to our Collaboration Agreement with Teva, as well as cash reimbursements from Teva for certain costs incurred by us under the Clinical Development Plan we and Teva developed under which
three phase 3 clinical trials will be initiated. Under the Collaboration Agreement, we and Teva share certain custirsen-related development costs. We are required to spend $30 million in direct and indirect development costs, such as full-time
equivalent FTE reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the custirsen development plan, such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided by Teva as an advanced reimbursement for the Company Development
Expenses, or reimbursed to OncoGenex on a cash basis. Teva will fund all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan. When we have fulfilled its requirement to spend $30 million in direct and indirect development costs, including FTEs, Teva
will, on a quarterly basis, reimburse all development expenses incurred in accordance with the Clinical Development Plan. Our policy is to account for these reimbursements as Collaboration Revenue. For a summary description of the Collaboration
Agreement, see Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Collaboration
Agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables, and requires evaluation pursuant to ASC 605-25, Multiple-Element Arrangements, or ASC 605-25. We evaluated the facts and circumstances of the Collaboration Agreement to determine whether
it had obligations constituting deliverables under ASC 605-25. We concluded that it had multiple deliverables under the Collaboration Agreement, including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license, and performance of manufacturing,
regulatory and clinical development services in the U.S. and Canada, and estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of 2009 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Because we were
able to establish vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of the fair value of the maintenance, regulatory, and clinical services, we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under ASC 605-25. In
establishing VSOE for the manufacturing, regulatory, and clinical development services, management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services. We will recognize $30 million allocated to the manufacturing, regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue on a proportional performance basis, as we incur direct and indirect
development costs under the Collaboration Agreement. As the direct and indirect costs associated with the Clinical Development plan are incurred and the associated revenue is recognized, the Current Deferred Collaboration Revenue balance is reduced.
Management currently expects that all remaining Current Deferred Collaboration Revenue will be in recognized as Collaboration Revenue by the fourth quarter of 2012. Estimation of the period we expect to incur direct and indirect costs associated
with the Clinical Development Plan requires the use of managements judgment. Significant factors considered in managements evaluation of the direct and indirect development costs include, but are not limited to
79 Table of Contents
its experience, along with Tevas experience, in conducting clinical development activities. We will review the projected direct and indirect development costs associated with the Clinical
Development Plan on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis. Future changes in estimates of the total direct and indirect development costs may materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under
the Collaboration Agreement. Direct and indirect development costs consists primarily of time recognized as hours incurred, multiplied by contractual billing rates, materials and other related costs. 
Because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license, it used the residual value approach to determine the amount
of revenue to recognize. Based on this approach, we recognized $22 million in 2009 relating to this element. Under the Collaboration
Agreement, we are entitled to receive up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones. Management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted
substantive milestones. This conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables, and that achievement
of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us. Management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive, based primarily on the facts that the payments they
trigger are non-refundable, that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the Collaboration Agreement, that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone, that the amount of each milestone
payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone, that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments, and that the milestone payments, once
received, relate solely to past performance. Based on the foregoing, we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs. 
Under the Collaboration Agreement, we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of custirsen ranging from the mid-teens to the
mid-twenties. We will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Based on those criteria, we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue, and will
recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved. Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense on assets acquired under capital lease is recorded
within depreciation expense. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the following periods:  September 30 Computer equipment
3years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Leasehold improvements and equipment under capital lease
Overthetermofthelease
Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective
income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
the enacted tax rates and laws. 
80 Table of Contents
Scientific Research and Development Tax Credits 
The benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided
there is reasonable assurance of recoverability. The tax credits recorded are based on managements estimates of amounts expected to be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities. The non-refundable tax credit reduces the tax
provision; however, no reduction to the tax provision has been recorded to date as we record a full valuation allowance. All qualifying expenditures are eligible for non-refundable tax credits only. 
Therapeutic Discovery Research Grants 
The Internal Revenue Services therapeutic discovery tax credit program, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010,
provides tax credits or grants representing up to 50 percent of eligible qualified investments in therapeutic discovery projects during tax years 2009 and 2010. We applied for and received funds under this program to support the companys
custirsen, and OGX-427 development projects. The benefits of research grants under the Internal Revenue Services therapeutic discovery tax credit program are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is approved provided there is
reasonable assurance of recoverability. The tax grants recorded are based on managements estimates of amounts expected to be received and are subject to audit by taxation authorities. The research grants reduce the carrying cost of
expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates. Research and Development Costs 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, net of related refundable investment tax credits, with the exception of non-refundable advanced
payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development, which are capitalized in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development and included within Prepaid Expenses. 
Clinical trial expenses are a component of research and development costs. These expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and
investigators and other service providers, which conduct certain product development activities on our behalf. We use an accrual basis of accounting, based upon estimates of the amount of service completed. In the event payments differ from the
amount of service completed, prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance sheet. These expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements, milestones achieved, patient enrollment and
experience with similar contracts. We monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly. Stock-Based
Compensation Effective January1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the ASC 718, Stock
Compensation, using the modified prospective method with respect to options granted to employees and directors. Under this transition method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date for all
share-based payments granted after January1, 2006 and for all awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of January1, 2006. The expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the graded vesting period. 
Segment Information We follow the
requirements of ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We have one operating segment, dedicated to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies, with operations located in Canada and the United States. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss. Other comprehensive income loss consists of
unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities. We have reported the components of comprehensive loss in the statement of shareholders equity. 
81 Table of Contents
Loss per Common Share Basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock
method. The effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding stock options is anti-dilutive for all periods presented. 
Warrants We account for warrants
pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a companys own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the warrants
require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and therefore do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement. We classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance
sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life.
The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively
large change in the estimated valuation. We use the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrants. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on revaluation of warrants.
Reclassifications Certain
prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The expenses associated with adjustments to sublease income assumptions relating to our Bothell facility please see Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were reclassified during the third quarter of 2010 from research and development expenses to restructuring expenses. This reclassification on the statements of loss was made
in all prior periods presented for comparability purposes. This reclassification had no effect on net loss attributable to common shareholders, shareholders equity, total assets and total liabilities, or the major categories of the cash flow
statement. Recently Adopted Accounting Policies In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No201017Revenue RecognitionMilestone Method Topic 605: Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition. This
standard provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for certain research and development transactions. Under this new standard, a company can recognize
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved as long as the milestone is considered substantive according to the criteria set forth in this new standard. The Company
adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter ended March31, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
In January 2010, the FASB issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures. The new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding
fair value measurements, amends disclosures about post-retirement benefit plan assets, and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class. This guidance is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December15, 2009, except for certain Level 3 activity disclosure requirements that are effective for reporting periods beginning after December15, 2010. Accordingly, we adopted this amendment in the
quarter ended March31, 2010, while the additional Level 3 requirements were adopted in the quarter ended March31, 2011. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements In
December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-12, Comprehensive Income. This ASU defers the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in ASU
No2011-05. The amendments are being made to allow the Board time to redeliberate whether to present on 
82 Table of Contents
the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods
presented. While the Board is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments,
entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before Update 2011-05. All other requirements in Update 2011-05 are not affected by this Update, including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but
consecutive financial statements. Public entities are required to apply these requirements for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December15, 2011. Nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements
for fiscal years ending after December15, 2012, and interim and annual periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new ASU. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-05, Comprehensive Income. This ASU intends to enhance comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components. The guidance
provides an option to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements. This ASU eliminates the option to
present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareowners equity. The provisions of this ASU will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. Early
application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new ASU. In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU No2011-04,
Fair Value Measurement. This ASU clarifies the concepts related to highest and best use and valuation premise, blockage factors and other premiums and discounts, the fair value measurement of financial instruments held in a portfolio and
of those instruments classified as a component of shareowners equity. The guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements, the use of nonfinancial assets, and the level in the fair value
hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value. The provisions of this ASU are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2011. Early application is prohibited. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this new ASU. 
3. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK 
For certain of the Companys financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable, and accounts payable
carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. The Companys cash equivalents and short-term investments are recorded at fair value. Financial risk is the risk to the Companys results of operations that arises from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and the degree of volatility of these rates as well as
credit risk associated with the financial stability of the issuers of the financial instruments. Foreign exchange rate risk arises as a portion of the Companys investments which finance operations and a portion of the Companys expenses
are denominated in other than U.S. dollars. The Company invests its excess cash in accordance with investment guidelines, which limit the
credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporation other than securities issued by the U.S. government. The Company only invests in A or equivalent rated securities with maturities of one year or less. These securities generally
mature within one year or less and in some cases are not collateralized. At December31, 2011 the average days to maturity of the Companys portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities was 131 days December 31, 2010172
days. The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge against any of these financial risks. 
4. COLLABORATION AGREEMENT 
On December20, 2009, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies, entered into a Collaboration
Agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., or Teva, for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds, a pharmaceutical compound designed to inhibit the production of clusterin, a protein we believe is
associated with cancer treatment resistance, or the Licensed Product. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva paid the Company upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50 
83 Table of Contents
million and has agreed to pay up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid-teens to mid-twenties on
net sales, depending on aggregate annual net sales of the Licensed Product. Teva also acquired $10 million of our common stock at a premium under a separate Stock Purchase Agreement. On the same date, the Company and Teva also entered into a stock purchase agreement, or Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which Teva made an additional $10 million equity investment in the Company at
a 20% premium to a thirty-day average closing price, resulting in the issuance of 267,531 of our common shares purchased at a price of $3738 per share. The 20% share premium was included as consideration for the custirsen license and has been
included in collaboration revenue. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between the Company
and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Isis, relating to custirsen, the Company paid Isis $10 million which was recorded as research and development expense in 2009. The Company also paid approximately $333,333 to the University of British Columbia, or
UBC, pursuant to the terms of their license agreement relating to custirsen, which has been recorded as research and development expense in 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the Company anticipates that it would be required to pay third
parties 31% of any milestone payments that are not based on a percentage of net sales of the Licensed Product. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company anticipates it will pay royalties to third-parties of 488% to 800% of net sales,
unless the Companys royalties are adjusted for competition from generic compounds, in which case royalties to third parties will also be subject to adjustment on a country-by-country basis. Certain third-party royalties are tiered based on the
royalty rate received by the Company. Minimum royalty rates payable by the Company assume certain third-party royalties are not paid at the time that the Licensed Product is marketed due to the expiration of patents held by such third parties.
Maximum royalty rates assume all third-party royalty rates currently in effect continue in effect at the time the Licensed Product is marketed. No milestones were due in 2011. Teva has the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds. The Company has an option to co-promote any Licensed Product in the
United States and Canada. Teva is responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to the
Companys co-promotion option, except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization. On March 6, 2012, OncoGenex Technologies and
Teva entered into an amendment to the Collaboration Agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement Amendment. Under the Collaboration Agreement Amendment, OncoGenex Technologies and Teva revised the clinical development plan, or Amended Clinical
Development Plan, under which the following three phase 3 clinical trials have been or are expected to be initiated:  The ongoing phase 3 clinical trial, referred to as the Synergy trial, or SYNERGY, to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with
first-line docetaxel treatment in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC.  A phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel treatment as second-line chemotherapy in patients
with CRPC.  A phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first-line chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer, or NSCLC. Teva will be responsible for conducting any other studies and development work necessary to obtain
required regulatory approvals. The Company may assume some of these activities if assigned by the joint steering committee. Teva will be responsible for all such costs. The joint steering committee will oversee the development and regulatory
approval of any Licensed Product. The Company may terminate its participation in the joint steering committee at any time. Funding
responsibilities for the Clinical Development Plan will be allocated as follows:  The Company will be required to spend $30 million in direct and indirect development costs, and  Teva will fund all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan. 
84 Table of Contents
The Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of
the obligation of Teva to pay royalties on sales of the Licensed Product in such country or earlier termination under its terms. After the completion of all three phase 3 clinical trials set forth in the Clinical Development Plan, or upon early
termination due to a material adverse change in the Companys patent rights related to custirsen or safety issues or futility as defined in the Collaboration Agreement, Teva may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at its sole
discretion upon three months notice if notice is given prior to regulatory approval of a Licensed Product and upon six months notice if notice is given after such regulatory approval. If Teva terminates the Collaboration Agreement for
any reasons other than an adverse change in custirsen patent rights, safety issues or futility determination as previously described, it will remain responsible for paying for any remaining costs of all three phase 3 clinical trials,
except for specified development expenses that are the responsibility of the Company. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy of either party. If the
Collaboration Agreement is terminated by the Company for other than an uncured material breach by Teva, the Company will pay Teva a royalty on sales of Licensed Products. The percentage rates of such royalties which are in the single digits vary
depending on whether termination occurs prior to the first regulatory approval in the United States or a primary European Market or after one of these approvals. These royalties would expire on a country-by-country basis on the earlier of ten years
after the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product or certain thresholds related to generic competition. In the event of a change of
control of the Company, within 90 days of the change of control, Teva may terminate the joint steering committee at its sole discretion, terminate the co-promotion option at its sole discretion if the option has not been exercised by the Company or,
if exercised, but not yet executed by the Company, or terminate the co-promotion option if in its commercially reasonable opinion co-promotion with the Companys successor would be materially detrimental to Tevas interests. 
Upon entering into the Collaboration Agreement, the Company assessed whether withholding taxes were owed to the Israeli Tax Authority, or ITA, resulting
from the Collaboration Agreement. It was the Companys position that withholdings taxes were not owed, and a claim was issued to the ITA accordingly. For accounting purposes, management concluded that the withholdings tax claim was an uncertain
tax position, and $3 million, which represented the potential withholdings tax obligation, once received from Teva was initially recorded as restricted cash pending the ITA review of our claim and a corresponding liability of $3 million was included
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. In June 2010, the Company received approval from the ITA for our request for a withholdings tax exemption on amounts received from Teva in relation to the Collaboration Agreement. Following receipt of
this approval from the ITA the $3 million was released to the Company from escrow. Subsequently, the Company released the $3 million liability and recorded a $3 million income tax recovery in the second quarter of 2010. 
Revenue for the year ended December31, 2011 was $55 million, which consists of partial recognition of deferred collaboration revenue representing
OncoGenexs contribution to the custirsen phase 3 development plan under our Collaboration Agreement with Teva and custirsen manufacturing costs and certain other preclinical and clinical trial costs incurred by OncoGenex in the year ended
December31, 2011 that are reimbursable from Teva on a cash basis. At December31, 2011, a remaining balance of $183 million of the up-front payment was recorded in deferred collaboration revenue, and $04 million realting to revenue
reimbursable on a cash basis is included in Amounts Receivable. There were $136 million in revenue recorded in the year ended December31, 2010 as a result of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva. 
Amendment to Isis and UBC License Agreements To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement, the Company and Isis agreed to amend the Isis License Agreement and the Company and UBC agreed to amend the UBC License
Agreement, in each case, effective December19 and December20, 2009, respectively. The amendment to the Isis License Agreement
provides, among other things, that if the Company is the subject of a change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product, then ia
milestone payment of $20 million will be due and payable to 
85 Table of Contents
Isis 21 days following the first commercial sale of the product in the United States; and iiunless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable
to Isis by the Company has been established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the Isis License Agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the
$20 million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10 million milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration Agreement, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10
million. As the Company has now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if Teva acquires the Company and is the surviving company. If the $30 million in advanced
reimbursement of development activities has not been spent by OncoGenex prior to the third anniversary of the Collaboration Agreement between OncoGenex and Teva, OncoGenex will pay Isis an amount equal to 30% of any un-spent portion less $35
million. 
5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
With the adoption of ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, beginning January1, 2008, assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value in the balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. For certain of the Companys financial instruments including amounts
receivable and accounts payable the carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of
valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. In accordance with ASC 820, these inputs are summarized in the three broad level listed below:  Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.  Level 2 Other significant observable inputs that are observable through corroboration with market data including quoted prices in active
markets for similar securities.  Level 3 Significant unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability. As quoted prices in active markets are not readily available for certain financial instruments, the Company
obtains estimates for the fair value of financial instruments through independent pricing service providers. In determining the appropriate
levels, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820. The Company invests its excess
cash in accordance with investment guidelines that limit the credit exposure to any one financial institution other than securities issued by the U.S. Government. Our securities are not collateralized and mature within one year. 
A description of the valuation techniques applied to the Companys financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis follows.
Financial Instruments 
Cash Significant amounts of cash are
held on deposit with large well established Canadian and U.S. financial institutions. U.S. Government and Agency Securities
U.S. Government Securities U.S. government securities are valued using quoted market prices. Valuation adjustments are not
applied. Accordingly, U.S. government securities are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
86 Table of Contents
U.S. Agency Securities U.S. agency securities are comprised of two main categories consisting of
callable and non-callable agency issued debt securities. Non-callable agency issued debt securities are generally valued using quoted market prices. Callable agency issued debt securities are valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted
market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. Actively traded non-callable agency issued debt securities are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Callable agency issued debt securities are categorized in Level 2
of the fair value hierarchy. Corporate and Other Debt Corporate Bonds and Commercial Paper The fair value of corporate bonds and commercial paper is estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations where observable, bond
spreads or credit default swap spreads adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments. The spread data used are for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that reference
a comparable issuer are used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single name credit default swap spreads and recovery rates based on collateral values as
significant inputs. Corporate bonds and commercial paper are generally categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; in instances where prices, spreads or any of the other aforementioned key inputs are unobservable, they are categorized in
Level 3 of the hierarchy. The following table presents information about our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques we utilized to determine such fair value:  September 30 September 30 September 30 September 30 in thousands

All securities included in cash, and cash equivalents have maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. All
securities included in short-term investments have maturities of within one year of the balance sheet date. 
88 Table of Contents
All of the marketable securities held as of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 had maturities
of one year or less. The Company only invests in A or equivalent rated securities with maturities of one year or less. The Company does not believe that there are any other than temporary impairments related to its investment in marketable
securities at December31, 2011, given the quality of the investment portfolio, its short-term nature, and subsequent proceeds collected on sale of securities that reached maturity. As of December31, 2011, the Company recorded a $79 million warrant liability. The Company reassesses the fair value of the common stock warrants at each reporting date utilizing a Black-Scholes
pricing model. Inputs used in the pricing model include estimates of stock price volatility, expected warrant life and risk-free interest rate. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies
from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization. The following table presents the changes in fair value

On August21, 2008, Sonus completed a transaction, or the Arrangement, with OncoGenex Technologies whereby Sonus
acquired all of the outstanding preferred shares, common shares and convertible debentures of OncoGenex Technologies. Sonus then changed its name to OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Prior to the Arrangement, Sonus entered into a non-cancellable lease
arrangement for office space located in Bothell, Washington, the square footage of which exceeds our current requirements. We are currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space. We recorded an
initial restructuring charge of $21 million on August21, 2008 as part of the purchase price allocation. The liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the 
89 Table of Contents
remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with the then effective EITF No95-3, Recognition of
Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination. This represents our best estimate of the liability. Subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion, or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions are recognized as
adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods. In June 2009, we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the excess
lease facility liability. These assumptions were subsequently revised again in December 2009 and September 2010. These changes in estimate resulted in increases in the value of the excess lease liability of $05 million, $35 million, and $40
million in expense recorded in June 2009,December 2009, and September 2010, respectively, to reflect these changes in estimate. In the year ended December31, 2011, with respect to excess facilities, $04 million was amortized into income
as a reduction of research and development expense, resulting in a remaining liability of $70 million at December31, 2011.  September 30 September 30 September 30 September 30 In thousands

Other assets include deposits paid for office space in accordance with the terms of the operating lease agreements. 
9. INCOME TAX 
[a] The reconciliation of income tax attributable to operations computed at the statutory tax rate to income tax expense is as
follows. OncoGenex Technologies, a Canadian corporation, which is subject to combined Canadian federal and provincial statutory tax rates for December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 of 265%, 285%, and 30%, respectively. Following the reverse
takeover by OncoGenex Technologies of Sonus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which subsequently changed its name to OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2008, OncoGenex Technologies became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which is a Delaware
incorporated company subject to US Federal Statutory rates of 34% for all three years presented. For the purposes of estimating the tax rate
in effect at the time that deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to reverse, management uses the furthest out available future tax rate in the applicable jurisdictions. For the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 the future
Canadian enacted rates we used were 25%, 25%, and 25%, respectively, while for the US the future enacted rate we used was 34% for all three periods presented.  September 30 September 30 September 30 In thousands

[b] At December31, 2011, the Company has investment tax credits of $1,317,000 2010$741,000available
to reduce future Canadian income taxes otherwise payable. The Company also has non-capital loss carryforwards of $41,062,000 2010$28,280,000available to offset future taxable income in Canada and federal net operating loss
carryforwards of $133,121,000 2010- $126,911,000 to offset future taxable income in the United States. Under Sections 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and development tax credit carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income. Any such annual
limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits before they expire. We have not completed a Section382 study at this time to determine the impact ownership changes have had on our carryforwards.
In each period since our inception, we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset, as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. As a result, we have not recognized any federal or state income tax benefit in our statement of operations. The initial public offering of common stock by the Company in 1995 caused an ownership change
pursuant to applicable regulations in effect under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Therefore, the Companys use of losses incurred through the date of ownership change will be limited during the carryforward period and may result in the
expiration of net operating loss carryforwards in the United States before utilization. The investment tax credits and non-capital losses and
net operating losses for income tax purposes expire as follows in thousands:  September 30 September 30 September 30 InvestmentTaxCredits NetOperatingLosses Non-capital Losses 2011 47 2012 44 2013 2014 1,707 2015 2016 2017 2018 9 10,795 2019 68 32 2020 72 2,745 2021 129 400 2022 2 11,766 2023 1 10,785 2024 16,814 2025 244 2,062 7,407 2026 71 27,157 4,982 2027 22,225 5,650 2028 28 12,648 2,410 2029 123 4,357 2030 205 5,034 6,124 2031 365 6,210 12,782

In addition, the Company has unclaimed tax deductions of approximately $11,768,000 related to scientific
research and experimental development expenditures available to carry forward indefinitely to reduce Canadian taxable income of future years. The Company also has research and development tax credits of $1,647,000 available to reduce future taxes
payable in the United States. The research and development tax credits expire between 2012 and 2028. [c] Significant components of the
Companys deferred tax assets as of December31 are shown below in thousands:  September 30 September 30 2011 2010 Deferred tax assets Tax basis in excess of book value of assets 1,181 1,187 Non-capital loss carryforwards 55,499 50,220 Research and development deductions and credits 5,672 4,679 Share issue costs 42 83 Stock options 1,632 1,475 Capital loss carryforward 51 51 Restructuring liability 2,611 2,717 Foreign tax credit Other 211 27 
Total deferred tax assets 66,899 60,439 Valuation allowance 66,899 60,439
The potential income tax benefits relating to these deferred tax assets have not been recognized in the accounts as their
realization did not meet the requirements of more likely than not under the liability method of tax allocation. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded and no deferred tax assets have been recognized as at December31,
2011 and 2010. [d] Under ASC 740, the benefit of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the
relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of the benefit of an uncertain tax position may be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being
sustained. A reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits of uncertain tax positions for the year ended December31, 2011 is as
follows:  September 30 in thousands Balance as of December31, 2009 2,009 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 48 Deductions based on tax positions related to the current year 50 
Balance as of December31, 2010 2,007 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 87 Deductions based on tax positions related to the current year 158 
Balance as of December31, 2011 1,936  92 Table of Contents
As of December31, 2011, unrecognized benefits of approximately $1,936,000, if recognized, would affect
the Companys effective tax rate, and would reduce the Companys deferred tax assets. See note 4 for discussion of the Companys assessment of potential withholdings taxes owed to the ITA resulting from the Collaboration Agreement.
The Companys accounting policy is to treat interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income taxes.
As of December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 the Company had no accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes. The
Company is subject to taxes in Canada and the U.S. until the applicable statute of limitations expires. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. September 30 Tax Jurisdiction

July 2009 Financing On
July24, 2009, the Company completed a registered direct offering with certain institutional investors covering the sale of 475,000 shares of common stock at a price of $20 per share under a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 No.
333-160251 that was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on July17, 2009. The transaction provided net proceeds of approximately $93 million after deducting costs associated with the offering. 
2009 Teva Stock Purchase Agreement On
December20, 2009 the Company and Teva also entered into a stock purchase agreement the Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Teva made a $10 million equity investment in the Company
through its purchase of 267,531 shares of the common shares at a price of $3738 per Share, which was a 20% premium to a thirty-day average closing price prior to the announcement. The transaction provided net proceeds of approximately $9,970,000
after deducting costs associated with the offering. The 20% share premium has been allocated to revenue, resulting in a net amount of $7,903,000 included in equity. October 2010 Public Offering On October22, 2010, the Company completed a public
offering of 3,174,602 units, with each unit consisting of one share of the Companys common stock and one-half 1/2of one warrant, at a purchase price of $1575 per unit for an aggregate offering amount of $50 million. 
Each whole warrant is exercisable at any time on or after the date of issuance until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance at an exercise price
of $20, and includes a cashless exercise feature. The Company accounts for warrants issued in October 2010 under the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to, and potentially settled in, a companys
own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws, the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement. The
Company classifies warrants on the accompanying 
93 Table of Contents
consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance. The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to value the warrants.
Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment. On the date of issuance, the Black-Scholes value of the warrant was based on an assumed risk-free rate of 117 volatility of 75% and an expected life of 5 years. A small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation. Changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of
loss as gain loss on warrant. The net proceeds to OncoGenex, after underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses, from
the sale of the units were $467 million, of which $323 million was allocated to common shares and included in Additional paid-in capital, $154 million was allocated to Warrant liability. $1 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and
other offering expenses allocated to the value of Warrants was expensed in warrant issuance expense on our consolidated statement of loss. At
December31, 2011, there were exercisable warrants outstanding to purchase 1,587,301 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $20 per share, expiring in October 2015. No warrants were exercised during the years ended December31,
2010 or December31, 2011. Stock Option Exercises During the year ended December31, 2011, the Company issued 56,228 common shares upon exercise of stock options year ended December31, 2010 194,956, year ended December31, 2009

2010 Performance Incentive Plan At the
2010 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company held on May26, 2011, stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the Companys 2010 Performance Incentive Plan. As a result of this amendment, the 2010 Plan was amended to
provide for an increase in the total shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2010 Plan from 450,000 to 1,050,000. Under the plan, the Company may grant options to purchase common shares or restricted stock units in the Company to
employees, directors, officers and consultants of the Company. The exercise price of the options is determined is determined by the Board but generally will be at least equal to the fair value of the common shares at the grant date. The options vest
in accordance with terms as determined by the Board, typically over three to four years for options issued to employees, and over one to three years for members of the Board of Directors. The expiry date for each option is set by the Board with a
maximum expiry date of ten years from the date of grant. Options remain outstanding under a number of share option plans that had been
approved by shareholders prior to the approval of the 2010 Performance Incentive Plan: athe Incentive Stock Option, Nonqualified Stock Option and Restricted Stock Purchase Plan 1991 1991 Plan, bthe 1999 Nonqualified Stock

ASC 718 Compensation Stock Compensation The Company recognizes expense related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using the provisions of ASC 718. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the most
appropriate fair value method for its awards and recognizes compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the 
94 Table of Contents
requisite service period. In valuing its options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the Company makes assumptions about risk-free interest rates, dividend yields, volatility and
weighted average expected lives, including estimated forfeiture rates of the options. The expected life was calculated based on the
simplified method as permitted by the SECs Staff Accounting Bulletin 110, Share-Based Payment. The Company considers the use of the simplified method appropriate because of the lack of sufficient historical exercise data following the
reverse takeover of Sonus. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization. The risk-free interest rate was
based on a U.S. Treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. In addition to the assumptions above, as required under ASC 718, management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing
compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest. Forfeiture rates are estimated using historical actual forfeiture rate that resulted over the estimated life of the option grant for options granted as of the beginning of the
forfeiture measurement period. These rates are adjusted on a quarterly basis and any change in compensation expense is recognized in the period of the change. The Company has never paid or declared dividends on our common stock and do not expect to
pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The estimated fair value of stock options granted in the respective periods was determined
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions:  September 30 September 30 September 30 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rates 170 273 285 Expected dividend yield 0 0 0 Expected life 59years 68years 61years Expected volatility 76 75 74 The weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December31, 2011 was $1070 per
share December 31, 2010$1108 and December31, 2009$1197. Total stock-based compensation expense included in the
Companys statements of loss for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $1,188,000, $642,000 and $380,000 respectively.

Options vest in accordance with terms as determined by the Board, typically over three or four years for employee grants
and over one or three years for Board of Director option grants. The expiry date for each option is set by the Board with, which is typically seven to ten years. The exercise price of the options is determined by the Board but is at least equal to
the fair value of the share at the grant date.

As at December31, 2011 and December31, 2010 the total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock
options granted is $2,675,100 and $2,962,000 respectively, which is expected to be recognized into expense over a period of approximately 26 years. The estimated grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $1,102,000, $736,000 and $399,000 respectively. 
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of
the underlying common stock as of the date of exercise. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $592,000, $2,355,000, and $697,000, respectively. At December31, 2011,
the aggregate intrinsic value of the outstanding options was $3,444,000 and the aggregate intrinsic value of the exercisable options was $2,868,00. [d] Stock Warrants At December31, 2011, there were exercisable warrants outstanding to
purchase 1,587,301 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $20 per share, expiring in October 2015. No warrants were exercised during the years ended December31, 2009 or December31, 2010. 
The estimated fair value of warrants issued is reassessed at each balance sheet date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following
assumptions were used to value the warrants on the following year end balance sheet dates:  September 30 September 30 September 30 Years ended December31 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rates 055 201 Expected dividend yield 0 0 Expected life 38years 48years Expected volatility 76 75  97 Table of Contents
[e] Shareholder Rights Plan The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan which was adopted in July 1996 and subsequently amended in July 2002,October 2005,August 2006, and May 2008 the Rights Plan. Under the
Plan the Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Preferred Stock Purchase Right Right for each outstanding common share of the Company. Subject to the Rights Plan, each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $140, subject to adjustment. These Rights provide the holders with the right to purchase, in the event a person or group acquires 15% or
more of the Companys common stock, additional shares of the Companys common stock having a market value equal to two times the exercise price of the Right. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the one-for-eighteen reverse stock split caused a
proportionate adjustment of the number of Rights associated with each share of common stock. Currently, eighteen 18Rights are associated with each share of common stock. [f] 401k Plan The Company maintains a 401k plan in which it provided a specified percentage
match on employee contributions. Following the Arrangement, the Board of Directors of OncoGenex amended and restated the 401k plan whereas securities of the Company are no longer offered as an investment option. This amendment prohibits the
inclusion of OncoGenex shares in the 401k plan, as well as any match of Company shares to employee contributions. No shares of the Company were issued subsequent to the Arrangement, and as such no related expense was incurred.

11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
There were no related party transactions during the periods ended December31, 2011, 2010 or 2009, and no amounts were included

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. In December 2009, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, OncoGenex Technologies, entered into a Collaboration Agreement with Teva for the development and global
commercialization of custirsen and related compounds. Under the Collaboration Agreement, Teva made upfront payments in the aggregate amount of $50 million, and may make additional payments up to $370 million upon the achievement of developmental
and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid-teens to mid-
98 Table of Contents
twenties on net sales. Teva also acquired $10 million of our common stock at a premium under a separate Stock Purchase Agreement. We are required to contribute $30 million in direct and indirect
costs towards the Clinical Development Plan. As of December31, 2011, $117 million of these costs have been incurred by OncoGenex, resulting in a remaining funding responsibility of $183 million which has been recorded under Current Deferred
Collaboration Revenue. Teva will fund all other expenses under the Clinical Development Plan. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we
agreed to collaborate with Teva in the development and global commercialization of custirsen. Teva received the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds the
Licensed Products. We have an option to co-promote custirsen in the United States and Canada. In addition to the development
costs noted above, Teva is also responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to our co-promotion option, except for start-up costs in advance of commercialization. 
Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. and University of British Columbia Pursuant to license agreements we have with the UBC and Isis, we are obligated to pay milestone payments of up to CAD $16 million and $775 million, respectively, upon the achievement of specified
product development milestones related to OGX-427 and OGX-225 and low to mid single digit royalties on future product sales. In addition, we
are required to pay to Isis 30% of all Non-Royalty Revenue defined to mean revenue not based on net sales of products we receive. Isis has disclosed in its SEC filings that it is entitled to receive 30% of the up to $370 million in milestone
payments we may receive from Teva as part of the Collaboration Agreement; however, we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as Royalty Revenue defined to mean revenue based on net sales of products,
and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations. No assurance can be provided that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or, if we are, that the applicable amount payable to Isis will be less than 30%. We are also
obligated to pay to UBC certain patent costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of CAD $8,000 per year. We paid Isis and UBC USD $750,000 and CAD $100,000, respectively, in 2010 upon the initiation of a phase 2
clinical trial of OGX-427 in patients with CRPC. We do not anticipate making any royalty payments to Isis in 2012. The UBC agreements have
effective dates ranging from November1, 2001 to April5, 2005 and each agreement expires upon the later of 20 years from its effective date or the expiry of the last patent licensed thereunder, unless otherwise terminated. 
Unless otherwise terminated, the Isis agreements for custirsen and OGX-427 will continue for each product until the later of 10 years after the date of
the first commercial product sale, or the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the product, unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons either custirsen or OGX-427 and Isis does not elect to
unilaterally continue development. The Isis agreement for OGX-225 will continue into perpetuity unless OncoGenex Technologies abandons the product and Isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development. 
To facilitate the execution and performance of the Collaboration Agreement with Teva, OncoGenex and Isis agreed to amend the Isis License Agreement and
OncoGenex and UBC agreed to make a corresponding amendment to the UBC License Agreement, in each case, effective December19 and December20, 2009, respectively. The amendment to the Isis License Agreement provides, among other things, that if we are subject to change of control with a third party, where the surviving company immediately following such change of
control has the right to develop and sell the product, then ia milestone payment of $20 million will be due and payable to Isis 21 days following the first commercial sale of the product in the United States; and iiunless such
surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to Isis by the Company has been established, the applicable royalty rate payable to Isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the Isis License
Agreement. Any non-royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the $20 million milestone if not already paid. As a result of the $10 million milestone payment payable to Isis in relation to the Collaboration
99 Table of Contents
Agreement, the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of $10 million. Because we have now licensed the product to Teva and established a royalty
rate payable to Isis, no royalty rate adjustments would apply if Teva were to acquire us and becomes the surviving company. If the $30 million in advanced reimbursement of development activities has not been spent by OncoGenex prior to the third
anniversary of the Collaboration Agreement between OncoGenex and Teva, OncoGenex will pay Isis an amount equal to 30% of any un-spent portion less $35 million. Bayer HealthCare LLC On June27, 2008, Sonus completed an exclusive in-licensing
agreement with Bayer HealthCare LLC for the right to develop, commercialize or sublicense a family of compounds known as caspase activators presently in pre-clinical research. Under terms of the agreement, Sonus was granted exclusive rights to
develop two core compounds for all prophylactic and therapeutic uses in humans. Additionally, Sonus was granted rights to all other non-core compounds covered under the patents for use in oncology. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Bayer received an upfront license fee of $05 million. OncoGenex will make annual payments to Bayer on the anniversary
date, or the Anniversary Payments, with an initial payment of $100,000 paid in 2008. The payments increase by $25,000 each year until the initiation of the first phase 3 clinical trial, at which point the Anniversary Payments reset to $100,000 each
year and increase by $25,000 until we achieve either the first New Drug Application filing in the United States or the European Union. OncoGenex is obligated to pay royalties on net future product sales in addition to aggregate milestone payments of
up to $14 million for clinical development and regulatory milestones. No milestone payments are triggered prior to the initiation of a phase 3 clinical trial. We have the option to terminate this contract upon 60 days written notice to Bayer.
Lease Arrangements We have
an operating lease agreement for office space being used in Vancouver, Canada, which expires in September 2014. Future minimum annual lease

In November 2006, prior to the Arrangement , Sonus entered into a non-cancellable operating lease agreement for office
space in Bothell, Washington, expiring in 2017 please see Note 7 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with the lease, Sonus was required to provide a cash security
deposit of approximately $05 million, which is included in Other Long Term Assets. In addition, a standby letter of credit was issued by us in 2010, and $04 million remains in a restricted money market account as collateral. We continue to
evaluate opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space and has recorded a liability in the excess facilities lease charge of $70 million as at December31, 2011 please see Note 7. 
If we are unable to exit or sublet portions of this leased space, the future minimum annual lease payments are as follows in thousands: September 30 2012 2,117 2013 2,180 2014 2,246 2015 2,313 2016 2,382 Remainder 2,455

Consolidated rent expense relating to both the Vancouver, Canada and Bothell, Washington offices for years
ended December31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $26 million, $23 million, and $24 million respectively. Clinical Research
Organizations Our clinical research organization, or CRO, contracts typically call for specified prepaid amounts to be maintained and
held in escrow for future services to be rendered by the CRO. An amount of $750,000 was paid in January 2012 for future services to be performed for the phase 2 trial of OGX-427 in patients with metastatic bladder cancer. 
Guarantees and Indemnifications We
indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The term of the indemnification period is equal to the officers
or directors lifetime. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, we have obtained director and
officer insurance that limits our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. We believe that the fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. Accordingly, we have not recognized any liabilities
relating to these obligations as of December31, 2011. We have certain agreements with certain organizations with which we do business
that contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we typically agree to indemnify the party against certain types of third-party claims. We accrue for known indemnification issues when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
There were no accruals for or expenses related to indemnification issues for any period presented.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material
information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules
13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have not made any changes to our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act during
the quarter ended December31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of
our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. As of December31, 2011, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on this evaluation, management has
determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2011. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included above.
