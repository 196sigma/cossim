Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
Managements
report on our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act is included in our 2009
Annual Report to Shareholders under the caption Managements Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting and is incorporated by reference.
Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During
fiscal year 2009, we began designing and implementing a new enterprise resource
planning ERPsystem and certain supply chain modules to integrate and
improve the financial and operational aspects of our business. On November 11,
2008, we transitioned our financial accounting and reporting processes to the
new ERP system as part of a phased implementation plan. The implementation of
this new ERP system involved changes to our procedures for internal control over
financial reporting. We followed a detailed implementation plan that required
significant pre-implementation planning, design and testing. We also conducted
an extensive post-implementation review to ensure that the internal controls
over financial reporting were properly designed.
We
remediated the material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting identified as of January 4, 2009 related to the application of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS 142, by enhancing our controls over the preparation
and the review of the goodwill impairment tests required by SFAS 142,
specifically by adding the assistance of a third-party valuation firm in the
review of the impairment tests.
With the
exception of the changes discussed above, there have been no changes to our
internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph d of Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act during the most
recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
