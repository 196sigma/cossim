The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Semitool and its wholly-owned subsidiaries: Semitool Europe

Semitool FSC, Inc.; and Rhetech, Inc. Rhetech.
All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in

Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting periods. Actual results inevitably will differ from those
estimates, and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial
statements.
Cash Equivalents
The
Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of ninety
days or less to be cash equivalents. 
Marketable Securities
The Company classifies its marketable securities as available-for-sale in accordance
with the provision of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities. Securities classified as available-for-sale are
reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses
included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
OCI. Realized gains and losses and declines in value of securities
judged to be other than temporary are included in net income.
Derivatives
Effective October 1, 2000,
the Company adopted SFAS 133, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts for hedging activities. All derivatives, whether
designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is designated as a fair value
hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item
attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is
designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and are recognized in the
statement of income when the hedged item affects earnings. Ineffective portions
of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings. 
The Company uses derivative
instruments to manage some of its exposures to foreign currency risks. The
objective for holding derivatives is to minimize the risks using the most
effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures. The Company uses
cash flow hedge accounting per SFAS 133 to account for its hedges. At the
inception of the hedge, the Company documents the hedging relationship to a forecasted
transaction, risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the
hedge. Quarterly, the Company uses forward rates to evaluate its hedging effectiveness. If
the derivative no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, or the terms of the
hedged item change so the derivative no longer qualifies for hedge accounting,
the Company marks the derivative to market. Any amounts in OCI on a derivative that no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting are transferred to the statement of
operations. At maturity or termination the gain or loss on the derivative is
calculated and reported in net income. 
The Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts, which typically mature within
one year, as part of an overall risk-management strategy. These instruments are
used as an economic hedge of receivables denominated in Yen. Transaction gains
and losses on these contracts and the related receivables are recognized in the
consolidated statements of operations. The impact of movements in currency
exchange rates on forward foreign exchange contracts generally offsets the
related impact on the underlying items being hedged, and therefore net foreign
currency gains and losses on these transactions historically have not been
material. However, during fiscal 1999, significant receivables were not hedged
which resulted in net foreign currency gains of $12 million. In entering into
these forward contracts, the Company has assumed the risk that might arise from
the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.
The Company does not expect any losses as a result of counterparty defaults. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.
As of September 30, 2001 and 2000, the Company had foreign currency exchange contracts to sell 665 million Yen US $57
million and 17 billion Yen US $163 million, respectively, at contracted forward rates maturing at various dates in
fiscal year 2002.
Certain forecasted
transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk. The Company monitors its foreign
currency exposures regularly to maximize the overall effectiveness of the
foreign currency hedge positions. The only currency hedged is the Japanese Yen.
Forward contracts used to hedge forecasted international sales on credit for up
to eighteen months in the future are designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. 
Hedge ineffectiveness,
determined in accordance with SFAS 133, had no impact on earnings for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2001. No fair value hedges or cash flow hedges
were derecognized or discontinued for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. 
Derivative gains and losses
included in OCI are reclassified into earnings each period during the duration
of the related recognized foreign-currency denominated receivable. During the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, the amount transferred from OCI to
Other income expense, net, was not material. We estimate that $47,000 of net
derivative losses included in OCI will be reclassified into earnings within the
next twelve months. 
Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of first-in, first-out FIFO cost or market. The
Company periodically reviews its inventories to identify slow moving and
obsolete inventories to record such inventories at net realizable values. It is
reasonably possible that the Companys estimates of net realizable values
could change in the near term due to technological and other changes.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight-line method
with estimated useful lives as follows   Buildings and improvements             10-40 years
Machinery and equipment               2-5 years
Furniture, fixtures and leasehold improvements    3-7 years
Vehicles and aircraft                5-10 years Major additions and betterments are capitalized. Costs of maintenance and repairs
which do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed
when incurred. When items are disposed of, the related costs and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized.
Intangible Assets
Intangible
assets include the cost of internally developed software and legal costs
associated with obtaining patents. 
Costs incurred for internally developed software products and enhancements after
technological feasibility and marketability have been established for the
related product are capitalized and are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. Amortization is provided based on the greater of the amount
computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bears to
the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product, or
b the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the product,
estimated at three years. No software costs were capitalized in fiscal 2001,
2000 and 1999. Amortization of such costs in fiscals 2001, 2000 and 1999 were
$255,000, $927,000 and $1,105,000. No capitalized software remained on the
balance sheet as of September 30, 2001.
The
cost of patents is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of 17
years or the estimated product life. 
Revenue Recognition
In December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
staff accounting bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company adopted SAB 101 retroactive to October 1, 2000. Under this method,
revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price is
fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales of new
products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer
acceptance. Likewise, sale of existing products to new customer environments are
not recognized until acceptance. Whereas, sales of existing products into
existing customer environments are treated as multiple element arrangements if
multiple elements exist. The amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements
is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount
that was due upon title transfer. The revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in
deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and/or services are
delivered or performed.
Revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or
ratably over the life of the related service contract. Spare parts sales are
recognized upon shipment.
As a result of implementing SAB 101, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition. This change resulted
in a cumulative deferred revenue of $578 million as of October 1, 2000, which was recorded as a non-cash charge of $176 million
after reduction for income taxes of $87 million, or a charge of $061 per share, to reflect the cumulative effect of the
accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2001. The deferred profit balance as of October 1, 2000 was $263 million.
Deferred profit equals the amount of system revenue that was shipped, but deferred under SAB 101 less all applicable product,
warranty and commission costs. Of the $263 million in deferred profit, the full amount was recognized in fiscal
2001. The results for the first three quarters of fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 have been restated in accordance with SAB
101 as shown in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with SAB 101 are not available to restate financial information
for the periods before October 1, 2000. The change in revenue recognition does not affect the Company cash flow.
Prior to June 30, 2001, the Companys revenue recognition policy was to recognize
revenue at the time of shipment to the customer. Customer service contract revenue was recognized ratably over the life
of the contract.
Prior to the sale of the Company wholly-owned
subsidiary, Semy Engineering, Inc., software revenue was recognized when there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the software
had been delivered, the price was fixed and determinable, and collectibility was probable in accordance with the AICPA Statement
of Position 97-2 Software Revenue Recognition.
Accrued Warranty
The Companys obligations for warranty are accrued concurrently
with the revenue recognized. The Company has made a provision for its warranty
obligations based upon historical costs incurred for such obligations adjusted,
as necessary, for current conditions and factors. Due to the significant
uncertainties and judgments involved in estimating the Companys warranty
and installation obligations, including changing product designs and
specifications, the ultimate amount incurred for warranty and installation costs
could change in the near term from the Companys current estimate.
Foreign Currency
Except for Semitool Japan KK, where the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, the
functional currency for the Companys foreign operations is the U.S.
Dollar, in which most of our sales and purchases are denominated. For these
foreign operations, realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions
and unrealized gains and losses from re-measurement of the financial statements
of the foreign operations into the functional currency are included in the
consolidated statements of operations.
Semitool Japan KK, invoices its customers in Yen. Gains of $203,000, $673,000 and $12
million in 2001, 2000 and 1999 are included in Other Income Expense in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses from
remeasurement of the financial statements are reflected as a component of Other
Comprehensive Income Loss.
Research and Development Costs
Costs of research and development are expensed as incurred.
Earnings Loss Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and potential common shares, except
when they are antidilutive. Potential shares result from the assumed exercise of
outstanding stock options. Diluted earnings per share excludes the effects of
antidilutive stock options of 119,700, 35,000 and 1,778,900 in fiscal 2001, 2000
and 1999, respectively.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings loss per common share for the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999 in thousands                                2001    2000    1999

New Accounting Pronouncements
In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement Nos.
141 and 142 SFAS 141 and SFAS 142, Business Combinations and
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, respectively. SFAS 141
replaces APB 16 and eliminates pooling-of-interests accounting prospectively. It
also provides guidance on purchase accounting related to the recognition of
intangible assets and accounting for negative goodwill. SFAS 142 changes the
accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment-only
approach. Under SFAS 142, goodwill will be tested annually and whenever events
or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. SFAS 141 and
SFAS 142 are effective for all business combinations completed after June 30,
2001. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, amortization of goodwill recorded for business
combinations consummated prior to July 1, 2001 will cease, and intangible assets
acquired prior to July 1, 2001 that do not meet the criteria for recognition
under SFAS 141 will be reclassified to goodwill. Companies are required to adopt
SFAS 142 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, but early adoption
is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141 and 142 to
have a significant impact on its financial position, results of operations and
cash flows.
In June of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations. The statement provides accounting and reporting
standards for recognizing obligations related to asset retirement costs
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. Under this
statement, obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets are
to be recognized at their fair value in the period in which they are incurred if
a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the asset
retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational
method over the assets useful life. Any subsequent changes to the fair
value of the liability due to passage of time or changes in the amount or timing
of estimated cash flows is recognized as an accretion expense. The Company will
be required to adopt this statement no later than October 1, 2003. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on
its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
In October of 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, which is effective for fiscal
years beginning after Dec 15, 2001. This statement supercedes FASB Statement No.
121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of. However, it retains the fundamental provisions
of SFAS No. 121 for the recognition and measurement of the impairment of
long-lived assets to be held and used and the measurement of long-lived assets
to be disposed of by sale. Impairment of Goodwill is not included in the scope
of SFAS No. 144 and will be treated in accordance with the accounting standards
established in SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
According to SFAS No. 144, long-lived assets are to be measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, whether reported in continuing
or discontinued operations. The statement applies to all long-lived assets,
including discontinued operations, and replaces the provisions of APB Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations -- Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring Events and Transactions, for the disposal of segments of a
business. The Company will be required to adopt this statement no later than
October 1, 2002. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this statement
on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Reclassifications
Certain 2000 and 1999 financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to
2001 presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on net income loss or
retained earnings as previously reported.

4.Quarterly Financial Data Unaudited In December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC issued
staff accounting bulletin SAB No. 101, Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the
Company adopted SAB 101 retroactive to October 1, 2000. Under this method,
revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the sellers price is
fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Sales of new
products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer
acceptance. Likewise, sale of existing products to new customer environments are
not recognized until acceptance. Whereas, sales of existing products into
existing customer environments are treated as multiple element arrangements if
multiple elements exist. The amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements
is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount
that was due upon title transfer. The revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in
deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and/or services are
delivered or performed.
Revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or
ratably over the life of the related service contract. Spare parts sales are
recognized upon shipment.
As a result of implementing SAB 101, the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition. This change resulted
in a cumulative deferred revenue of $578 million as of October 1, 2000, which was recorded as a non-cash charge of $176 million
after reduction for income taxes of $87 million, or a charge of $061 per share, to reflect the cumulative effect of the
accounting change as of the beginning of fiscal 2001. The deferred profit balance as of October 1, 2000 was $263 million.
Deferred profit equals the amount of system revenue that was shipped, but deferred under SAB 101 less all applicable product,
warranty and commission costs. Of the $263 million in deferred profit, the full amount was recognized in fiscal
2001. The results for the first three quarters of fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 have been restated in accordance with SAB
101. Data to reflect the change in accounting principle in accordance with SAB 101 are not available to restate financial information
for the periods before October 1, 2000. The change in revenue recognition does not affect the Company cash flow.                                     Year Ended September 30, 2001

providing the remaining 20%. The notes are personally guaranteed by Raymon F.
Thompson, the Companys chairman.

The mortgage term note payable to First Union National Bank is collateralized by
a first lien deed of trust on the Coopersburg, Pennsylvania office and
manufacturing facility and by all fixtures and personal property of Rhetech,
Inc. necessary for the operation of the facility. The mortgage term note payable
to PIDA is collateralized by a second lien upon the premises in Coopersburg,
Pennsylvania upon which the Rhetech, Inc. office and manufacturing facility
resides, and is subordinate only to the $540,000 mortgage, dated March 26, 1998,
between Rhetech, Inc. and First Union National Bank. The net book value of
assets pledged under the agreements was $21 million at September 30, 2001.

6.Employee Benefit and Stock Option Plans Semitool maintains a
profit-sharing plan and trust under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the terms of the plan, U.S. employees may make voluntary contributions to
the plan. Semitool contributes a matching amount equal to 50% of the
employees voluntary contribution up to 5% of the employees
compensation. Semitool may also make non-matching contributions to the plan,
which are determined annually by the Board of Directors. Total profit sharing
contribution cost for this plan was approximately $12 million, $11 million and
$12 million for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. 
Semitool Europe Ltd.
maintains a defined contribution pension agreement. This pension agreement is
open to all employees with more than three months of service. The employer and
employee contributions are invested in each individual members personal
pension plan with a United Kingdom insurance company. The employer has an
obligation to make contributions at one-half of the contribution rate paid by
the employee, subject to a rate between 25% and 50% of the employees
salary. The total pension cost for this plan for the years ended September 30,
2001, 2000 and 1999 approximated $39,000, $48,000 and $36,000, respectively. 
The Companys other
foreign subsidiaries do not operate their own pension plans, but retirement
benefits are generally provided to employees through government plans operated
in their respective countries. 
In December 1994, the Board
of Directors adopted and the shareholders approved the Semitool, Inc. 1994 Stock
Option Plan the Option Plan. A total of 1,800,000 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance under the Option Plan. In 1997, 1998 and 1999, the Option
Plan was amended to increase the number of shares of common stock available for
issuance thereunder by 400,000 shares per amendment for a total increase of
1,200,000. In 2000, the Option Plan was again amended for an additional 300,000
shares. The total shares reserved for the Option Plan is 3,300,000 at September
30, 2001. Options granted under the Option Plan generally become exercisable at
a rate of 5% per quarter commencing three months after the grant date. Semitool
may grant options that qualify as incentive stock options to employees and
nonqualified stock options to employees, officers and directors, independent
contractors and consultants. The Option Plan also provides for automatic grants
of nonqualified stock options to independent directors. The Option Plan will
terminate in December 2004 unless terminated earlier at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. At September 30, 2001, 886,012 shares were available for
future issuance under the Option Plan. Options are granted at an exercise price
equal to the market price of the common stock and no compensation expense has
been recognized in 2001, 2000 or 1999 under the Option Plan.

Weighted-average exercise price per share      $652    $583    $500 The exercise and sale of
certain qualified options resulted in the treatment of those options as
nonqualified options for tax purposes. As a result, the Company received tax
benefits associated with those options of $19,000 in 2000, which has been
recorded as additional capital. 
The Company has adopted the
disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 SFAS No. 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Had
compensation cost for the Option Plan been determined based on the fair value
consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Companys net income
loss and earnings loss per share would have been changed to the pro forma
amounts shown below in thousands, except for per share amounts:                             2001     2000     1999

option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for
grants in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: dividend yield of 0% for all years;
expected volatility of 800%, 760% and 700%; risk-free interest rates of 51 64% and 544%; and expected lives of 48, 46 and 46 years. The
weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended
September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, was $608, $569 and $277, respectively.

The Company has established
a valuation allowance of $528,000 at September 30, 2001 and $617,000 at
September 30, 2000 to reduce the deferred tax asset related to the net operating
loss carryforwards in its Japanese and Asian subsidiaries. 
The Company has net
operating loss carryforwards of $1,500,000 in Singapore that have no expiration. 
Cumulative undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, for which no U.S. income or foreign
withholding taxes have been recorded, was approximately $75 million at
September 30, 2001. Such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability with respect
to such earnings is not practicable. The additional taxes payable on the
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, if remitted, would be substantially offset by
U.S. tax credits for foreign taxes already paid.

8.Related Party Transactions Semitool has agreements
with Mr. Raymon F. Thompson, the Companys chairman, to lease aircraft.
Under these agreements, rent expense was approximately $2,127,000, $684,000 and
$474,000 for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
The rental rate for fiscal 2002 will be approximately $224,000 per month for
both the aircraft and the hangar; the lease terms are month-to-month. 
Periodically, Semitool
advances funds to Mr. Thompson and pays certain expenses for the benefit of
Mr.Thompson. These advances are offset by amounts payable to Mr. Thompson
under the agreements described in the preceding paragraph. Net advances to
from Mr. Thompson are charged interest at the Companys borrowing rate
for short-term funds. 
9.Commitments and Contingencies The Company has various
operating lease agreements for equipment and office space that expire through
the year 2006. Total rent expense for the years ended September 30, 2001, 2000
and 1999, exclusive of amounts paid to a related party as described in Note 8,
was approximately $18 million, $16 million, and $16 million, respectively. At
September 30, 2001, future rental payments under these agreements are as follows

In response to the
Companys patent infringement lawsuit against Novellus Systems, Inc. Case
No. CV-01-874-KI, Novellus, by a motion dated October 18, 2001, amended its
counterclaim seeking a declaration of the invalidity of our U.S. Patent 6,197,181
with separate allegations of our infringement of four of their patents: viz.,
U.S. Patent 6,179,983 Method and Apparatus for Treating Surface Including
Virtual Anode; U.S. Patent 6,074,544 Method of Electroplating
Semiconductor Wafer Using Variable Currents and Mass Transfer to Obtain Uniform
Plated Layer; U.S. Patent 6,110,346 Method of Electroplating
Semiconductor Wafer Using Variable Currents and Mass Transfer to Obtain Uniform
Plated Layer; and U.S. Patent 6,162,344 Method of Electroplating
Semiconductor Wafer Using Variable Currents and Mass Transfer to Obtain Uniform
Plated Layer. The counterclaims seek injunctive relief, damages for past
infringement, increased damages for willful infringement and attorneys
fees. We believe that the counterclaims are without merit and are contesting the
action vigorously. However, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there
can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome with be in our favor. If Novellus
were to prevail in its counterclaims, it could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Further, regardless of the ultimate outcome, there can be no assurance that the
diversion of managements attention, and any costs associated with any of
the lawsuits, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
The Company is subject to
other legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of
business and have not been finally adjudicated. Although there can be no
assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters, it is the opinion of
management, based upon the information available at this time, that the
currently expected outcome of these matters, individually or in the aggregate,
will not have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial
condition or cash flows. 
10.Shareholders' Equity The Board of Directors has
the authority to issue preferred stock of Semitool in one or more series and to
fix the rights, privileges, preferences and restrictions granted to or imposed
upon any unissued shares of preferred stock, without further vote or action by
the common shareholders. 
The Company filed a
registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on June 16, 2000, which was subsequently amended on September 1, 2000 in order
to convert it to a shelf registration of the securities of the
Company with an aggregate public offering price of $75 million. All costs
related to the registration were expensed in fiscal 2000. 
11.Financial Instruments and Certain Concentrations The Company has estimated
the fair value of its financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents,
payable to shareholder, note payable to bank and long-term debt. The fair value
estimates are made at a discrete point in time based on relevant market
information and information about the financial instruments. Fair value
estimates are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. Accordingly,
the estimates are not necessarily indicative of what the Company could realize
in a current market exchange. 
The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments at September 30, 2001 and 2000 for which it is practicable to
estimate that value: 
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the nature of the
cash investments.
Marketable
Securities Marketable securities are marked-to-market at September 30,
2001 to approximate fair value. 
Payable to Shareholder - The carrying value of the shareholder payable approximates fair value due to the fact that the note
carries a variable interest rate.
Note Payable to Bank and Other Short-term Debt - The
carrying value of the note payable to bank and other short-term debt approximates fair value due to the fact that the instruments
bear a negotiated variable interest rate.
Long-Term Debt - The fair value of notes payable is based on the discounted value of
contractual cash flows using an estimated discount rate of 60% and 950% at
September 30, 2001 and 2000, respectively, which the Company could currently
obtain for debt with similar remaining maturities.
The estimated fair value of
financial instruments at September 30, 2001 and 2000, consisted of the following
in thousands:                                2001            2000

Marketable securities                6,947    6,947       --        Payable to shareholder                 2      2       61     61
Note payable to bank and other short-term debt    839     839     21,383   21,383
Long-term debt                   3,321    3,249     3,550    2,902 At September30, 2001
and 2000, trade receivables of the Company were primarily from companies in the
semiconductor industry, and included approximately $349 million and $496
million, respectively, of foreign receivables. Accordingly, the Company is
exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company routinely assesses the
financial strength of its customers. 
At September 30, 2001, the Company held marketable equity securities with a cost basis
of $69 million which had an associated unrealized loss of approximately $10 million.
12.Segments, Geographic Location and Major Customers The Company currently
operates in one segment whose primary products perform cleaning and
electroplating processes. The Companys Software Control Systems segment
was sold in February of 2001. The Companys current product offerings
qualify for aggregation under SFAS 131, Disclosure About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information as its products are manufactured and
distributed in the same manner, have similar economic characteristics and are
sold to the same customer base. 
Prior to the sale of the Company Software Control
Systems segment, the Company reportable segments had been determined
based on the nature of its operations, products offered to customers and information used by the chief
operating decision maker as defined by SFAS 131. The Company two reportable segments were Semiconductor
Equipment and Software Control Systems.
The Semiconductor Equipment segment primary
products perform cleaning and electroplating processes. The Software Control Systems segment primary
products were designed to provide advance process control and operational data reporting for most
of the front-end process equipment in a fab. The Semiconductor Equipment product offerings
qualified for aggregation under SFAS 131 as the products were manufactured and distributed in the
same manner, had similar economic characteristics and were sold to the same customer base.
The accounting policies of the segments were the same
as those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note. Segment operating
results were measured based on income loss from operations. Internal sales were based on internal transfer prices.
Internal sales reflected sales of products from the Software Control Systems segment to the Semiconductor
Equipment segment. Segment assets consisted of assets that are identified to reportable segments.
Consolidated sales to one
major customer represented 104% of total consolidated net sales for the year
ended September 30, 2000. No other customer represented more than 10% of total
consolidated net sales for any period presented. 
Financial information by
operating segment for 2000 and 1999 is summarized as follows amounts in
