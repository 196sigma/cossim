These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006.

/S/ KPMG LLP 38 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Board of Directors and ShareholdersSonoSite, Inc.: 
We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting Item 9Ab, that SonoSite, Inc. the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, because of the effect of the material weakness in the controls over income tax reporting, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in managements assessment: 
As of December 31, 2006, the Company did not have the appropriate level of expertise to properlyprepare and review its accounting for income taxes. As a result of this deficiency in the Companys internal control over financial reporting,management didnot detect errors in the measurement of income tax amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.In addition, this deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of income taxes in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
We have also audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders equity and comprehensive incomefor each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2006 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 15, 2007, which expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
In our opinion, managements assessment thatthe Companydid not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.

43 SONOSITE, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Business Overview
SonoSite develops, manufactures, and distributes hand-carried ultrasound systems for use across medical specialties and in a range of treatment settings. 
We commenced operations as a division of ATL Ultrasound, Inc. ATL. On April 6, 1998, we became an independent, publicly owned company through a distribution of one new share of our stock for every three shares of ATL stock held as of that date. ATL retained no ownership in SonoSite following the spin-off. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of presentation and use of estimates
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SonoSite, Inc., and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In preparing the financial statements, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassification of prior period balances
Certain amounts reported in previous periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts with major U.S. banks and highly liquid debt instruments with maturities at purchase of three months or less. 
Investment securities 
Investment securities consist of high-grade U.S. government or corporate debt and high-grade asset-backed securities. We have the ability to hold our securities until maturity, however, we classify all securities as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss until realized. Realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis. 
A decline in market value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is determined to be other than temporary results in a revaluation of its carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Interest income is recognized when earned. We may incur unrealized losses due to changes in market value attributable to changes in interest rates. We have the ability and intent to hold our investments until a recovery of cost, which may be maturity. Accordingly, we view any unrealized losses as temporary at December 31, 2006.
Accounts receivable 
In the ordinary course of business, we grant credit to a broad customer base. Of the accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2006, 56% and 44% were receivable from international and domestic customers, prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts. The same percentages as of December 31, 2005 were 49% and 51% prior to any allowance for doubtful accounts.
44 SONOSITE, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
We maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. When we determine that amounts owed from customers are uncollectible, such amounts are charged off against the allowances for doubtful accounts. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The carrying value of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and certain long-term other assets, approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. Other long-term assets approximate fair value as interest rates on these items approximate market. Our investment securities, which consist of high-grade debt securities, are carried at fair value. 
We utilize foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies. We recognize all derivative financial instruments foreign currency forward contracts in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded in earnings unless hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings. For derivative instruments designed as cash flow and net investment hedges, the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other
comprehensive income. The ineffective portions are recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2006, we had $75 million and $249 million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts that expire on January 29, 2007 and March 31, 2007, respectively. These contracts did not qualify ashedges under SFAS No133 and therefore are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded in income from continuing operations. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out method. Included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department. Adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material, shrinkage, earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product. If market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products, we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories. 
Property and equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, and additions and improvements to property and equipment are capitalized. 
Depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows: Asset 
Estimated Useful Lives 
Equipment and computers 
35 years 
Software 
3-5 years 
Furniture and fixtures 
5 years 
Leasehold improvements 
Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term 45 SONOSITE, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Direct internal and external costs for computer software developed for internal use are capitalized in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use. Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives beginning when each module is complete and ready for use. Such costs totaled $02 million in 2006, $01 million in 2005 and $09 million in 2004.
The carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that may indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For depreciable property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets, we evaluate the carrying value of the asset group by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition with the asset group net book value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from an asset group are less than the net book value of the asset group, we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair market value of the asset group.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, we perform goodwill impairment tests annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate reporting unit carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values. Intangibles subject to amortization, which consist mainly of acquired software technology and non-compete agreements, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Investment in and receivable from affiliates 
When we have investments in companies where we have the ability to exercise influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies, these investments are accounted for under the equity method. Accordingly, our share in the net income or loss in these investees is included in other income or loss. We did not hold any such investments as of December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.
In 2003 and 2004, we invested a total of $02 million into SonoSite China Medical Limited SonoSite China Medical for a 30% ownership interest. In April 2005, we acquired the remaining 70% of SonoSite China Medical for $04 million. The results of SonoSite China Medical operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date.
Concentration of credit and supply risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, investment securities and accounts receivable. 
We depend on some single-source suppliers to provide highly specialized parts and other components, and may experience an interruption of supply if a supplier is unable or unwilling to meet our time, quantity and quality requirements. There are relatively few alternative sources of supply for some of these items. A change in demand for some parts by other companies in our industry could also interrupt our supply of components. 
Our circuit boards are produced by one of the worlds largest electronic manufacturing services suppliers who produces the boards in their Thailand manufacturing facility. If we experience delays in the receipt or a deterioration in product yields of these components, we may experience delays in manufacturing or an increase in costs resulting in lost sales or a deterioration in gross margin. 
Revenue recognition 
We recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer, risk of loss and title have passed to the customer and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. In cases of nonstandard delivery and acceptance criteria, we will not recognize revenue at shipment, but rather when the delivery and acceptance criteria have been satisfied. Revenue is recorded net of estimated returns. Sales discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue.For service contracts, revenue is recognized as services are performed or over the term of the contract. Deferred revenue primarily represents unearned revenue from service contracts made under agreements with customers.
46 SONOSITE, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements. We recognize revenue when risk of loss and title have transferred to the distributor and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Our only significant post-shipment obligation to distributors is our product warranty covering materials and workmanship. The distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error, generally within 30 days of receipt, and in such cases, replacement products would be sent. Since the distributors remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit, we do not deferrevenue associated with these sales. Costs associated with the repair of returned, defective products are captured in our warranty accrual. Our standard arrangements with distributors do not have any other return provisions.
Our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements, which include hardware and software products. Revenue from the sale of software, software-related elements, and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole, is recognized in accordance with SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. We have vendor specific objective evidence VSOE of fair value for our products. Accordingly, for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have VSOE of the elements, revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer. 
Warranty expense 
We accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties. This provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs using managements judgment. Our typical warranty period is one year except for the MicroMaxx system, which has, with certain exceptions, a five-year warranty period. The warranty is included with the original purchase. In addition to our standard warranty, we offer extended warranty and service agreements for coverage beyond the standard warranty period or coverage above what is covered by the standard warranty. 
Research and development 
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of equipment acquired for research and development activities that has alternative future uses. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software-related products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all software-related research and development costs when incurred.
Advertising costs 
We expense costs for advertising and promotional activities as incurred. Advertising and promotional expenses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $117 million, $112 million, and $59 million. 
47 SONOSITE, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
Income taxes 
Deferred income taxes are provided based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards arising since our inception. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount, if any, expected to be realized. 
Stock-based compensation
Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R, we accounted for those plans under the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Bulletin APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Accordingly, compensation cost related to stock option grants to employees had been recognized only to the extent that the fair market value of the stock exceeded the exercise price of the stock option at the date of the grant. We recognized compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock unit RSU grants ratably over the applicable vesting period. The fair value was based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant. We recorded share-based compensation related to stock options in accordance with the accelerated methodology described in Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans FIN 28.
On January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. SFAS 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions and requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows, in accordance with the provision of the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue No00-15, Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option. SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions
in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a cash provided by financing activities, rather than as an operating cash flow on a prospective basis, and therefore reduces cash provided by operating activities and increases cash providedby financing activities. This amount, determined using the method provided by SFAS 123R for awards that were vested as of January 1, 2006, is shown as Excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options on our consolidated statement of cash flows. Wehave adopted the long-haul method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits, under which we calculate on a grant by grant basis the windfall or excess tax benefit that arose upon exercise of each award based on a comparison to the total tax deduction to the as-if deferred tax asset that would have been recorded had we followed the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 since its effective date. We use a tax law ordering methodology for determining
when tax benefits from stock option exercises are realized. Total cash flows remain unchanged from what has been previously reported.

Net income per share
Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average of all common shares issued and outstanding, and is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic net income per share calculation plus the number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise of all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. 
The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share calculations in thousands, except per share amounts:

Accordingly, certain employee stock options and restricted stock units totaling approximately 344,000, 149,000 and 70,000 for years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average shares.

Recent accounting pronouncements
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken on a tax return. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes. We do not believe that the adoption of FIN 48 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements SAB 108, which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. SAB 108 is effective as of the end of our 2006 fiscal year, allowing a one-time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of January 1, 2006 for errors that were not deemed material, but are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 did not impact our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measures SFAS 157, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements, but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. We are currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS 157 to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities SFAS 159, including an amendment to FASB Statement No. 115. Under SFAS 159, entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period. The election, called the fair value option, will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years that begin after November 15, 2007. We are currently reviewing the provisions of SFAS 159to determine the impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
3. Technology Transfer and License Agreement with ATL 
We license ultrasound technology from ATL under a Technology Transfer and License Agreement executed at the time of our spin-off as a public company in 1998. Under that agreement, we took ownership of certain ultrasound technology developed as part of a government grant and also patent rights, which had been established or were being pursued for that technology. As part of this agreement, we also entered into a cross-license whereby we had the exclusive right to use certain ATL technology existing on April 6, 1998 or developed by ATL during the three-year period following April 6, 1998 in ultrasound systems weighing 15 pounds or less, and ATL had the exclusive right to use our technology existing on April 6, 1998 or developed by us during the same three-year period in ultrasound systems weighing more than 15 pounds. On April 6, 2003, this cross-license became nonexclusive and, except for the patented technology of each party, now
extends to all ultrasound systems regardless of weight. 
Our license from ATL bears a royalty equivalent to a percentage of the net sales of ultrasound products under fifteen pounds that use ATL technology. A reduction in the royalty percentage owed to ATL became effective in September 2004. Royalty payments are required through September 21, 2007. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we incurred a royalty expense to ATL of $22 million, $20 million and $26 million, which is included in cost of revenue.

561 6. Acquisitions
In May 2004, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common shares of SonoMetric Health, Inc. SonoMetric. The results of SonoMetrics operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. SonoMetrics primary product was designed to be used with ultrasound technology to measure the intima media thickness IMT of the carotid artery. Increased thickness of the IMT in the carotid artery is associated with an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis, which is a leading cause of heart disease. We sell a stand-alone version of the acquired software, SonoCalc, and incorporated the software into the MicroMaxx system. We believe this acquisition enhances the sales of our products in the cardiovascular disease diagnostic market.
We purchased all of SonoMetrics outstanding common shares for an immediate cash payment of $15 million, plus future cash payments of up to $45 million contingent upon the amount of revenue recognized from the sale of the software over the five-year period following the closing date of the acquisition. In addition to the immediate cash payment, we also incurred $04 million in acquisition-related expenses, bringing the initial aggregate purchase price to $19 million. We had accrued contingent payments of $07 million and $07 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, as a result of revenue recognized on the sale of the software. These contingent payments are recorded as additional goodwill. This business combination was not material to our operations.
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. As part of the consideration paid to SonoMetric, the company paid off the assumed liabilities upon closing.

Of the $18 million of acquired intangible assets, $13 million was assigned to existing software technology that is amortized using the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of seven years and $05 million was assigned to non-compete agreements with former shareholders of SonoMetric that is amortized using the straight-line basis over the term of the agreement of three years. Contingent payments that are made are recorded as additional goodwill.
In 2004, in connection with the reduction of our valuation allowance related to U.S. income taxes, we recorded additional goodwill of $07 million related to the SonoMetric acquisition.
At December 31, 2004, we held a 30% ownership interest in SonoSite China Medical. In April 2005, we acquired the remaining 70% of SonoSite China Medical for $04 million. The results of SonoSite China Medical operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. The estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition was $05 million primarily for indefinite-lived intangible assets, including $01 million of deferred tax assets. The indefinite-lived intangible asset represents reacquired distribution rights. We have determined that they have indefinite lives because there are no legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit their useful lives. We accounted for this acquisition in accordance with EITF Issue No. 04-01, Accounting for Preexisting Relationships between Parties to a Business Combination which provides that if certain
conditions are met the settlement of a preexisting relationship should be recorded separate from the business combination. We concluded that none of those conditions existed in this transaction and accordingly none of the amount was recorded as settlement of a preexisting relationship.
7. Goodwill and other intangible assets
As of December 31, 2006, goodwill was $25 million and intangible assets subject to amortization, which collectively had a remaining weighted average useful life of 40 years, were $09 million, net of accumulated amortization of $11 million. Amortization expense of $04 million, $04 million and $03 million related to intangible assets was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. Amortization expense of intangible assets is estimated to be $03 million in 2007, and $02 million per year in 2008, 2009 and 2010. As of December 31, 2006, indefinite-lived intangible assets were $05 million. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed our annual impairment assessment of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined that they were not impaired. 
8. Hedging activities
We periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on cash flows and earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes. These contracts are not designated as hedges under SFAS 133 and therefore, are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings. These contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures, generally three months. Any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transactions. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
The currencies hedged during 2006 were the British pound, the Euro, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. As of December 31, 2006, we had $325 million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts. The fair value of these contracts as of December 31, 2006 was not material to our results of operations or financial position. These contracts expire on January 29, 2007 or March 30, 2007 and serve as economic hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the USD. Net recognized gains losses from foreign currency forward contracts for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $11 million, $23 million and $20 million, and are included in other income loss in the consolidated statements of operations. These gains and losses were substantially offset by foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances.

9. Shareholders equity 
Stock compensation plans
At December 31, 2006, we had seven stock-based employee compensation plans: the 1998 Nonofficer Employee Stock Option Plan 1998 NOE Plan, the 1998 Stock Option Plan 1998 Plan, the Nonemployee Director Stock Option Plan Director Plan, the Management Incentive Compensation Plan MIC Plan, the Adjustment Plan, the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan 2005 Plan and the 2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2005 ESPP Plan. Additionally, through 2004, we granted a total of 165,000 options outside of these plans to corporate officers, which are included within the information presented herein and contain similar provisions to our 1998 Plan.
Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $73 million, $03 million and $01, respectively, before income taxes.Stock-based compensation expense relatesto stock options of $40 million, RSU awards of $27 million and the employee stock purchase plan of $06 million in 2006,RSU awards of $04 million net of the reversal of stock options of $01 million in 2005, and stock options of $01 million in 2004. The related deferred tax benefit was $23 million and $01 million for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. The amount of stock-based compensation capitalized to inventory was not material as of December 31, 2006.
Under the 1998 NOE Plan, 1998 Plan, MIC Plan, 2005 Plan and option grants outside our stock option plans, as of December 31, 2006, 2,797,851 total shares of common stock were authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options at prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. As of December 31, 2006, 539,356 shares were available for grant under these stock option plans. In most cases, stock options issued prior to October 22, 2002 are exercisable at 25% each year over a four-year vesting period and have a ten-year term from the grant date. In October 2002, our Board of Directors approved a change in the vesting schedule for employee option grants made after October 22, 2002 so that first-time grants issued to new employees vest 25% after one year of employment and then monthly over the next three years, and grants made to employees after their first year of employment vest monthly over
four years. 
Under the Director Plan, as of December 31, 2004, 125,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance of stock options at prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. At December 31, 2004, there were no longer shares available for grant under this Plan. Stock options are exercisable and vest in full one year following their grant date provided the optionee has continued to serve as our director. Each option expires on the earlier of ten years from the grant date or 90 days following the termination of a directors service as our director.
The 2005 ESPP Plan, which qualifies under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits all U.S. based employees to purchase shares of our common stock. Participating employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at the end of each participation period at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or the end of the participation period. As of December 31, 2006 1,000,000 shares of common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2005 ESPP Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, 76,907 and 28,251 shares of common stock were issued under this plan, respectively.
We also have an Adjustment Plan, which includes options granted in connection with the dividend distribution occurring on April 6, 1998. As part of this distribution, existing ATL option holders received one of our options for every six ATL options held. There was no change to the intrinsic value of the option grant, ratio of exercise price to market value, vesting provisions or option period as a result of the distribution. As of December 31, 2006, 6,322 shares of common stock were authorized primarily for issuance upon exercise of stock options at prices equal to the fair market value of our common shares at the date of grant. 
Prior to the spin-off from ATL, we had no stock option plans specifically identified as our plans. All stock options granted through that date were part of ATL option plans. 
In 2003, we granted 10,000 options to a non-employee and, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based Compensation SFAS 123 and EITF Issue No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services, calculated the fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following assumptions for the year ended December 31, 2004: expected volatility of 60%, risk-free interest rate of 42%, term of 91 years, and zero dividend yield. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded stock-based compensation expense related to these options of $139,000 in accordance with the accelerated methodology described in FIN 28. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we determined that the vesting requirements of the 10,000 options would not be met. Accordingly,
we reversed $102,000 in previously recorded stock-based compensation expense.

204 In 2004, we recognized $44 million of stock-based compensation expense offset by a $132 million tax benefit, which resulted from the reversal of the valuation allowance on U.S. deferred taxes. In years prior to 2004, there was no reduction of the expense for the related tax benefit because we retained a full valuation allowance offsetting the deferred taxes. The reversal of that valuation allowance in 2004 resulted in a tax benefit for pro forma disclosure.
Our results for prior years have not been restated.
The fair value for stock option awards was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004

The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over the historical period commensurate with the expected term assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with an equivalent remaining term. The Company has not paid dividends in the past and does not plan to pay any dividends in the near future.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our experience. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 123R, we changed our method of attributing the value of stock-based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple-optionmethod to the straight-line single-option method. Compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted on or prior to December 31, 2005 will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple-option method, while compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005 will be recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on the Companys historical experience and future expectations. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the
effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized as the forfeitures occurred.

We have granted RSU awards to employees under the 1998 Plan and the 2005 Plan. Generally, the vesting period for our RSU awards is three years from the date of grant. As of December 31, 2006, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSU awards was $88 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 23 years. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded stock-based compensation expense related to these RSU awards of $27 million,net of$01 million of cumulative catch up adjustment that reduced the expense for the effect of estimated forfeitures.

Stock purchase rights 
In April 1998, we and First Chicago Trust Company of New York First Chicago entered into a Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement was subsequently amended in October 2001 to reflect that EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. had succeeded First Chicago as the rights agent, and in August 2003, to reflect certain changes approved by our Board of Directors. The Rights Agreement has certain anti-takeover provisions, which will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us. Under the Rights Agreement, each of our shareholders has one share purchase right for each share of common stock held, with each right having an exercise price approximating our board of directors estimate of the long-term value of one share of our common stock. The rights are triggered if an acquiror acquires, or successfully makes a tender offer for, 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. In such event, each shareholder
other than the acquiror would have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of newly issued shares of our capital stock at a 50% discount. If the acquiror were to acquire 50% or more of our assets or earning power, each shareholder would have the right to purchase, at the exercise price, a number of shares of acquirors stock at a 50% discount. Our board of directors may redeem the rights at a nominal cost at any time before a person acquires 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, which allows board-approved transactions to proceed. In addition, our board of directors may exchange all or part of the rights other than rights held by the acquiror for such number of shares of our common stock equal in value to the exercise price. Such an exchange produces the desired dilution without actually requiring our shareholders to purchase shares.

25,959 The valuation allowance on deferred taxes decreased by $40 millionin 2006, decreased by $10 million in 2005 and decreased by $237 million in 2004.
We have no valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not the deferred assets will be realized. The effect of the removal of the valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets in 2004, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance on foreign NOL carryovers, was a reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2004 of $237 million.
The valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets was eliminated in 2006 because current operations and recent earnings history indicate that realization of the related deferred tax assets are now more likely than not to occur.
For income tax purposes, our results through the spin-off from ATL were included in the consolidated federal income tax return of ATL and, accordingly, the net operating loss NOL generated prior to the spin-off from ATL is not available to us for use in periods subsequent to that date. During the period from the spin-off from ATL through December 31, 2006 we accumulated U.S. federal income tax NOL carryforwards of $476 million that begin expiring in 2019 and will be fully expired in 2025 and foreign NOL carryforwards of $107 million, of which $103 million are perpetual in nature and $04 expirein 2014. Additionally, we accumulated research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of $25 million that will expire between 2018 and 2026 and alternative minimum tax credits of $04 million that are perpetual in nature.
We have not provided for U.S. deferred taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as such earnings are deemed permanently reinvested. Determination of unrecorded deferred taxes on earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries is not practicable.
Under certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the availability and utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to limitation if it should be determined that there has been a change in ownership of more than 50%.
11. Employee Benefit Plan 
401k Retirement Savings Plan 
All our employees in the U.S. are eligible to participate in our 401k Plan. Terms of the 401k Plan permit an employee to contribute up to a maximum of 16% of an employees annual compensation on a post-tax or pre-tax basis, up to the maximum permissible by the Internal Revenue Service during any plan year. We match each employees contribution in increments equivalent to 100% for the first 3% and 50% for the second 3% of the employees contribution percentage. In 2006, 2005 and 2004 we contributed $13 million, $10 million and $09 million in matching contributions to the 401k Plan in accordance with the plans terms. Employees immediately vest in the contributions the employee makes. Vesting in our contribution on behalf of the employee occurs at equal increments at the end of each year of the first five years of an employees service with us.

12. Commitments and contingencies 
Indemnification Obligations and Guarantees excluding product warranty

Other commitments 
In 2005, we entered into an agreement to contribute up to $10 million to a research university. This pledge, which is to be paid over a four-year period, is conditioned upon our election to make a payment on an annual basis. We paid $03 million in 2006 and $01 million in 2005.
As part of our agreements with our suppliers, suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them. In the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing, material changes or design changes, we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements. As of December 31, 2006, these commitments were not significant. 
As part of obtaining our lease for our current facility, we are required to deposit $01 million, representing restricted cash with our bank. Additionally, at December 31, 2006 we maintained a deposit of $06 million with our bank in the United Kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges. Both amounts are included in other long-term assets.

In the U.S., we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing organizations GPO. Typically, a GPO negotiates with medical suppliers, such as us, on behalf of the GPOs member healthcare facilities, providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions. In exchange, the GPO identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members. Member facilities participating in the GPOs purchasing program can consist of hospitals, medical group practices, nursing homes, surgery centers, managed care organizations, long term care facilities, clinics and integrated delivery networks. Currently, we have GPO supply agreements with various groups including AmeriNet, Inc., Premier, Inc., Novation LLC, MedAssets HSCA, Inc., Broadlane, Inc. includes Kaiser Permanente, Tenet Healthcare and others and Consorta, Inc. These agreements require
us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of $14 million, $10 million and $05 million, respectively.
Contingencies 
In December 2006, a favorable judgment from a Federal U.S. District Court in Texas was affirmed at the appellate level in a patent infringement suit that had been pending against us since 2001. Following is a chronology of this lawsuit. On July 24, 2001, Neutrino Development Corporation Neutrino filed a complaint against us in U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent 6,221,021, or the 021 patent, by SonoSite as a result of our use, sale and manufacture of the SonoSite 180, SonoSite 180PLUS, SonoHeart and SonoHeart Plus devices the Original Products. Subsequently, the SonoHeart ELITE, iLook, TITAN and MicroMaxx systems were also added to the lawsuit the New Products. The complaint asserted claims for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining all alleged acts of infringement, compensatory and enhanced damages,
attorneys fees and costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On September 30, 2004, the Texas court ruled that SonoSites products infringed the 021 patent claims as previously construed by the court.
On March 21, 2006, the district court granted SonoSites motion for summary judgment of patent invalidity based on new matter. The district court found that Neutrino improperly amended the 021 patent in violation of the U.S. patent laws to include a description of a component being portable and sized to be handheld which was not disclosed in the original patent application. In a final judgment, the district court declared that the claims being asserted against SonoSite in the 021 patent are invalid for new matter, vacated and set aside its September 2004 ruling on infringement, and dismissed Neutrinos claims and causes of action with prejudice.
The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and oral argument on the appeal took place on December 5, 2006. On December 8, 2006, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the Texas courts summary judgment of invalidity in favor of SonoSite, and relied on the District Courts opinion instead of writing a new one. On December 15, 2006, Neutrino filed a motion for a panel rehearing and a motion for a rehearing en banc. The Court of Appeals denied both motions on January 19, 2007. On January 24, 2007, Neutrino filed a notice with the Texas district court of its intent to file a Petition of Certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. We have not yet seen the petition. Our motions to declare the case exceptional and to recover our attorneys fees and costs are pending in the Texas district court. We expense legal costs as incurred.

a Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
As of December 31, 2006, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act, and they have concluded that,due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting describedbelow,our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
b Managements report on internal control over financial reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 as required by the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15c.In making this assessment, our management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework.
A material weakness is defined as a significant deficiency, or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.
Our managements evaluation and assessment of our internal control over financial reporting concluded that internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2006, as a result of the following material weakness As of December 31, 2006, we did not have the appropriate level of expertise to properlyprepare and review our accounting for income taxes. As a result of this deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we did not detect errors in the measurement of income tax amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006. In addition, this deficiency resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of income taxes in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on managements assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report is included in Item 8. in the section titled Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
c Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
During 2006, we have made various improvements to our system of internal control. We continue to review, revise and improve the effectiveness of our internal controls. We have made no changes, other than the items noted below, in the Companys internal control over financial reporting in connection with our fourth quarter evaluation that would materially affect, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
During our fourth quarter of 2006, ourtax resources, who had the background and expertise in the tax provision preparation process, resigned. We continued to use a third party tax firm to provide expertise related to accounting and reporting for income taxes and plan to hire additional tax resources in 2007.
