37        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
Board of Directors and Shareholders
IMRglobal Corp. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IMRglobal Corp.
as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999, as restated for the 1999 pooling of
interests described in Note 2. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial
statements of IMRglobal Corp. for the year ended December 31, 1997, prior to
their restatements for the 1999 pooling of interests described in Note 2, which
statements reflect total revenue of $836 million for the year ended December
31, 1997. Those financial statements were audited by other auditors whose report
has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to data
included for IMRglobal Corp. and for the year ended December 31, 1997 prior to
the restatement for the 1999 pooling of interests described in Note 2, is based
solely on the report of other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of IMRglobal Corp. at
December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.                         Ernst & Young LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES     BASIS OF REPORTING--IMRglobal Corp. and subsidiaries IMRglobal or the
Company provide consulting and technology services to a variety of industries
and customers located primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IMRglobal Corp., and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.
The Company consolidated financial statements for 1998 and prior years
have been restated to include the financial statements of Atechsys, S.A. This
company was combined during 1999 in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of
interests Note 2.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS--IMRglobal considers all highly liquid
investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. IMRglobal maintains its investments at high quality financial
institutions.
MARKETABLE SECURITIES--All marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and are available to support current operations or to take
advantage of other investment opportunities. These securities are stated at
estimated fair value based upon market quotations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION--Fixed-price contract revenue and revenue from the
sale of software that requires significant modification is recognized using the
percentage of completion method of accounting, under which the sales value of
performance, including earnings thereon, is recognized on the basis of the
percentage that each contract cost to date bears to the total estimated cost.
Any anticipated losses upon contract completion are accrued currently. Service
revenue from time-and-materials services is recognized as the services are
provided.
Unbilled work-in-progress represents revenue on contracts to be billed
in subsequent periods in accordance with the terms of the contract. Deferred
revenue represents amounts billed in excess of revenue earned in accordance with
the terms of the contracts.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT--Property and equipment is stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is primarily computed using the
straight-line method and is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of
the respective assets.
GOODWILL--Goodwill arising from purchase business combinations is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over a 10 to 20 year period. IMRglobal
periodically reviews the value of its goodwill to determine if an impairment has
occurred. IMRglobal determines if the potential impairment of recorded goodwill
exists by the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flow in
relation to the assets to which this goodwill applies. If impairment of recorded
goodwill does exist, IMRglobal adjusts the recorded goodwill to fair market
value.                    44                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED     CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS--Capitalized software costs are recorded at
cost less accumulated amortization. Production costs for computer software that
is to be utilized as an integral part of a product or process is capitalized
when both a technological feasibility is established for the software and b
all research and development activities for the other components of the product
or process have been completed.
Amortization is included in cost of revenue and is charged to income
based upon a revenue formula over the shorter of the remaining estimated
economic life of the product or estimated lifetime revenue of the product.
Amortization of capitalized software costs was approximately $19 million 47,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999,
respectively. At December 31, 1998 and 1999 accumulated amortization for
capitalized software costs was $-0-.
INCOME TAXES--IMRglobal uses the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are
recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at
each year-end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to
the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A
valuation allowance is provided against the future benefit of deferred tax
assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the future tax
benefits associated with the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION--The financial statements of IMRglobal
foreign subsidiaries use a functional currency which is other than the U.S.
dollar and are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and
liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates in effect
during the year. The resulting translation adjustments are not included in
determining net income but are included in accumulated other comprehensive
income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reported in other
income but are not material to any period presented.
COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE--Basic earnings per share is computed
using the weighted average of common stock outstanding. For the year ended
December 31, 1999 the effect of incremental shares from common stock equivalents
is not included in the calculation of net loss per share as the inclusion of
such equivalents would be anti-dilutive. For 1997 and 1998 diluted earnings per
share reflects the dilutive effect of stock options computed using the treasury
stock method as follows in thousands                                      YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED     STOCK BASED COMPENSATION--IMRglobal follows the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB
Opinion No. 25, for stock issued under its stock option plans Note 13.
USE OF ESTIMATES--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates for IMRglobal for 1997, 1998 and 1999 include the
estimated useful life of goodwill for purchase acquisitions, estimation of
valuation allowances for income taxes and estimation of costs to complete for
fixed-price projects.
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME--During 1998, IMRglobal adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
Comprehensive income is comprised primarily of foreign currency translation
adjustments. Foreign currency translation adjustments have not been tax effected
because IMRglobal considers foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS--During June, 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
SFAS No. 133, which is effective for IMRglobal on January 1, 2001. This
statement establishes measurement and disclosure criteria for certain derivative
and hedging instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts. Management
is currently assessing the future impact of SFAS No. 133 on IMRglobal
financial statements.
RECLASSIFICATIONS--Certain amounts in the 1997 and 1998 financial
statements have been reclassified to conform with the 1999 presentation.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED     LINK GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT RESOURCES U.K.
LIMITED IMRglobal-U.K.--On February 10, 1997 effective January 8, 1997,
IMRglobal acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Link Group Holdings Limited
Link, a United Kingdom Limited Liability Company. Link provided transitional
software outsourcing solutions to the information technology departments of
large businesses located in the U.K. Prior to the acquisition, Link was owned by
a Board member of IMRglobal and his spouse.
In exchange for Link common stock, Link shareholders received $21
million in cash and 161,343 shares valued at $16 million of IMRglobal
common stock. In addition, a $16 million deferred cash payment was made to
Link former shareholders during February, 1998. The Link acquisition is
accounted for as a purchase pursuant to the provisions of APB Opinion No. 16.
Coincident with the above acquisition, IMRglobal also acquired 105% of
Information Management Resources U.K. Limited IMRglobal-Ltd., a United
Kingdom Limited Liability Company, from IMRglobal majority shareholder and his
spouse for $520,000 in cash. The purchase price was determined through
negotiations between IMRglobal and the shareholder and his spouse. The
acquisition from IMRglobal majority shareholder is accounted for as a
reduction of equity.
Prior to the above acquisitions, IMRglobal owned 395% of IMRglobal-Ltd.
and Link owned 50% of IMRglobal-Ltd. After the above acquisitions IMRglobal owns
100% of both Link and IMRglobal-Ltd. The operations of Link and IMRglobal-Ltd.
have been merged and the operating company was renamed IMRglobal, plc
IMRglobal-U.K.
IMRGLOBAL NORTHERN IRELAND LIMITED--During June 1997, IMRglobal began
operations in Belfast, Northern Ireland and acquired certain assets in exchange
for $270,000 cash and 11,250 shares of IMRglobal stock. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase pursuant to the provisions of APB Opinion No. 16.
During 1999, IMRglobal decided to close this facility as part of a restructuring
plan Note 16.
LYON CONSULTANTS, S.A.--During May, 1998, IMRglobal acquired 100% of the
outstanding stock of Lyon Consultants, S.A. Lyon, a privately held software
engineering company headquartered in Paris, France. Lyon specializes in rapid
software application development utilizing reusable business and technical
software objects, and information technology consulting. In exchange for Lyon
common stock, Lyon shareholders received $167 million in cash and 531,353
shares valued at $130 million of IMRglobal unregistered common stock. Of
the above purchase price, $700,000 of cash and 32,000 shares of IMRglobal
common stock were remitted one year after the acquisition date. In addition,
IMRglobal may have to make an additional payment to the former stockholders of
Lyon Note 19 under a contingency provision based upon future market price of
IMRglobal common stock. Any additional consideration ultimately payable under
this provision will be accounted for at fair value when the contingency is
resolved as an adjustment to the value of the shares originally issued to
Lyon shareholders. These amounts are included in the determination of the
purchase price. The Lyon acquisition is accounted for as a purchase pursuant to
the provisions of APB Opinion No. 16.                    47                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CONTINUED     IMRglobal allocated the purchase price of Lyon based on the fair value
of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Significant portions of the
purchase price were identified as intangible assets in independent appraisals,
using proven valuation procedures and techniques. These intangible assets
include approximately $82 million for acquired in-process research and
development IPRD for projects that did not have future alternative uses and
$27 million for developed technology. This allocation represents the estimated
fair value based on risk-adjusted cash flows related to the acquired in-process
research and development projects that give explicit consideration to the SEC
Staff views on in-process research and development as set forth in the
September 15, 1998 letter to the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. At the date of the acquisition the development of the IPRD projects
had not yet reached technological feasibility and the IPRD in progress had no
alternative future use. Accordingly, these costs were expensed as of the
acquisition date. The acquired developed technology is being amortized over a
5-year period.
Concurrent with the acquisition of Lyon, IMRglobal entered into a
noncancellable 3 year licensing agreement with a seven year renewal option, with
Wyde S.A. Wyde, an unrelated French company. Wyde provides the base
technology upon which the Lyon components have been developed. The licensing
agreement provides for the transfer of Wyde computer code and technology to
IMRglobal if Wyde should terminate its business. The amount of the licensing
fees is dependent on the value of company work sold and the countries where the
technology is utilized. Future minimum licensing fees payable to Wyde are
$400,000 in 2000.
RHO TRANSFORMATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES PTY LIMITED--During June, 1998,
IMRglobal acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of RHO Transformational
Technologies Pty Limited RHO, a privately held software services and
engineering company headquartered in Sydney, Australia. RHO specializes in
software application conversion and maintenance services, utilizing proprietary
tools and provides these services to large global companies with Australian and
Asia Pacific operations. In exchange for RHO common stock, RHO stockholders
received 285,000 shares of IMRglobal common stock. The RHO acquisition is
being accounted for as a pooling of interests in accordance with the provisions
of APB Opinion No. 16. Costs of approximately $145,000 related to the
acquisition have been charged to acquisition costs and are included in the
statement of operations.
The financial statements for 1997 have not been restated for the RHO
acquisition due to the immateriality of this transaction. The impact was a
reduction to the 1998 opening retained earnings and comprehensive income of
$69,000 and $59,000, respectively. These amounts are included in common stock
issued in connection with business combinations.
VISUAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION--On October 2, 1998, IMRglobal

business combination. Costs of approximately $22 million related to the
acquisition have been charged to acquisition costs and included in the statement

assets include approximately $34 million for acquired in-process research and

$33 million for developed technology. This allocation represents the estimated

differences between amortized cost and estimated fair value at December 31, 1998

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
10. CREDIT FACILITIES   REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES
During December 1999 and as subsequently amended IMRglobal entered into
a $30 million revolving credit facility expiring in February 2003. This credit
facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 06% currently 62% and is
collateralized by virtually all of the assets of IMRglobal. The interest rate
may be increased by up to an additional 115% based on certain financial ratios
of IMRglobal. This credit facility, as amended, contains covenants requiring
IMRglobal to achieve specific levels of earnings and to maintain specific
balance sheet ratios. At December 31, 1999, IMRglobal was in compliance with
these loan covenants. At December 31, 1999, the amount outstanding on this
credit facility was $92 million.
Certain subsidiaries of IMRglobal maintain additional revolving credit
line arrangements. Interest rates are based on the lending institution prime
rate ranging from 85% to 100% at December 31, 1999. At December 31, 1998 and
1999, the amount outstanding on these credit facilities was $443,000 and $11
million, respectively. The maximum amount available under these facilities at
December 31, 1999 was approximately $33 million. The respective subsidiaries
accounts receivable and certain property and equipment collateralize these
facilities.
The weighted average interest rate of the above credit facilities as of
December 31, 1999 was 64%.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11. INCOME TAXES CONTINUED     As reflected above IMRglobal has recorded a valuation allowance of
$450,000 and $83 million, respectively, against the deferred tax asset which is

As of December 31, 1999, IMRglobal had approximately $379 million of
U.S. net operating loss carryforwards for regular income tax purposes which will
expire between 2013 and 2015. The net operating loss primarily resulted from the
deductible expense recognized for income tax purposes upon stock option
exercises.
During the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, various
non-statutory stock options were exercised resulting in tax benefits net of any
valuation allowance of approximately $68 million, $209 million and $17
million, respectively, which were directly credited to shareholders' equity.
Under the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 the Act, a substantial
portion of IMRglobal-India income is exempt from Indian Income Tax as profits
attributable to export operations or a tax holiday expiring in 2007. Under the
Act, there are certain alternative minimum tax provisions which impose tax on
net profits at a rate of 105%. Management has determined that these provisions
are not currently applicable due to the tax holiday. Accordingly, the effective
tax rate imposed on IMRglobal-India income is substantially less than the
current statutory rate of 35%.
Undistributed earnings of IMRglobal foreign subsidiaries amounted to
approximately $38 million at December 31, 1999. These earnings are considered to
be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for United States
federal and state income taxes has been provided thereon. On remittance, certain
countries impose withholding taxes that, subject to certain limitations, are
then available for use as tax credits against a U.S. tax liability, if any.
Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred United States income tax
liability or foreign tax withholding is not practicable because of the
complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.                    59                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS     On June 17, 1997 and March 9, 1998, IMRglobal declared 3-for-2 stock
splits in the form of stock dividends payable on July 10, 1997 and April 3,
1998, respectively, to shareholders of record on June 26, 1997 and March 20,
1998, respectively. All applicable share and per share amounts in the
accompanying financial statements have been retroactively adjusted.
During July 1997, IMRglobal completed a public offering and received
$525 million in cash net of offering expenses of $600,000 in exchange for the
issuance of 2,587,500 shares of common stock.
On May 29, 1998, the shareholders approved an amendment of IMRglobal
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of shares
of IMRglobal Common Stock authorized for issuance from 40,000,000 to
100,000,000 shares.
EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN--IMRglobal has granted certain employees
non-qualified stock options with vesting periods of up to five years. On May 29,
1998, the shareholders approved an increase in the number of shares of Common
Stock available for grant under this plan from 123 million to 160 million.
These options give the employees the right to purchase common stock at an
exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the stock at the date
of the option grant. All options granted expire 7 to 10 years from their grant
date.
NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK OPTION PLAN--During September 1996,
IMRglobal established the Nonemployee Directors Stock Option Plan, whereby
nonemployee directors may be granted non-qualified options to purchase common
stock. The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under this
plan is 337,500. The exercise price of the stock option may not be less than the
fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Each nonemployee
director is granted an option of 22,500 shares for each two year period they
serve on the Board. The options expire 10 years from the grant date. Beginning
with the grant date, these options vest 50% at the end of the first year and
100% at the end of the second year. As of December 31, 1999, 225,000 options are
available for future grants and 90,000 options are outstanding, of which 67,500
are exercisable.
During August, 1999, the Board of Directors authorized the creation of
a second Stock Option Plan. This plan was primarily created to provide
non-qualified stock options to employees of newly acquired companies. This plan
excludes executive officers and directors of IMRglobal. The number of shares of
common stock authorized for issuance under this plan is 2,000,000 shares.                    61                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS CONTINUED     STOCK OPTION DISCLOSURES--IMRglobal applies APB Opinion No. 25 and
related interpretations in accounting for stock options. Accordingly, no
compensation cost has been recognized in connection with the issuance of these
options. Had compensation cost for IMRglobal stock option plan been determined
based on the fair value at the grant dates for the awards under the plan
consistent with the method of SFAS Statement No. 123, IMRglobal net income and
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 would
have been reduced to the adjusted amounts indicated below                             1997     1998     1999

effects on reported net income for future years.
The estimated per share fair value of options granted during 1997, 1998
and 1999 was $1246, $1712 and $1056, respectively. The fair value of each
option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions for grants
in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively: no dividend yield for each year presented;
risk-free interest rates of 60%, 53% and 57%; expected lives of the options
prior to exercise of 65, 55 and 55 years. For options granted prior to
IMRglobal initial public offering in November, 1996, volatility of the stock
price was omitted from the pricing model as permitted by SFAS No. 123. For 1997,
1998 and 1999 option grants, a volatility measure of 85%, 92% and 88 respectively, was employed.                    62                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN--IMRglobal Employee Stock Purchase Plan
the Stock Purchase Plan became effective on October 1, 1996. A total of
450,000 shares of IMRglobal Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under
the Stock Purchase Plan. An employee electing to participate in the Stock
Purchase Plan must authorize a stated dollar amount or percentage of the
employee regular pay to be deducted by IMRglobal from the employee pay for
the purpose of purchasing shares of Common Stock on a quarterly basis. The price
at which employees may purchase Common Stock is 85% of the closing price of the
Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market on the first day of the quarter or
the last day of the quarter, whichever is lower.                    64                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS CONTINUED     IMRGLOBAL-INDIA STOCK OPTION PLAN--IMRglobal-India had a separate
Employee Share Option Policy which provided for grants of options to employees
to purchase common shares of IMRglobal-India. Under the policy, options granted
to an employee vest upon completion of five years of continuous employment with
IMRglobal-India or its affiliates. Vested options are valid for exercise during
the employees' employment with IMRglobal-India or its affiliates and for a
period of six months thereafter. Options that are not exercised within six
months of cessation of employment expire. This plan was terminated during 1998.

14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS     Defined contribution plans cover employees in the United States and
certain other countries, including Australia, France and India. Employees may
contribute to these plans and IMRglobal matches these contributions in varying
amounts. Defined contribution pension expense for the years ended December 31,
1997, 1998 and 1999 was $327,000, $13 million and $25 million, respectively.
During 1998, IMRglobal established a deferred compensation plan which
allows certain U.S. employees to defer portions of their annual compensation.
These assets are placed in a rabbi trust and are presented as assets of
IMRglobal as they are available to the general creditors of IMRglobal in the
event of IMRglobal insolvency. The value of the assets at December 31, 1998
and 1999 was $28 million and $64 million, respectively, and is included in
other assets. The related liability at December 31, 1998 and 1999 was $18
million and $28 million, respectively, and is included in accrued compensation.
The assets are invested in variable life insurance products. At December 31,
1999 book value approximated fair value.                    65                 IMRGLOBAL CORP.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK     Financial instruments which potentially subject IMRglobal to
concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities and trade receivables. IMRglobal maintains its cash with
high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution. IMRglobal places its cash
equivalents and marketable securities in investment grade short-term debt
instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one commercial
issuer.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited due to the dispersion of IMRglobal customer base across different
industries and geographies. IMRglobal two largest customers accounted for
approximately 16%, 15% and 11% of revenue in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively,
and 4% and 55% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 1998 and 1999,
respectively. No other customer accounted for 10% of revenue or accounts
receivable for the above periods.
16. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE     In the fourth quarter of 1999, IMRglobal implemented a restructuring
plan to redeploy resources to exploit its expanding e-business service offering
and better align its organization with its corporate strategy. The restructuring
plan included the closure of two UK offices, the write-down of specific
mainframe software and hardware and the reduction of its global workforce. The
restructuring charge is summarized as follows in thousands                                  CASH     ACCRUED

related costs such that the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse
effect on IMRglobal future financial position.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES CONTINUED     During May 1998, IMRglobal acquired 100% of Lyon Consultants S.A.
Lyon for approximately $167 million in cash and 531,353 shares in IMRglobal
See Note 2. In addition, the acquisition agreement provides that if the
average price of the IMRglobal shares on NASDAQ is less than $2724 per share
for the seven trading days prior to May 15, 1999, then IMRglobal will pay the
former Lyon shareholders the difference between the average price on NASDAQ and
$2724 multiplied by 499,353 shares. On May 15, 1999 the average price of
IMRglobal shares for the seven trading days prior to May 10, 1999 was $18768
per share. Accordingly, the liability to the former shareholders of Lyon would
have been approximately $42 million at that date.
Subsequent to May 10, 1999, IMRglobal renegotiated this contingency.
IMRglobal current agreement is that if the average price of the IMRglobal
shares on NASDAQ is less than $3405 per share for the seven trading days prior
to May 15, 2000, then IMRglobal will pay the former Lyon shareholders the
difference between the average price on NASDAQ and $3405 for only the shares
continuing to be held by the former Lyon shareholders. Conversely, if the price
of IMRglobal shares on NASDAQ is $3405 per share or higher for any consecutive
trading days between May 15, 1999 and May 15, 2000, then the above contingency
is released without any further obligation to IMRglobal.
IMRglobal French subsidiary has claimed a special tax exemption for
the 1993 through 1995 fiscal years. The French taxing authorities have
challenged this exemption and have made an assessment of approximately $500,000.
Ongoing discussions are being held between IMRglobal French management and the
French taxing authorities regarding this issue. The amount of assessment 500,000, is included as a liability in the accompanying financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION IN THOUSANDS     IMRglobal operates several business units located in North America,
Europe and Asia for which financial information is maintained and reported to
the chief operating decision makers of the Company. In determining the reporting
segments of the Company, management has aggregated the business units that have
similar economic characteristics, products and services and types of customers.
IMRglobal has three reporting segments. The Information Technology
IT segment provides consulting and technology services to large companies in
North America, Europe and Asia. The Health Care Solutions segment provides
business and consulting services to clients in the health care industry.
