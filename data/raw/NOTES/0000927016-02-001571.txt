The Board of Directors and Shareholders
TranSwitch Corporation    We have audited the consolidated financial statements of TranSwitch
Corporation and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In connection
with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited
the financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying index. These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TranSwitch
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
July 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and certain
provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as required
for goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations
consummated after June 30, 2001. s/ KPMG LLP

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
TranSwitch Corporation TranSwitch or the Company was incorporated in
Delaware on April 26, 1988 and is headquartered in Shelton, Connecticut. The
Company and its subsidiaries collectively, TranSwitch or the Company
design, develop, market and support highly integrated digital and mixed-signal
semiconductor devices for the telecommunications and data communications
markets.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TranSwitch
Corporation and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things,
allowances for uncollectable receivables, inventory obsolescence, product
warranty, depreciation and amortization, taxes, and contingencies. Estimates and
assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are
reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are
determined to be necessary.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Investments in Marketable Securities
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or
less are considered cash equivalents. Cash equivalents were approximately $3702
and $4707 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Cash equivalents consist of overnight bank repurchase agreements,
certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury Bills, commercial paper and U.S. Agency
Notes. The majority of the Company cash and cash equivalents are maintained
with three major financial institutions. The cash, cash equivalents and
investment balances at institutions may, at times, be above the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation insured limit of $01 million per account.
Short and long-term investments are comprised of marketable securities,
primarily U.S. Treasury Bills, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities.
Investments with remaining maturities greater then ninety days, but less than
one year, as of the date of the balance sheet are considered short-term.
Long-term investments consist of the same mix of securities with maturity dates
greater than one year from the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2001 and
2000, all of the Company marketable securities are classified as
held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities in which the
Company has the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. These
investments are recorded at amortized cost.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value
because of their short maturities. The fair values of long-term investments and
the 4 1/2% Convertible Notes due 2005 are determined using quoted market prices
for those securities or similar financial instruments. The fair value of the
outstanding 4 1/2% Convertible Notes due 2005 was approximately $1785 and
$4000 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The fair value of
the Company long-term investments are disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements.                    44           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost on a weighted-average cost
basis or estimated net realizable value.
Product Licenses
Product licenses are amortized using the greater of: 1 the amount
computed using the ratio of a product current gross revenues to the product
total of current and estimated future gross revenues; or 2 or the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally
three to five years, not to exceed the term of the license. The Company
capitalized $20 million, $05 million and $10 million for the years ended
December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, in connection with the
acquisition of selected technologies. Amortization of product licenses amounted
to $03, $04 and $05 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively. Product licenses, net, are included in other assets on the
consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded an
impairment charge related to a product license, refer to note 11.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation
and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is
calculated using the half-year convention method over the asset estimated
useful lives, ranging from three to seven years. Any gain or loss resulting from
sale or retirement is included in the consolidated statement of operations.
Repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while renewals and betterments
are capitalized. Costs incurred for assets being constructed or installed but
not yet placed in service at the balance sheet date are recorded as construction
in progress.
Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets
Goodwill and purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less
accumulated amortization, and are being amortized over the estimated economic
lives of the respective assets, generally five to ten years. Accumulated
amortization for goodwill and purchased intangible assets amounted to $29
million and $04 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000. Refer
also to Recent Accounting Pronouncements below as well as note 2 Business
Combinations for additional disclosure.
Deferred Financing Costs
Deferred financing costs on our 4 1/2% Convertible Notes due 2005 are
amortized using the interest method over the term of the related notes. The
Company had deferred financing costs, net of $81 and $152 million at December
31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Amortization, included in the consolidated
statement of operations as a component of interest expense, was $27 million and
$11 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recognized a gain related
to the early extinguishment of convertible notes which were reduced by the
write-off of $45 million in associated deferred financing costs. Refer to note
10 for additional details on our 4 1/2% convertible notes due 2005.
Impairment of Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews long-lived assets, goodwill and certain identifiable
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When
factors indicate that an intangible or long-lived asset should be evaluated for
possible impairment, an estimate of the related asset undiscounted future cash
flows over the remaining life of the asset will be made to determine whether the
carrying value is recoverable. Any impairment is measured based upon the excess
of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value which is
generally based on an estimate of future discounted cash flows.                    45           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Investments in Non-Publicly Traded Companies
The Company has certain minority investments in the convertible preferred
stock of several non-publicly traded companies in which it has less than 20
percent of the voting rights and does not exercise significant influence. These
investments are carried at cost and are reviewed periodically for impairment.
The appropriate reductions in carrying values are recorded when and if
necessary. During the three years ended December 31, 2001, the Company did not
record any impairment charges on these investments.
Revenue Recognition
Net revenues are comprised of product shipments, principally to domestic
and international telecommunications and data communications OEMs and to
distributors. Net revenues from product sales are recognized at the time of
product shipment when the following criteria are met: 1 title and risk of loss
transfers to the customer; 2 the selling price is fixed or determinable; and
3 collectibility is reasonably assured.
Agreements with certain distributors provide price protection and return
and allowance rights. With respect to the sales to distributors the: 1 prices
are fixed at the date of shipment from the Company facilities; 2 payment is
not contractually or otherwise excused until the product is resold; 3 Company
does not have any obligations for future performance relating to the resale of
the product; and 4 amount of future returns, allowances, refunds and costs to
be incurred can and are reasonably estimated and accrued at the time of
shipment.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,
marketable securities, and accounts receivable.
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are maintained in
investment grade financial instruments with high-quality financial institutions,
thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. In addition, the Company limits the
amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and any one type of
investment.
At December 31, 2001, over 90% of accounts receivable were due from four
major customers. The majority of the Company sales are to customers in the
telecommunications and data communications industries. The Company performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral. The Company does establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based
upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical
trends and other information.
Product Warranties
TranSwitch provides warranties on its products for up to one year from the
date of sale. A liability is recorded for estimated costs to be incurred under
product warranties, which is based primarily on historical experience. Estimated
warranty expense is recorded as cost of revenues as products are sold.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that                    46           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Stock-Based Compensation
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
the Company accounts for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and FASB Interpretation No. 44 FIN 44, Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock-Based Compensation, an interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation related to
non-employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in
accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its interpretations. Expense associated with
stock-based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of each individual
award.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are based upon the weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assume exercise of all
outstanding in-the-money stock options and the conversion of the 4 1/2%
Convertible Notes due 2005 into common stock at the beginning of the period or
the date of issuance, if later, unless they are anti-dilutive.
Foreign Currency Translation
All foreign subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional
currency. Therefore, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and
expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income loss. Gains and losses related to monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in a currency different than a subsidiary functional
currency are included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications have been made in the 2000 balance sheet to
conform to the 2001 presentation.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS 141. SFAS 141 requires that the
purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated
after June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 also specifies certain criteria that must be met
in order for intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business
combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill, noting that any
purchase price allocable to an assembled workforce may not be accounted for
separately. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 141 as of July 1, 2001.
Accordingly, for the acquisition of Onex, the Company recorded $406 million in
goodwill which is not being amortized. Refer also to note 2 of these
consolidated financial statements.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS 142 which is effective
for TranSwitch fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among
other things, the discontinuance of goodwill amortization. In addition, the
standard includes provisions, upon adoption, for the reclassification of certain
existing recognized intangibles as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of
existing recognized intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of
previously reported goodwill and the testing for impairment of existing goodwill
and other intangibles. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, the Company will cease to
amortize approximately $545 million of goodwill and assembled workforce
intangible assets. The Company had recorded approximately $25 million of
amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately
$26 million of amortization during 2002. In lieu of                    47           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued

amortization, the Company will be required to perform an impairment review of
its goodwill balance upon the initial adoption of SFAS 142. The Company expects
to complete the initial review during the second quarter of 2002. The Company
does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial
review, however there can be no assurance that at the time the review is
completed a material impairment loss will not be recorded. Any impairment loss
will be measured as of the date of adoption and recognized as the cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle.
In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144 supercedes SFAS 121 Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.
SFAS 144 applies to all long-lived assets including discontinued operations
and consequently amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 APB 30,
Reporting Results of Operations -Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Division
of a Business. SFAS 144 develops one accounting model for long-lived assets that
are to be disposed of by sale and requires that long-lived assets that are to be
disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less
cost to sell. Additionally, SFAS 144 expands the scope of discontinued
operations to include all components of an entity with operations that 1 can
be distinguished from the rest of the entity and 2 will be eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction. SFAS 144 is
effective for TranSwitch fiscal year beginning January 1, 2002. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its
financial statements.
Note 2. Business Combinations
During the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company completed
five acquisitions. All acquisitions during 2001 and 2000 were accounted for
under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations, with the
exception of EASICS NV which was accounted for as a pooling of interests during
2000. The consolidated financial statements include the operating results of
each business from the date of acquisition, except EASICS NV where historical
balances are reflected. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.

Onex Communications Corporation
On September 21, 2001 the Company acquired Onex, which develops
System Silicon Solutions for multi-service platforms. This acquisition was
a strategic investment aimed at enhancing the Company product offering
with higher speed solutions. As a result of this acquisition, the Company
issued 5,481,504 shares of its common stock and assumed 523,543 common
stock options. The common stock issued was valued at the closing price of
$880 per share as listed on the Nasdaq National Market on the date that
the definitive merger agreement was signed August 17, 2001 as the number
of common shares to be issued were fixed on that date. This equates to a
total fair value of $528 million in common stock. The Company also paid

$51 million accounted for under the cost method, brings the Company
total purchase price of Onex to $814 million.
Purchased In-Process Research and Development
The $220 million allocated to IPR was determined through
independent valuations using established valuation techniques in our
industry. The value allocated to IPR was based upon the forecasted
operating after-tax cash flows from the technology acquired, giving
effect to the stage of completion at the acquisition date. Future
cash flows were adjusted for the value contributed by any core
technology and development efforts expected to be completed post
acquisition. These forecasted cash flows were then discounted at
rates commensurate with the risks involved in completing the
acquired technologies taking into consideration the characteristics
and applications of each product, the inherent uncertainties in
achieving technological feasibility, anticipated levels of market
acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to
the impact of potential changes in future target markets. After
considering these factors, the risk adjusted discount rates for the
Onex products were determined to be 30%. Acquired technology that
had not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no
alternative future uses existed was expensed upon acquisition. The
in-process technology acquired from Onex consisted of two projects:
Switch Processor SP and Switch Element SE. These projects are
further described as follows          The SP technology consists of highly integrated and
programmable silicon that can combine any and all combinations of
SONET/SDH transmission and native support for TDM, ATM and packet
processing on a single chip. Significant features under development
of the SP technology include the fact that SP is a 17 million gate
device. The portion of in-process research and development allocated
to this project was $141 million. It was estimated that the SP
project was approximately 60% complete and the remaining costs to
complete the project were $49 million. This project is expected to
be completed in April 2002. The risks associated with the
development of SP product are technical completion, timing, cost,
and market risks. Technical completion must bear the risk that the
technology back-end layout is appropriate. Timing risk of
developing the SP is significant due to the unpredictable nature of
technical issues with such technology. Although a market exists for
this type of product, producing the SP product cost-effectively and
gaining general market acceptance has yet to be proven and presents
risk to the success of the SP product.
The SE technology consists of a 30 Gbps 12 port OC-48 switch
technology capable of switching TDM, ATM or variable length packet
traffic. Significant features under development of the SE technology
include frequency and phase synchronization. The portion of
in-process research and development allocated to this project was
$79 million. It was estimated that the SE technology was
approximately 75% complete and the remaining costs to complete the
project were $27 million. The initial development of this project
was completed in December 2001 and was in the process of being
tested at year end. The risks associated with the development of SE
product are technical completion, timing, cost, and market risks.
Technical completion for the initial prototype lots centers on the
reliability of IBM Unilink technology. Although a market for the
SE product exists, producing the SE product cost-effectively and
gaining general market acceptance has yet to be proven and presents
risk to the success of the product.
Goodwill
The excess purchase price, including the Company original
investment in Onex, over the fair value of the net identifiable
assets and liabilities acquired of $406 million has been recorded
as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141 and SFAS 142, the Company
is not amortizing this asset as the transaction was completed after
June 30, 2001, but will perform a periodic evaluation for
impairment.                    49           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

On February 6, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding
stock of Horizon Semiconductors, Inc. Horizon for 43,507 shares of
common stock valued at approximately $17 million, and $05 million of
cash paid to Horizon stockholders. The common stock issued was valued at
the average closing price of $3847 per share as listed on the Nasdaq
National Market for the twenty trading days immediately preceding the two
trading days prior to the closing date in accordance with the purchase
agreement. The total purchase price of approximately $23 million includes
direct costs of the acquisition totaling approximately $02 million.
Horizon is a specialized design company for test and diagnostics
engineering and was acquired for the strategic value of its products and
processes to TranSwitch.
Goodwill of $21 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 5 years, and the assembled workforce of $02 million is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 3 years. As described in note 1,
upon full adoption of SFAS 142 as of January 1, 2002 the Company will no
longer amortize goodwill but perform periodic evaluations of impairment.
In addition, assembled workforce is not an intangible asset under SFAS 142
and will be combined with goodwill. Pro forma results of operations for
Horizon have not been presented because the effects of this acquisition
were not material to the financial statements either individually or
combined with other acquisitions.

EASICS NV
In May 2000, the Company completed a combination with EASICS NV, a
Belgian communications semiconductor design service provider, in which
Easics NV became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TranSwitch. The Company
issued 505,382 shares of common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding stock of EASICS NV. The transaction was accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the historical consolidated
financial statements were restated to include the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows of EASICS NV for all periods
presented. During the year ended December 31, 2000, merger-related
transaction costs of $12 million were recorded and included under merger
costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There were no
significant adjustments required to the accounting policies of EASICS NV.

valued, in the aggregate, at approximately $107 million. The total
purchase price of approximately $113 million also includes professional
fees and other direct costs of the acquisition totaling $06 million.
Alacrity specializes in the development and marketing of high-capacity
VLSI switching devices for telecommunications and data communications
applications. The allocation of purchase price among tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows       Tangible assets..   $  359

The amount allocated to in-process research and development of $28
million was expensed upon acquisition, as it was determined that the
underlying project had not reached technological feasibility, had no
alternative future use and successful development was uncertain. The
charge for IPR was based on a methodology that focused on the present
value of after-tax cash flows attributable to the in-process project
combined with the consideration of the stage of completion of the
individual research and development project at the date of acquisition.                    51           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

o   No anticipated material changes from historical pricing margin and
expense levels.
To date, there have been no shipments related to this product or
changes in development that would require an adjustment to the valuation.

The valuation allowance of $123 million relates to state tax net
operating losses and federal and state research and development and other
credits which management believes it more likely than not will expire
unutilized. Subsequently recognized income tax benefits, if any, in the amount
of $38 million will be applied directly to additional paid-in capital and $06
million will be applied to reduce goodwill. Of the total deferred income tax
assets at December 31, 2001, $30 million is recorded as current and $655
million is recorded as non-current.
At December 31, 2001, the Company had available, for federal income tax
purposes, net operating loss NOL carryforwards of approximately $1262
million and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately
$72 million expiring in varying amounts from 2003 through 2021. For state
income tax purposes, the Company had available NOL carryforwards of
approximately $456 million and state tax credit carryforwards of $53 million
expiring in varying amounts from 2002 to 2021.
Certain transactions involving the Company beneficial ownership have
occurred which resulted in a stock ownership change for purposes of Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Consequently, approximately
$219 million of the NOL carryforwards and $14 million of research and
development tax credit carryforwards are subject to these limitations. However,
the Company believes it is more likely than not that the NOL carryforwards will
be utilized.
Note 8. Stockholders' Equity
Stockholders' Rights Plan
On October 1, 2001, the Board of Directors enacted a stockholder rights
plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right for each
outstanding share of TranSwitch common stock outstanding at the close of
business on October 1, 2001 to the stockholders of record on that date. Each
stockholder of record as of October 1, 2001 received a summary of the rights and
any new stock certificates issued after the record date contain a legend
describing the rights. Each preferred share purchase right entitles the
registered holder to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0001 per share, of the
Company, at a price of $5000 per one one-thousandth of a Preferred Share,
subject to adjustment, upon the occurrence of certain triggering events,
including the purchase of 15% or more of the Company outstanding common stock
by a third party. Until a triggering event occurs, the common stockholders have
no right to purchase shares under the stockholder rights plan. If the right to
purchase the preferred stock is triggered, the common stockholders will have the
ability to purchase sufficient stock to significantly dilute the 15% or greater
holder.                    57           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Stock-Based Compensation Fair Value Disclosures
As permitted by SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123, the Company applies APB 25 and related interpretations in accounting for
stock-based awards. Under APB 25, no compensation expense is recognized in the
financial statements for employee stock options because the exercise price of
the option equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
The Company is required under SFAS 123 to disclose pro forma information
regarding option grants made to employees based on specified valuation
techniques that produce estimated compensation charges. Pro forma information
under SFAS 123 is as follows                        Years ended December 31,
2001      2000     1999

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--Continued
Tabular dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing with the following assumptions                   2001     2000     1999
Risk-free interest rate..  47%     51%     67%
Expected life in years..  29     30     32
Expected volatility..  976%    858%    730%
Expected dividend yield..   --      --         The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected volatility of the stock price.
Because the Company stock-based awards have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its stock-based awards to employees.
The weighted average fair value of stock options granted, calculated using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, is $1186, $1903 and $616 for the
three years ended December 31, 2001.
As required by SFAS 123, the Company recognized compensation expense
related to stock options granted to non-employees of $09 million, $06 million,
and $06 million for each of the three years ended December 31, 2001,
respectively.
Employee 401k Plan
TranSwitch sponsors a 401k plan known as the TranSwitch Corporation
401k Retirement Plan the Plan. The Plan provides tax-deferred salary
deductions for eligible employees. Employees may contribute from 1% to 20% of
their annual compensation to the Plan, limited to an annual maximum amount as
set periodically by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company provides matching
contributions equal to 50% of the employees' deferred compensation, up to a
maximum of 6% of the employee annual compensation. All matching contributions
vest immediately. The contribution expense related to the Plan amounted to $06
million, $04 million and $03 million for each of the three years ended
December 31, 2001, respectively.
Note 10. 4 1/2% Convertible Notes due 2005 and Extraordinary Gain
In September 2000, the Company issued $460 million of 4 1/2% Convertible
Notes due September 12, 2005, and received proceeds of $444 million, net of debt

Plan and November 15, 2001 the November Plan due to current and
anticipated business conditions. These plans resulted in the elimination of
seventy-seven positions in North America and the closing of four office
buildings in Canada, Massachusetts and Connecticut. A summary and explanation of
the restructuring charges and outstanding liabilities are as follows                         July    November
Plan     Plan    Total
Restructuring Charges:

Long-term    --    26,925    26,925
Total Restructuring Liabilities.. $  --   $29,924   $29,924
The July Plan consisted of employee termination benefits of approximately
$13 million related solely to a workforce reduction of thirty positions in
North America and across all functional areas of the Company. These employees
were terminated during the third quarter of 2001 and provided severance and
related benefits. As of December 31, 2001, all obligations under the July Plan
have been paid.
The November Plan consisted of employee termination benefits of
approximately $19 million related to a workforce reduction of forty-seven
positions in North America and across all functional areas of the Company. These
employees were terminated during the fourth quarter of 2001 and provided
severance and related benefits. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has made
cash payments totaling approximately $06 million which have been charged
against the restructuring liabilities. The remaining $13 million in employee
termination obligations under this plan is included in current restructuring
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and is expected to be paid out
during the first quarter of 2002.                    62           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The November Plan also included the closing of two facilities in Shelton,
Connecticut, one facility in Stoneham, Massachusetts and one facility in
Montreal, Canada. The Company is obligated through fiscal 2017 for certain lease
commitments for the facilities that were exited. The Company has secured and is
in the process of negotiating sub-lease commitments with interested parties on a
portion of the excess space over the next several years. The space for which
there are no sub-lease commitments in place as of December 31, 2001, the Company
has taken a charge of $286 million which represents the remaining future
minimum lease payments and operating cost obligations related to these excess
facilities net of future expected sublease income. Of this outstanding rent
obligation, approximately $17 million is included in current restructuring
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and $269 million is included in
restructuring liabilities - long term on the consolidated balance sheets.
Excess furniture, leasehold improvements and equipment of $06 million was
written off in conjunction with these facility closures.
During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company also reduced the
asset carrying value of a technology product license and certain tooling by
approximately $17 million as a result of an impairment analysis performed
pursuant to SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and
for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.

1 As the Company recorded a loss in fiscal year 2001, the assumed
exercise of dilutive securities 43 million shares of in-the-money stock
options was not considered as they would have been anti-dilutive.
2 For purposes of calculating the dilutive earnings loss per share for
the year ended December 31, 2000, the assumed conversion of 4 1/2%
Convertible Notes due 2005 is not taken into consideration as its effect
is anti-dilutive. For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per
share had the 4 1/2% Convertible Notes due 2005 been converted,
approximately $62 and $38 million of interest expense after tax would
have been added to net income during the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Also, 5,072,000 and 2,476,000 additional shares of
common stock would have been assumed outstanding for the years ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.                    63           TRANSWITCH CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

through the end of fiscal 2002, it did not renew this line of credit and was
released from all its obligations, restrictions and financial covenants.
