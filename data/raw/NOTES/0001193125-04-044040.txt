30  REPORT OF ERNST YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  The Board of Directors and Stockholders Docent, Inc.  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Docent, Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a. These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Docent, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.  /s/ERNST YOUNG, LLP  San Jose, California January 23, 2004

36  DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  1. Organization and Basis of Presentation 
Docent, Inc. Docent or the Company is a provider of eLearning products and services that enable the exchange of knowledge
within and among large enterprises. Docents Internet-based platform provides for the delivery of learning content online.  All share and per share data included in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect a one-for-three reverse split
approved by the Companys Board of Directors in October 2002.  2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Principles
of consolidation  The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Docent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Use of estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis,
Docent evaluates estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible assets and restructuring. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid financial instruments consisting primarily of investments in money market funds and commercial
paper, with insignificant interest rate risk and with original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition.  Short-term investments  Short-term investments are stated at amounts that approximate fair value based on quoted market prices. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, management determines the appropriate classification of the debt securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the
designation as of each balance sheet date. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, Docent classified all of the debt securities as available-for-sale pursuant to SFAS No. 115. Short-term investments consist principally of taxable, short-term money market
instruments with maturities or callable dates between 90 days and one year.  Restricted cash  At
December 31, 2003, Docent had no restricted cash. At December 31, 2002, Docent had $46,000 of restricted cash attributable to a corporate credit card deposit. 
Fair value of financial instruments  Carrying amounts of certain of Docents financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amounts of notes payable and capital lease obligations approximate fair value based on the terms of similar borrowing arrangements available to
Docent.  Risks and uncertainties  Docent is subject to all of the risks inherent in a company that operates in
the intensely competitive Internet industry, providing a service is relatively new and constantly evolving. These risks include, but are not limited to, market acceptance of Docents products and services, and reliance on third-party
software incorporated in Docents products. Docents operating results may be materially affected by the foregoing factors. 
37  DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Concentration of credit risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject Docent to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash
equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Docents cash and cash equivalents are deposited with four financial institutions, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits.  Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers in a wide variety of
industries, primarily in the United States and Europe. Docent performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, does not require collateral and maintains allowances for potential credit losses when deemed necessary. To date, such losses have
been within managements expectations. At December 31, 2003, Docent had accounts receivable due from two customers of 12% and 10% of total accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, Docent had no accounts receivable due from a single customer
greater than 10% of total accounts receivable.  Revenue
recognition  Docent derives its revenue from the licensing
of its software, either through perpetual or time-based licenses, maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, including implementation, consulting and training.  In accordance with Statement of Position No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, issued by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants SOP 97-2, as amended, Docent recognizes revenue from licensing our software if all of the following conditions are met:  There is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;  We have delivered the product to the customer;  Collection of the fees is probable; and  The amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable. 
Revenue from sales to resellers is recognized upon the receipt of a purchase order or a sales contract from the reseller and when the end customer has
been identified, provided all the conditions for revenue recognition set forth above have been met. No right of return exists for these sales.  For arrangements requiring customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written
notice of acceptance is received from the customer.  Docent
does not record revenue on sales to customers whose ability to pay is in doubt at the time of sale. Rather, revenue is recognized from these customers as payment is received.  Revenue arrangements with extended payment terms are generally considered not to be fixed or determinable and, accordingly,
revenue is not recognized on these arrangements until the customer payment becomes due. Docents normal payment terms currently range from net 30 days to net 60 days, which are not considered extended payment terms.
For arrangements involving time-based licenses, customers pay
a fee based on the number of users, and such fees include maintenance and support. Objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the related maintenance and support, as maintenance and support are not offered separately for time-based
arrangements. In these cases, revenue for the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance and support period, which is generally one year. Docent has allocated the time-based license and maintenance revenue based on
their relative costs.  Many of the software contracts include
consulting implementation services. Consulting revenues from these contracts are generally accounted for separately from the license revenues because the consulting arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in SOP 97-2. The
more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services i.e., consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product, degree
of risk, availability of services from other vendors, timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee. Revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are
performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion date or receipt of payment for the consulting services, revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. Docent estimates the percentage of completion
on contracts with fixed or not  
38  DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to
complete the project. If there are no sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion, revenue is recognized when final acceptance from the customer is received. When total cost estimates exceed revenues, Docent accrues for the estimated
losses immediately based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services.  For arrangements involving a significant amount of services related to installation, modification or customization of our software products, revenue is
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. However, where there are customer acceptance clauses that Docent does not have an established history of meeting or which are not considered to be routine, revenue is recognized when the
arrangement has been completed and accepted by the customer.  For perpetual license arrangements that include multiple elements, such as a product license, maintenance and support, hosting and professional services, Docent allocates revenue to all undelivered elements, usually maintenance and support,
hosting and professional services, based on objective evidence of the fair value of those elements. Fair value represents the price for which Docent sells each element separately. Any amount remaining is allocated using the residual method to the
delivered elements, generally only the product license, and recognized as revenue when the conditions discussed above are satisfied.  Docent recognizes revenue from fees for ongoing maintenance and support ratably over the period of the maintenance and support agreement, which is
generally one year. Docent recognizes revenue allocated to, or fees generated from, the separate selling of professional services as the related services are performed. Fees associated with hosting and application service provider ASP
services are recognized ratably over the period of the hosting agreement, which is generally one year.  For arrangements with content providers, the minimum fee is allocated among the separate elements, including professional services and hosting, based on
the fair value of each of these elements. Any minimum royalty amount is recognized as revenue ratably over the period in which it is earned, which is generally one year. Any royalty over and above the minimum is recognized upon receipt of a revenue
report from the content provider.  Customer billings that have
not been recognized as revenue in accordance with the above policies are shown on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. Costs associated with deferred revenue are shown on our balance sheet as other current assets.  Property and equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are
generally calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from 3 to 5 years. Leasehold improvements and assets acquired under capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
term of the lease, or the useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the statement of operations for the period realized.  Goodwill  The Company evaluates the recoverability of its goodwill, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 prescribes a two-phase, if necessary, measure of impairment. The Company performed the required annual impairment test of goodwill as of October 1, 2003. The Company considers itself to be a
single reporting unit. Accordingly, all of the Companys goodwill is associated with the entire company. As of October 1, 2003, based on the estimated fair value of the Company, there was no impairment of goodwill recorded. Fair value is
determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. When determining the discount rate, the Company considered the inherent risks associated with an early stage company that has yet to
reached profitability. The Company will perform an interim impairment analysis if circumstances dictate. Any reduction of the enterprise fair value below the carrying amount of goodwill could require the Company to write down the value and record an
expense for the impairment loss.  Intangible and other long
lived assets  The Company evaluates the recoverability of
its intangible and other long lived assets, in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company performed an impairment test of intangible assets as of October 1, 2003. As of
October 1, 2003, based on the discounted cashflows expected during its remaining useful life, to its carrying value, there was no impairment of intangible assets recorded. The Company will perform an interim impairment analysis if circumstances
dictate. 
39  DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Capitalized Software  Costs related to internally developed software and software purchased for internal use, which are required to be capitalized
pursuant to Statement of Position SOP No. 98-1, Accounting for Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, are included in property, plant and equipment.  Research and development  Costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are
expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is established. Development costs are capitalized beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when the product is available for general release to
customers. Technological feasibility is reached when the product reaches the beta stage. To date, software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant, and all software
development costs have been charged to research and development expenses.  Shipping Costs  The
Companys shipping and handling costs are included under cost of sales for all periods presented.  Advertising  Costs related to advertising and promotion of products is charged to sales and marketing expense as incurred. Advertising expense for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, were $15,000, $4,000 and $324,000, respectively.  Income taxes  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.  Stock-based compensation  Docent accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB
No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation FIN No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans, and complies with the
disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is based on the
difference, if any, on the date of grant, between the estimated fair value of Docents common stock and the exercise price. SFAS 123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity
investment. The pro forma disclosures of the difference between the compensation expense included in net loss and the related cost measured by the fair value method are presented in Note 10. Docent accounts for equity instruments issued to
nonemployees in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods
or Services.  Accumulated other comprehensive income
At December 31, 2002 and 2003, the components of
accumulated other comprehensive income, reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity, net of related taxes, were comprised of the following in thousands:  2003

included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The aggregate exchange gain included in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 was $158,000 and $287,000, respectively. The aggregate exchange gain loss
included in the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2001 was insignificant.  Recently issued accounting pronouncements  In November 2002, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Issue 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or
performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of Issue 00-21 will apply to revenue arrangements entered into after June 30, 2003. The adoption of Issue 00-21 did not have a material effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations.  In January 2003,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46, which was amended by FIN 46R issued in December 2003. This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51, Consolidated Financial Statements, addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities VIEs that either: 1 do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support, or 2 for which the equity investors lack an essential characteristic of a controlling financial interest. This Interpretation applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003. It also
applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004, to VIEs created before February 1, 2003 in which an enterprise holds a variable interest. FIN 46 requires disclosure of VIEs in financial statements issued after January
31, 2003, if it is reasonably possible that as of the transition date: 1 the company will be the primary beneficiary of an existing VIE that will require consolidation or, 2 the company will hold a significant variable interest in, or have
significant involvement with, an existing VIE. We are currently in the process of completing our review of the requirements of FIN 46. However, we have not yet identified any entities that require disclosure or entities that would require
consolidation under FIN 46 that had not previously been consolidated as a result of FIN 46.  3. Investment fair values  The fair values of Docents short-term investments are as follows in thousands:  December 31, 2003 AmortizedCost

Assets  On October 16, 2001, Docent acquired gForce
Systems, Inc. gForce, a leading provider of rapid eLearning content management and delivery solutions. The Company acquired gForce to extend its existing product line. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method
of accounting. Goodwill was subsequently reduced by $140,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2002 to $760,000, due to the settlement of a liability for an amount less than the amount recorded at the time of the acquisition. The following table
summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands:  AtOctober16,2001 Current assets 172 Property, plant, and equipment 211 Research and development assets 707 Intangible assets subject to amortization thirty two month weighted-average useful life Core technology three year useful life 2,493 Developed technology fourteen month useful life 568 Patents three year useful life 148 Trade name fourteen month useful life 83 3,292 Goodwill 900 Total assets acquired 5,282 Current liabilities 3,804 Long-term liabilities 939 Total liabilities assumed 4,743 Net assets acquired 539 
42  DOCENT, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company acquired gForce by assuming liabilities of $4,743,000 and providing an advance payment of
$119,000. The Company also incurred approximately $420,000 of acquisition costs, for a total purchase price of $5,282,000. To settle certain gForce liabilities, the Company issued 166,666 shares of its common stock valued at an aggregate amount of
$1,019,000.  To determine the value of the developed
technology, the expected future cash flow attributed to all existing technology was discounted, taking into account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology, existing and future markets, and assessments of the life
cycle stage of technology, existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of technology. The $707,000 assigned to research and development assets represented acquired in-process research and development IPRD
that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. We wrote off these assets at the date of acquisition in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 2 to Business Combination Accounted for by the Purchase Method. To estimate the value of the IPRD, the expected cash flows attributed to the completed portion of the IPRD were calculated. These cash
flows considered the contribution of the core technology, the risks related to the development of the IPRD and the percent complete as of the valuation date as well as the expected life cycle of the technology. Finally, the cash flows
attributed to the completed portion of the IPRD, net of the core technology contribution, were discounted to the present value to estimate the value of the IPRD. Goodwill is determined based on the residual difference between the amount
paid and the values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill is not being amortized.  The results of operations of gForce from October 16, 2001 to December 31, 2003 were included in Docents Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following unaudited pro forma information represents the
results of operations for Docent and gForce for the years ended December 31, 2001, as if the acquisition had been consummated as of January 1, 2001. This pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of what may occur in the future in

6. Restructuring Charge  In 2001 and 2002, Docent implemented restructuring programs to better align operating expenses with anticipated revenues.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2001, Docent recorded a
$42 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $30 million in facility exit costs, $704,000 in employee severance costs, $224,000 in equipment impairment and $211,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in
force across all company functions of approximately 11%, or 35 employees.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, Docent recorded a $19 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $779,000 in facility exit costs, $833,000 in employee severance costs, $144,000 in equipment impairment
and $188,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 16%, or 45 employees. These facility exist costs include an adjustment of $112,000 related to the
restructuring recorded during the third quarter of fiscal 2001. The adjustment reflects the reduction of the estimated sublease income of a particular vacated facility.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2002, Docent recorded a $925,000 restructuring charge, which consisted of $886,000 in
employee severance costs and $39,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 17%, or 42 employees.  During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, Docent recorded a $31 million restructuring charge, which consisted of $21
million in facility exit costs, $822,000 in employee severance costs, $163,000 in equipment impairment, and $27,000 in other exit costs. The restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 17%, or
36 employees.  Also during the second quarter of fiscal 2002,
Docent increased its estimate of the total costs associated with the above restructuring activities and recorded an adjustment of $298,000. The adjustment reflects the reduction of the estimated sublease income of one vacated facility of $372,000,
partially offset by the settlement of another lease obligation in the amount of $74,000.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, Docent continued the announced second quarter restructuring actions. Docent recorded a $381,000 restructuring charge, which consisted of $271,000 in employee severance costs,
and $110,000 in equipment impairment. The continued restructuring program resulted in a reduction in force across all company functions of approximately 5%, or nine employees.  Also during the third quarter of fiscal 2002, Docent settled a facility lease obligation of a vacated facility, associated
with the above restructuring activities, and recorded an adjustment of $16 million. The adjustment reflects a reduction of the future monthly lease payments that were originally estimated to be $30 million, but were settled for $14 million.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, Docent recorded a
$327,000 provision adjustment. The adjustment included $141,000 of other costs and $85,000 of employee severance, due to the finalization of payments associated with other costs and employee severance at lower amounts than previously estimated.
Docent also recorded an adjustment of $101,000 related to a vacated facility associated with the above restructuring activities that was subleased during the quarter.  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, Docent recorded a $64,000 provision adjustment related to a vacated facility
associated with the above restructuring activities that was subleased during the quarter.  The following table depicts the restructuring activity during 2003 in thousands:  Category

no equipment was acquired under a capital lease in 2003. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, Docent acquired equipment under capital leases with a cost of $26,000 and $283,000, respectively. The accumulated amortization on these
assets was $358,000, and $170,000 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization expenses on these assets are included in depreciation expense for all periods presented.  8.

Purchase commitment  In September 2002, Docent entered into an agreement with a third party software company to resell and distribute that
companys product through April 2005. Under the agreement, Docent committed to distribute $10 million of the third party software companys software and pay the third party software company $10 million over the first year of the
agreement for the distributed software. In September 2003, Docent amended the agreement to extend the commitment until April 2005. As of December 31, 2003, Docents remaining commitment under this agreement was $886,000. If Docent fails to
resell $886,000 of the third party companys software by April 2005, Docent will be obligated to pay the third party software company the remaining unsold balance due.  Contingencies  On May 31, 2002, IP Learn, LLC filed a patent infringement case against Docent in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California. IP Learn alleged 5 patent infringement claims related to online learning against Docent and several other major manufacturers of online learning software. In December 2002, IP Innovation, LLC filed a patent infringement case against
Docent in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. IP Innovation asserted a claim against Docent and seven other defendants regarding a computer graphics patent asserting that the patent covers the use of HTML Hypertext
Markup Language in graphics software used in a computer system. Neither of these patent cases has stated any specific demands for monetary damages. Docent believes that the patent infringement cases are without merit and intends to defend against
them vigorously. However, if these third party claims for infringement and their patents are valid, we may be required to license the patents on terms that may or may not be favorable or be forced to alter our website or our software product which
is the subject of the patents, either of which results may adversely affect our revenue.  Also, from time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the Companys ordinary course of business. The Company believes that there are no claims or actions pending
or threatened against it, disposition of which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  9.

in effect for the next 12-month offering period. A total of 324,305 shares of common were available for purchase under the ESPP as of December 31, 2003. On January 1 of each year, an annual increase in the number of shares available for purchase
under the ESPP shall be calculated and is equal to the lesser of i that number of shares such that the number of shares reserved for purchase under the ESPP excluding all shares previously issued or to be issued under the ESPP is four percent
4% of Docents outstanding common stock as of the closing of the prior fiscal year, or ii a lesser amount determined by Docents Board of Directors. During the year 2003 and 2002, 71,499 and 77,219 shares, respectively, were purchased

pricing model based on the assumptions set forth in the following table:  Option Employee Stock Purchase Plan Year Ended December 31 Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 2001 2003 2002 2001 Dividend yield 0 0 0 0 0 0 Volatility 95 95 95 72 95 95 Risk free interest rate 121426 121426 49 102185 120185 49 Expected lives of options 4years 4years 4years 6months 6months 6months Weighted average fair value 183 348 855 098 053 639
These pro forma
amounts may not be representative of the effects on reported net loss for future years as options vest over several years and additional awards are generally made each year.  Stock-based compensation  In connection with certain stock option grants to employees during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, Docent recognized approximately $27,355,000
and $8,466,000 of unearned stock-based compensation for the excess of the deemed fair value of the shares of common stock subject to such options over the exercise price of these options at the date of grant. Such amounts are included as a reduction
of stockholders equity and are being amortized using the accelerated amortization method over the vesting period of generally four years. The accelerated amortization method records more expense early in the life of the options. Docent
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $872,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003 and $11,187,000, for the years ended December 31, 2001. The 2002 termination of certain Docent officers with unvested options that had already been expensed
under the accelerated method created an overall stock-based compensation credit of $193,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002.  In February 2003, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors elected to amend the existing stock option grants for Section 16 officers, and
future grants to Section 16 officers, to provide for an extended exercise period for vested stock options upon the regular termination of service from Docent changing it from 90 days to twelve months. Included in stock-based compensation expense for
the year ended December 31, 2003 is $153,000 associated with this amendment.  Stock-based compensation expense related to equity instruments granted to consultants is recognized as earned. At each reporting date, Docent re-values any unvested equity investments using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. As a result, the stock-based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair market value of Docents common stock fluctuates.  Docent did not grant any options to purchase common stock to consultants in 2003. Docent granted options to purchase 18,000 and 2,500 shares of its common
stock to consultants during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, Docent recorded $36,000 amortized stock based compensation associated with the 2002 option grants. In 2002, Docent recorded $14,000 amortized stock based
compensation associated with the 2002 option grants. In 2001, Docent recorded compensation expense of $44,000 associated with the 2001 options. Docent did not issue any common stock to consultants in 2003, 2002 and 2001.  Docent terminated the employment of certain officers during 2002 and 2001. In
connection with the terminations, Docent accelerated the vesting on certain stock options held by the employees and recorded a compensation charge of $14,000 and $198,000 related to the re-measurement of these options at the date of termination for
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, Docent had federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately
$134 million and $41 million respectively, available to offset future taxable income. Docents federal and state net operating loss carry-forwards will expire in the years 2004 through 2023, if not utilized.  At December 31, 2003, Docent also had research and development credit
carry-forwards for both federal and state of approximately $15 million. The federal carry-forwards will expire in the years 2018 through 2023, if not fully utilized.  The Company incurred pre-tax income from foreign operations of $590,000 for the year ended December 3l, 2003, and $23
million for the year ended December 3l, 2002. Pretax losses from foreign operations were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2001.  Utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities, for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of Docents deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows in thousands:  December 31 2003 2002 Net operating losses 48,078 45,611 Tax credit carry-forwards 2,698 1,877 Capitalized research and development 1,272 143 Deferred Revenue 580 Other 2,334 1,655 54,962 49,286 Less valuation allowance 54,962 49,286 Net deferred tax assets    Realization of the
deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. Accordingly, a valuation allowance, in an amount equal to the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2003 has been established to reflect these
uncertainties. The valuation allowance increased by $5,676,000, $8,040,000, and $16,688,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 
Approximately $284,000 of the valuation allowance is attributable to stock options, the benefit of which will be credited to paid-in capital when
realized.  13. Net loss per share  Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss
for the period by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less outstanding unvested shares. The calculation of diluted net loss per share excludes potential common shares as the effect is antidilutive,
due to Docent net loss in each period. Potential common shares are comprised of common stock subject to repurchase rights, incremental shares of common and preferred stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options or warrants and shares issuable
upon conversion of convertible preferred stock.

In March 2000, Docent entered into an alliance agreement with Accenture,
which at the time was a stockholder of Docent and one of whose retired partners was a member of Docents Board of Directors until June 6, 2003. The alliance agreement provides for the resale of Docents software products and services by
Accenture, the submission of joint proposals to potential clients where either Docent would be subcontracting Docents services to Accenture or Accenture would be subcontracting its services to Docent; the alliance agreement also provides for
revenue sharing. The agreement terminates by its terms on March 31, 2005, with either party having the right to terminate the agreement before then without cause on 60 days notice.  From March 2000 to December 2002, Accentures holdings in Docents common stock on a fully diluted basis
represented approximately 50% to 70% of the outstanding shares of Docents common stock. In December 2002, Docent believes that Accenture sold all of its Docent common stock and warrants.  In 2002, Docent recognized $324,000 of revenue from Accenture as part of this
resale arrangement. In 2001, Docent recognized $864,000 of revenue from Accenture as part of this resale arrangement. During 2002, Docent recorded $321,000 as a reduction in revenues for amounts due to Accenture under the revenue sharing agreement
with Accenture. During 2001, Docent recorded $858,000 as a reduction in revenues for amounts due to Accenture under the revenue sharing agreement with Accenture.  Concurrent with the alliance agreement, Docent entered into a consulting services agreement with Accenture pursuant to which
Docent committed to purchase $20 million of consulting services from Accenture prior to April 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, Docent had only purchased $14 million of consulting services from Accenture. Docent did not record a liability
associated with the remaining purchase commitment for this agreement as of December 31, 2003. If Accenture requests the remaining payments, Docent would use the additional services from Accenture and expense those services as they are provided.
In August 2002, Docent signed
a one year consulting agreement with Mr. Robert Lauer, a former Board member of Docent. The agreement was for one year and compensated Mr. Lauer $46,000 in 2003, and $27,000 in 2002. The agreement also granted Mr. Lauer 13,000 stock options that
vest over one year with an exercise price of $280 per share. Docent recorded stock-based compensation expense of $21,000 related to these stock options in 2003, and $14,000 in 2002. Docent valued the vested portion of these options using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Mr. Lauer was consulting Docents management regarding strategic planning and business development.

Docent also entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers of Docent, as
described above in Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.  15. Warranties and Indemnification  Docent generally provides to its customers a warranty for its software products and services for a period of 90 days, and accounts for its warranties
under the FASBs Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. Docents software products media are generally warranted to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal
use and the products are also generally warranted to substantially perform as described in certain Company documentation. Docents services are generally warranted to be performed in a professional manner and to materially conform to the
specifications set forth in a customers signed contract. In the event there is a failure of such warranties, Docent generally will correct or provide a reasonable work around or replacement product. Docent has not provided for a warranty
accrual in any period presented. To date, Docents product warranty expense has not been significant.  Docent generally agrees to indemnify its customers against legal claims that Docents software products and professional services infringe certain
third-party intellectual property rights and accounts for its indemnification obligations under FAS 5. In the event of such a claim, Docent is generally obligated to defend its customer against the claim and to either settle the claim at
Docents expense or pay damages that the customer is legally required to pay to the third-party claimant. In addition, in the event of an infringement, Docent generally agrees to modify or replace the infringing product, or, if those options
are not reasonably possible, in general, to refund the cost of the software paid to date upon the customers return of the software product. To date, Docent has not been required to make any payment resulting from infringement claims asserted against
its customers. As such, Docent has not recorded a liability for infringement costs in any period presented.  16. Employee Benefit Plan  Docent adopted a 401k Profit Sharing Plan and Trust the 401k Plan effective October 16, 1997, which is intended to qualify under Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401k Plan allows eligible employees to
contribute up to 25% of their pre-tax salary, subject to a maximum limit of $12,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, subject to certain limitations. The 401k Plan provides for employer contributions at the discretion of the Board of Directors. No amounts have been contributed by Docent to the 401k Plan through December 31, 2003.  17. Merger With Click2learn  On October 20, 2003, Docent entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization with Click2learn, Inc. Click2learn. Under terms of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, which has been approved by the board of directors of each company, Click2learn and Docent will each be acquired by a new
corporate entity. Stockholders of Click2learn will receive 3188 shares of common stock in the new company for each common share of Click2learn held on the closing date, or approximately 52% of the total outstanding common stock of the new company,
without taking into account the exercise of options prior to the closing date. Stockholders of Docent will receive 7327 shares of common stock in the new company for each common share of Docent held on the closing date, or approximately 48% of the total outstanding common stock of the new company, without taking into account the exercise of options prior to the closing
date. Outstanding options and warrants will be converted into options and warrants for the purchase of shares in the new corporation in accordance with the same exchange ratios. The transaction is anticipated to be a tax-free reorganization and/or a
tax-free exchange for United States tax purposes. There will be separate shareholder meetings of both companies on March 18, 2004 to vote on the proposed merger. If the merger were not to be completed, Docent could be required to pay Click2learn a
$25 million termination fee if the merger agreement were terminated under certain specified conditions. Also, Docent would remain liable for its costs related to the transaction, such as legal and accounting fees and a portion of the investment
banking fees.
