31   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders   PCTEL, Inc.   We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing under Item9A that PCTEL,
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company aDelaware
Corporation maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinions.   A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   In our opinion, managements assessment that PCTEL, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on COSO. Also in our opinion, PCTEL, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
COSO.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
balance sheet of PCTEL, Inc. as of December31, 2006 and
the related statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows for the year then ended and our report dated
March16, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph
regarding the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No123R,
Share-Based Payment, in 2006.   /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP   Chicago, Illinois   March16, 2007   
32   REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM   To the Board of Directors and Stockholders   PCTEL, Inc.   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of
PCTEL, Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit.   We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of PCTEL, Inc. as of December31, 2006 and the
results of its operations, its changes in stockholders
equity and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.   As discussed in Notes1 and 11 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective January1, 2006, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
Number 123 revised 2004, Shared-Based Payment.   We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated March16, 2007
expressed an unqualified opinion on managements assessment
and the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting.   /s/GRANT

opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the

their cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended

generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the

We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with

audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   Nature
of Operations   PCTEL was incorporated in California in 1994 and reincorporated
in Delaware in 1998. PCTEL provides wireless connectivity
products and technology to wireless carriers, aggregators of
Internet connectivity, wireless Internet service providers
WISPs, PC OEMs, and wireless equipment
manufacturers. The company brings together expertise in RF
platform design, mobility software, and hardware. Additionally,
the company licenses both patented and proprietary access
technology, principally related to analog modems, to modem
solution providers.   The company principally operates in three business segments.   Broadband
Technology Group   The Broadband Technology Group BTG designs, distributes, and
supports innovative antenna solutions for public safety
applications, unlicensed and licensed wireless broadband, fleet
management, network timing, and other GPS applications. The
BTGs portfolio of OEM receivers and interference
management solutions are used to measure, monitor and optimize
cellular networks.   The companys antenna products originated through a series
of acquisitions starting with MAXRAD, Inc, which was acquired in
January 2004. MAXRADs antenna solutions consist of
antennas designed to enhance the performance of broadband
wireless, in-building wireless, wireless Internet service
providers and Land Mobile Radio LMR applications. As a result
of the October 2004 acquisition of certain antenna product lines
from Andrew Corporation Andrew, the product
portfolio expanded to include GPS Global Positioning Systems,
satellite communications Mobile SATCOM and on-glass mobile
antennas. In July 2005, the company again expanded the product
portfolio with the purchase of Sigma Wireless Technologies
Limited Sigma or SWT, located in
Dublin, Ireland. Sigma provides integrated variable electrical
tilt base stations antennas iVET, Public Mobile Radio PMR,
and Digital Public Mobile Radio DPMR antenna products.   BTGs OEM receiver and interference management solutions
consist of software-defined radio products designed to measure
and monitor cellular networks. The products originated through
the business of DTI, Inc., which was acquired in March 2003. The
technology is sold in two forms; as OEM radio frequency
receivers or as integrated systems solutions.   Mobility
Solutions Group   The Mobility Solutions Group MSG produces mobility software
products for WiFi, cellular, IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS, and
wired applications.   Licensing   PCTEL has an intellectual property portfolio consisting of over
130 U.S.patents and applications, primarily in analog
modem technology. It also has proprietary DSP based embedded
modem technology. The company has had an active licensing
program since 2002 designed to monetize the value of its modem
related intellectual property.   Basis
of Consolidation   These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
the company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued
For the
Year Ended: December31, 2006   Use of
Estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods
reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   Reclassifications   Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current years presentation.   Foreign
Currency Translation   The functional currency for the companys foreign
operations is predominantly the applicable local currency.
Accounts of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.dollars using the year-end exchange rate for assets
and liabilities and average monthly rates for revenue and
expense accounts. Adjustments resulting from translation are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a
separate component of shareholders equity. Gains and
losses resulting from other transactions originally in foreign
currencies and then translated into U.S.dollars are
included in net income. Net foreign exchange gains resulting
from foreign currency transactions included in other expense
income, net were $114,000 for the year ended December31,
2006. Net foreign exchange losses resulting from foreign
currency transactions included in other expense income, net
were $557,000 and $22,000 for the years ended December31,
2005 and 2004, respectively.   Cash
Equivalents and Short-Term Investments   The companys cash equivalents and short-term investments
are invested in highly liquid, low risk money markets,
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, and municipal bonds.
The cash equivalents include investments with original
maturities less than 90days. The short-term investments
include investments with original maturities greater than
90days. All short-term investments are treated as held to
maturity and are valued at amortized cost. At December31,
2006, none of the short-term investments had a remaining
maturity greater than 90days. At December31, 2006
and 2005, the company had $21million of cash equivalents
in foreign bank accounts.   At December31, 2005, the company had certificates of
deposit that supported a stand-by letter of credit in connection
with the lease obligation for the Chicago office. This amount
was reported as restricted cash on the balance sheet for the
year ended December31, 2005. Under terms of an amended
lease agreement signed in October 2006, the company paid a cash
deposit and the letter of credit was returned to us.

70,771     58,966   Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts   The company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
estimated uncollectible accounts receivable. The allowance is
based on the companys assessment of known delinquent
accounts, historical experience, and other currently available
evidence of the collectability and the aging of accounts
receivable. The companys total allowance for doubtful
accounts was $03million at December31, 2006 and
December31, 2005, respectively. The provision for doubtful
accounts is included in sales and marketing expense.   Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and
include material, labor and overhead costs using the FIFO method
of costing. Inventories as of December31, 2006 were
composed of raw materials, sub assemblies, finished goods and
work-in-process.
The company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and,
based on the current estimated requirements, it was determined
that any excess inventory was reserved as of December31,
2006 and 2005. Due to competitive pressures and technological
innovation, there may be excess inventory in the future. As of
December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, the allowance
for inventory losses was $09million. Write-downs of
inventories would have a negative impact on gross margin.   Inventories consist of the following in thousands

Recognition   The company sells antenna products, software defined radio
products, and licenses the modem technology through the
licensing program. The company records the sale of these
products, including related maintenance, and the licensing of
the intellectual property as revenue.   In accordance with SABNo104, the company recognizes
revenue when the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered, price is fixed and determinable, and
collectibility is reasonably assured. The company recognizes
revenue for sales of the antenna products and software defined
radio products, when title transfers, which is predominantly
upon shipment from the factory. Revenue is recognized for
antenna products sold to major distributors upon shipment from
the factory. The company allows its major antenna product
distributors to return product under specified terms and
conditions. The company accrues for product returns in
accordance with FAS48, Revenue Recognition When
Right of Return Exists.   The company recognizes revenue from the Wi-Fi and cellular
mobility software, including related maintenance rights, under
SOP97-2
Software Revenue Recognition as amended by
SOP-98
Modification of
SOP-72,
Software Recognition with Respect to Certain Transactions.
If the software license is perpetual and vendor specific
objective evidence can be established for the software license
and any related maintenance rights, the software license revenue
is recognized upon delivery of the software and the maintenance
is recorded pro-rata over the life of the maintenance rights. If
part of the licensing agreement requires engineering services to
customize software for the customer needs, the revenue for these
services is recognized upon completion of engineering
documentation. If vendor specific objective evidence cannot be
established, and the only undelivered item is maintenance, the

For the

engineering services, if applicable, and the related maintenance
rights are combined and recognized pro-rata over the expected
term of the maintenance rights. If vendor specific evidence
cannot be established on any of the non-maintenance elements,
the revenue is recorded pro-rata over the life of the
contractual obligation. At December31, 2006, the company
had unbilled revenue of approximately $08million for
mobility software products. At December31, 2005, the
company had unbilled revenue of approximately $03million.   The company records intellectual property licensing revenue when
it has a licensing agreement, the amount of related royalties is
known for the accounting period reported, and collectibility is
reasonably assured. Knowledge of the royalty amount specific to
an accounting period is either in the form of a royalty report
specific to a quarter, a contractual fixed payment in the
license agreement specific to a quarter, or the pro-rata
amortization of a fixed payment related to multiple quarters
over those quarters using the operating lease method. If a
license agreement provides for a fixed payment related to
periods prior to the license effective date the past and
volume-based royalties going forward, the fixed payment is
recognized at the license effective date and the volume based
royalties are recognized as royalty reports are received. If the
license provides for a fixed payment for the past and for a
finite future period, to be followed by volume based royalties
thereafter, the fixed payment is recorded under the operating
lease method and recognized pro-rata from the effective date
through the end of the period covered by the fixed payment. If a
one-time license payment is made for a perpetual license, with
no future obligations on behalf of us, revenue is recognized
under the capitalized lease method upon the effective date.   There is one exception to the recognition of intellectual
property licensing as revenue. The company signed a licensing
agreement with Conexant simultaneously with the sale of its HSP
modem product line to Conexant in 2003. Because the HSP modem
product line also requires a license to the companys
patent portfolio, the gain on sale of the product line and the
licensing stream are not separable for accounting purposes.
Ongoing royalties from Conexant are presented in the income
statement as Gain on Sale of Assets and Related Royalties.   Research
Development and Software Development Costs   The company expenses research and development costs as incurred.
All costs incurred prior to establishing the technological
feasibility of computer software products to be sold are
research and development costs and expensed as incurred in
accordance with SFAS86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed. To date, the company has expensed all software
development costs because costs incurred subsequent to the
products reaching technological feasibility were not significant.   Advertising
Costs   Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are
incurred. Advertising expense was $02million in fiscal
years 2006 and 2005, and $03million in fiscal 2004.   Income
Taxes   The company provides for income taxes under the provisions of
SFASNo109, Accounting for Income Taxes.
SFASNo109 requires an asset and liability based
approach in accounting for income taxes. Deferred income tax
assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates. Valuation allowances are
provided against deferred tax assets, which are not likely to be
realized. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the
recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a
valuation allowance.

For the
Year Ended: December31, 2006   Stock-Based
Compensation   In the first fiscal quarter of 2006, the company adopted
SFASNo123R, Share Based Payments,
which revises SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation. SFASNo123R requires the
company to record compensation expense for share-based payments,
including employee stock options, at fair value. Prior to fiscal
2006, the company had accounted for its stock-based compensation
awards pursuant to Accounting Principles Opinion APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related interpretations, which allowed
use of the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value
method, compensation expense for stock option based employee
compensation was not recognized in the income statement as all
stock options granted by the company had an exercise price equal
to the market value of the underlying common stock on the option
grant date.   The company elected to use the modified prospective transition
method to adopt SFASNo123R. Under this transition
method, compensation expense includes expense for all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and the expense for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006 based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123R. As required under the
modified prospective transition method the company has not
restated prior period results. As a result, certain components
of the companys quarterly financial statements will not be
comparable until the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the
anniversary of the companys adoption of
SFASNo123R. As part of the adoption of
SFASNo123R, the company used the alternative
transition method in SFAS 123R to establish the beginning
balance of the additional paid in capital APIC pool related to
employee compensation. The company determined that it is in a
net shortfall position and thus, started at $0 for the APIC pool
in the quarter ended March31, 2006.   In the quarter ended March31, 2005, the company
accelerated the vesting of all unvested options to purchase
shares of common stock of PCTEL that were held by current
employees, including executive officers, and which have an
exercise price per share equal to or greater than $1000. The
weighted average price of the shares accelerated was $1124. The
effect of this acceleration resulted in PCTEL not being required
to recognize share-based compensation expense of
$38million in the periods after adoption of
SFASNo123R.   The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net
income and earnings per share if the company had applied the

For the
Year Ended: December31, 2006   Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets   The company reports operating results for three segments:
Broadband Technology, Mobility Solutions, and Licensing. For
evaluation purposes, we test each operating segment for possible
goodwill and other intangible assets impairment annually, by
comparing each segments net book value to fair value in
accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets. The process of evaluating the potential
impairment of goodwill is subjective. To estimate the fair value
of the operating segments, we made estimates and judgments about
the future cash flows of our operating segments. The assumptions
used in our cash flow forecasts are consistent with plans and
estimates we use to manage the underlying operating segments.
The companys assumptions require significant judgment and
actual cash flows may differ from those forecasted. A
third-party valuation firm provided the weighted average cost of
capital WACC used for the companys evaluation.   Intangible assets consist principally of technology, non-compete
agreements, patents, trademarks and tradenames, and customer
relationships and are amortized over a period of one to eight
years.   Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   Cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments are
recognized and measured at fair value in the companys
financial statements. Accounts receivable and other investments
are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair
value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term
debt are financial liabilities with carrying values that
approximate fair value.   Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No108,
Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Current Year Misstatements.
SABNo108 requires analysis of misstatements using
both an income statement rollover approach and a balance sheet
iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides
for a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment.
SABNo108 is effective for the companys fiscal
year 2006 annual financial statements. Currently, the company
prepares an analysis for all misstatements using the dual
approach. The dual approach incorporates both the income
statement and balance sheet for measuring materiality. There is
no impact to adoption of this pronouncement at December 31, 2006.   In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No157, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFASNo157 does not require any new fair value
measurements, but provides guidance on how to measure fair value
by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source
of the information. SFAS157 is effective for financial
statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November15, 2007. We will adopt SFAS157 on its
effective date. The company is in the process of determining any
potential impact that the adoption of SFASNo157
will have on our financial statements.   In July 2006, FASB released FASB Interpretation No48,
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No109
FIN48. FIN48 clarifies the accounting and
reporting for uncertainties in income tax positions. FIN48
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
FIN48 also provides guidance on derecognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
periods, disclosure and transition. FIN48 is effective for
fiscal years ending after December15, 2006. We will adopt
FIN48 as of January1, 2007, as required. The
cumulative effects, if any, of applying this Interpretation will
be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the period of adoption. The company is currently

determination of the impact of adoption on the companys
results of operations or financial position.   In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections , a replacement of APB Opinion No20 and
FASB Statement No3. This statement applies to all
voluntary changes in accounting principle, and requires
retrospective application to prior periods financial
statements for changes in accounting principle.
SFASNo154 will be effective for the company
beginning in fiscal year 2007. The company does not believe this
statement will have a material impact on the companys
financial statements.   Effective January1, 2006, the company adopted
SFASNo123R, Share Based Payments, as
described in Note11, Stock-Based Compensation, in the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Earnings
Per Share   The company computes earnings per share in accordance with
SFASNo128, Earnings Per Share.
SFASNo128 requires companies to compute net income
per share under two different methods, basic and diluted, and
present per share data for all periods in which statements of
operations are presented. Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income/net loss by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding, less shares subject to
repurchase. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing
net income by the weighted average number of common stock and
common stock equivalents outstanding. Common stock equivalents
consist of stock options using the treasury stock method. Common
stock options are excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive. The
weighted average common stock option grants excluded from the
calculations of diluted net loss per share for the year ended
December31, 2006 were 701,591. The weighted average common
stock option grants and restricted shares excluded from the
calculations of diluted net loss per share for the years ended
December31, 2005 and December31, 2004 were 554,699

Wireless Technologies   In July 2005, the company purchased all of the outstanding
shares of Sigma Wireless Technology Limited Sigma,
a developer, manufacturer and distributor of antenna products
designed for public safety and for the UMTS cellular networks.
With the acquisition of Sigma, the company gained entry into the
growing cellular base station antenna market and also gained a
geographic footprint in Europe.   The company paid cash consideration of 194million Euro
approximately $231million, plus assumed an unfunded
pension obligation of approximately 25million Euro
approximately $30million, and incurred approximately
17million Euro approximately $20million in
transaction costs.   The total purchase price of 236million Euro
approximately $282million was allocated
$82million to tangible assets acquired, $78million
to liabilities assumed, $25million to core technology,
$64million to customer relationships, and
$01million to order backlog in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The intangible assets have a
weighted average amortization period of six years. The

the goodwill and intangible assets for technology and customer
relationships, as required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No144 Accounting for the Impairment or
the Disposal of Long Lived Assets and Statement of
Accounting Standards No142 Goodwill and Intangible
Assets. Based on revised projections for future revenues,
profits, and cash flows for the products associated with the
Sigma acquisition, the company concluded that the carrying value
of intangible assets was impaired by $60million and the
carrying value of the goodwill was impaired by
$143million. The total impairment cost was recorded in
the third quarter of 2006. The method of determining the
impairment was the same methodology as used for our annual
impairment test.   Goodwill   The company conducted the annual impairment test of goodwill as
of October31, 2006. For this evaluation, each operating
segments fair value was greater than its net book value

operating segments, we made estimates and judgments about the
future cash flows of our operating segments. The assumptions
used in our cash flow forecasts are consistent with plans and
estimates we use to manage the underlying operating segments.
The companys assumptions require significant judgment and
actual cash flows may differ from those forecasted.   The summary of goodwill as of December31 for the years

Restructuring   Dublin
restructuring   The 2006 restructuring expense relates to the companys
Dublin, Ireland restructuring activity. On April7, 2006,
the company reached an agreement in principle with the labor
union responsible for the companys manufacturing and
certain other personnel in its Dublin, Ireland factory to
discontinue the manufacture of the iVET, PMR and DPMR lines of
the companys antenna products at that location. The
agreement was formally signed on April20, 2006. This
agreement enabled the company to wind down its manufacturing
operations at the Dublin facility, terminate 65 redundant
employee positions, downsize its space under the current lease
at this location, and reduce its pension obligations to
terminated and remaining employees. Manufacturing of the lines
of antenna products was relocated either to a contract
manufacturer in St. Petersburg, Russia, or to the companys
BTG facility in Bloomingdale, Illinois. The process of winding
down manufacturing operations in Dublin and relocating the
products to their new manufacturing locations was completed in
September 2006. The general and administrative support functions
were eliminated in December 2006.   The company continues to maintain antenna research and
development, as well as sales and marketing activities in a
smaller space within the existing facility in Dublin. The
company believes that its restructuring activities will enable
it to improve the gross profit margins of the antenna product
lines that were included with the companys acquisition of
Sigma Wireless Technologies in July 2005.   The company incurred restructuring costs related to the
discontinuation of its Dublin manufacturing operations. The
categories of costs are: severance pay for employees whose jobs
were made redundant, future minimum lease payments through June
2007 on the existing Dublin facility which will be vacated, and,
termination of the employee pension defined benefit plan. The
severance, future lease payments, and a portion of the
termination of the employee pension defined benefit plan result
in cash expenditures. The company also incurred restructuring
costs related to the impairment of fixed assets and inventory.   For the year ended December31, 2006, the company recorded
restructuring expense of $04million, which included the
net benefit related to the termination of the pension plan of
$26million, offsetting employee severance of
$15million, inventory write-offs of $08million,
fixed asset write-offs of $06million, and facility lease
costs of $01million.

For the
Year Ended: December31, 2006   The company negotiated the terms of the pension termination with
the Sigma labor union in June 2006. Under the terms of the
settlement, the company funded the cash shortfall in the
companys PCTEL Europe Pension Plan as calculated by a
third party actuary less any severance amounts given to
employees that exceeded 3weeks severance for every year of
service. The funding shortfall was based on pension requirements
in accordance with Irish regulations. The company funded pension
obligations of $06million and recorded a net gain of
$26million on the termination.   During the year ended December31, 2006, the company paid
employee severance of approximately $24million. Total net
severance costs of approximately $15million are comprised
of a gross cost of $24million less a government rebate of
$09million.   The write-offs for inventory related to disposals of inventory
that was not compatible with the new manufacturing model. The
fixed asset write-offs related to assets identified that are no
longer required at the Dublin facility. The company downsized
the facility at the end of the third quarter of 2006. The
restructuring expense for lease termination costs relates to the
future lease payments for the facility space no longer required.   The following table summarizes the companys restructuring

For the
Year Ended: December31, 2006   The current federal expense for 2006 includes the release of a
$52million tax contingency reserve related to the
companys modem operations and utilization of
$13million in federal research credits. The company also
utilized its remaining carryforwards for federal net operating
losses in 2006.   Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. The net deferred tax accounts
consist of the following in thousands

1,067     805     Net Deferred Tax
Liability     963        805     At December31, 2006, the company had a valuation allowance
of $189million against $190million of deferred tax
assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of
these assets. The companys net deferred tax assets were
$01million at December31, 2006 compared to $0 at
December31, 2005. On a periodic basis, management
evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need
for a valuation allowance. At such time as it is determined that
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are
realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced. The
increase in deferred tax assets in 2006 is due to amortization
of intangible assets for tax purposes, net of federal net
operating losses and research credits.   The effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate
of 35% during 2006 principally due to the release of the tax
contingency reserve of $52million and due to the increase
in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. In addition,
different rates for foreign income and losses and other
permanent items impacted the effective tax rate. The effective
tax rate differed from the statutory federal rate of 35% during
2005 principally due to an increase in the valuation allowance
for deferred tax assets, different rates for foreign income and
losses, and revisions to certain estimates made by management to
other deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter 2005, the
company changed its estimate regarding the taxation of certain
leasing income received in 2004. As a result, the company
reversed the tax expense it booked in 2004 to reflect the change
in estimate regarding its filing position. In 2005 the increase
in the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily resulted from
an increase in deferred tax assets related to net operating
losses. The effective tax rate differed from the statutory
federal rate of 35% during 2004 principally due to permanent
differences including adjustments to the deferred tax valuation
allowance.   The company believes that approximately $09million of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are reinvested
indefinitely, and no federal income tax should be provided under
the plan of investment. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
the Act was passed into law on October22,
2004 and introduced a special one-time dividend received
deduction under certain circumstances on the repatriation of
certain foreign earnings to a United

advantage of this tax credit.   The company has state net operating loss carryforwards of
$23million that expire between 2011 and 2016 and foreign
net operating loss carryforwards of $04million that have
no expiration date. Utilization of the historic net operating
losses of PCTEL Limited have been severely limited due to the
Dublin restructuring activities and accordingly, the company did
not reflect a net deferred tax asset related to those net
operating losses. As such, the company does not consider there
to be any future tax benefits for net operating losses in
Ireland. The company has $17million of federal research
credits that expire between 2020 and 2025 and $16million
of state research credits with no expiration.

facility in Germantown, Maryland for the scanner and receiver
product lines. In February 2006 the company vacated its previous
Germantown, Maryland facility. The lease term for the previous
facility ends in July 2007. The company recorded lease exit
costs in 2006 for the previous Germantown facility.   In September 2006, the company renegotiated its Dublin, Ireland
facility lease. Because of the relocation of Dublin
manufacturing, the company reduced its leased space and
established a new termination date of July 2007. The company is
currently considering leased space in a new facility for its
Dublin engineering operations.   In October 2006, the company amended the Chicago, Illinois lease
whereby the term was extended to 2012 and the square footage was
increased.   The company does not have any capital leases.   Warranty
Reserve and Sales Returns   The companys BTG segment allows its major distributors and
certain other customers to return unused product under specified

that Lucent has infringed three of the companys patents.
Agere counterclaimed asking for a declaratory judgment that the
claims of the four patents are invalid, unenforceable and not
infringed by Agere.   On July26, 2006, the parties entered into a settlement

The company recorded stock-based compensation expense of
$02million for the 2005 CEO Stretch Bonus Plan for the
year ended December31, 2005.   Stock
Options   In the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2006, the company adopted
SFASNo123R, Share Based Payments,
which revises SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation. SFASNo123R requires the
company to record compensation expense for share-based payments,
including employee stock options, at fair value. Prior to fiscal
2006, the company had accounted for its stock based compensation
awards pursuant to Accounting Principles Opinion APB
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and its related interpretations, which allowed
use of the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value
method, compensation expense for stock option based employee
compensation was not recognized in the income statement as all
stock options granted by the company had an exercise price equal
to the market value of the underlying common stock on the option
grant date. With the adoption of SFAS123R, the company
is recognizing compensation expense for stock options on a
graded vesting basis.   The company elected to use the modified prospective transition
method to adopt SFASNo123R. Under this transition
method, compensation expense includes expense for all
share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
SFASNo123, and the expense for all share-based
payments granted subsequent to January1, 2006 based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
provisions of SFASNo123R. As required under the
modified prospective transition method the company has not
restated prior period results. As a result, certain components
of the companys quarterly financial statements will not be
comparable until the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the
anniversary of the companys adoption of
SFASNo123R.   Total stock compensation expense for stock options was
$12million, net of forfeitures for the year ended
December31, 2006. As of December31, 2006, the
unrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested
portion of the companys stock options was approximately
$16million, net of estimated forfeitures to be recognized
through 2010 over a weighted average period of 15years.   The fair value of each unvested option was estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no
vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition,
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including the expected stock price volatility and
expected option life. Because the companys employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those
of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate the

measure of the fair value of the employee stock options. Based
on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted average
estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was $300
for 2006, $303 for 2005, and $363 for 2004.   ESPP   Based on the 15% discount and the fair value of the option
feature of this plan, this plan is considered compensatory under
SFAS123R. Compensation expense is calculated using the
fair value of the employees purchase rights under the
Black-Scholes model. The company recognized compensation expense
of $02million for the year ended December31, 2006.   The company calculated the fair value of each option grant and
employee stock purchase grant on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model as prescribed by
SFAS123 using the following assumptions

yields with remaining term that approximates the expected life
of the options granted. The company used an expected dividend
yield of 0% for all periods because the company has never paid
and does not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable
future. The company calculates the volatility based on a
historical period starting with January 2001. Prior to fiscal
2006, the company used the actual forfeiture method allowed
under SFASNo123, which assumed that all options
vest and pro forma expense was adjusted when options were
forfeited. In 2006, the company incorporated a forfeiture rate
based on historical data in the expense calculation. The
expected life used for options granted in 2006 is based on
historical data of employee exercise performance. Prior to
fiscal 2006, the expected life was based on the average life of
outstanding options.   Total non-cash compensation is reflected in the statements of

Health Insurance   Effective July 2003, the company started a plan to cover
post-retirement health insurance for Martin H. Singer, Chairman
of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Based on an actuarial
valuation prepared by RSM McGladrey in accordance with
FAS106, the companys accumulated post retirement
benefit obligation for this plan was $141,000 at
December31, 2005. On January6, 2006, upon
authorization of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, the company and Martin H. Singer, entered into an
amended and restated employment agreement which eliminated the
post-retirement healthcare benefits for Mr.Singer and his
family that were previously included in his original employment
agreement. Mr.Singer requested the elimination of these
benefits for reasons related to future corporate expense, the
companys commitment to defined contribution plans rather
than defined benefit plans, and parity of benefits with other
executives of the company. The company reversed the liability of
$141,000 in the quarter ended March31, 2006.   Personal
Retirement Savings Account   The Personal Retirement Savings Account PRSA covers all
current Sigma employees. Under this plan, there is no limit for
employee contributions to the PRSA plan. The company may make
discretionary contributions to this plan. The company made
contributions of $27,000 for the year ended December31,
2006 and $7,000 for the six months ended December31, 2005.   Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan   The company provides an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for
executive officers and senior managers. Under this plan, the
companys executives may defer up to 50% of salary and 100%
of cash bonuses with a minimum of $1,500. In addition, the
company provides a 4% matching cash contribution which vests
over three years subject to the executives continued
service. The executive has a choice of investment alternatives
from a menu of mutual funds. The plan is administered by the
Compensation Committee and an outside party tracks investments
and provides our executives with quarterly statements showing
relevant contribution and investment data. Upon termination of
employment, death, disability or retirement, the executive will
receive the value of his account in accordance with the
provisions of the plan. Upon retirement, the executive may
request to receive either a lump sum payment, or payments in
annual installments over 15years or over the lifetime of
the participant with 20 annual payments guaranteed. At the
December31, 2006, the deferred compensation obligation of
$09million was included in Other Long-Term Accrued

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan with corporate-owned life
insurance policies. The cash surrender value of such policies is
included in Other Assets.   Pension

and the projected benefit obligation related to the Sigma
participants in the old plan. At December31, 2005, the

a
Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
Form10-K.
Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
we are required to disclose in our reports that we file or
submit under Securities Exchange Act of 1934 iis
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules
and forms, and iiis accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management.   Our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our
internal control over financial reporting. Managements
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable
assurance because a control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance that the control systems objectives will be met.   
b
Managements
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   Management of PCTEL is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
as defined in
Rules13a-15f
and
15d-15f
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. PCTELs internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that   
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of PCTEL   
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of
PCTEL are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of PCTEL; and   
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
PCTELs assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.   The management of PCTEL has assessed the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006. In making its assessment of internal
control over financial reporting, management used the criteria
described in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.   Based on our assessment of internal controls over financial
reporting, management has concluded that, as of
December31, 2006, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.   Managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2006 has been audited by Grant Thornton, LLC,
an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which appears herein.

c
Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of
control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. During
2006, the company remediated a material weakness related to
income taxes.   Except as otherwise discussed above, there have been no changes
in the Companys internal control over financial reporting
during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.
