31 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Stockholders of Health Grades, Inc. We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Health Grades, Inc. a Delaware corporation as
of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2005. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Health Grades, Inc. as of December31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements
taken as a whole. ScheduleII is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a
required part of the basic financial statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, is fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

See accompanying notes to financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Health Grades, Inc. Notes to Financial Statements December31, 2005 and 2004 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Health Grades, Inc. HealthGrades provides proprietary, objective healthcare provider ratings
and advisory services. Our ratings address hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies. We
provide our clients with healthcare information, including information relating to quality of
service and detailed profile information on physicians, that enables them to measure, assess,
enhance and market healthcare quality. Our clients include hospitals, employers, benefits
consulting firms, payers, insurance companies and consumers. We offer services to hospitals that are either attempting to communicate their clinical excellence
to their internal staff, consumers and physicians or are working to improve quality. For hospitals
that have received high ratings, we offer the opportunity to license our ratings and trademarks and
provide assistance in their marketing programs at an institutional level e.g., hospital clinical
excellence and exceptional experience regarding the overall number and type of patient safety
incidents within a hospital at a service line level e.g. cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, etc. and
at a medical issue level e.g., coronary bypass surgery, community acquired pneumonia, valve
replacement surgery, etc. We also offer physician-led quality improvement consulting engagements
and other quality improvement analysis and services for any hospitals that are seeking to enhance
quality. In addition, we provide basic and detailed profile information on a variety of providers and
facilities. We make this information available to consumers, employers, benefits consulting firms
and payers to assist them in selecting healthcare providers. Basic profile information for certain
providers is available free of charge on our website, www.healthgrades.com. For a fee, we offer
healthcare quality reports with respect to hospitals, nursing homes and physicians. These reports
provide more detailed information than is available free of charge on our website. Report pricing
and content varies based upon the type of provider and whether the user is a consumer or a
healthcare professional for example, a medical professional underwriter. We provide detailed online healthcare quality information for employers, benefits consulting firms,
payers and other organizations that license our Quality Ratings Suite of products Hospital
Quality Guide, Physician Quality Guide, Nursing Home Quality Guide and Home Health Quality
Guide. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USE OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes. These estimates are based on
managements current knowledge of events and actions they may undertake in the future, and actual
results could differ from those estimates. REVENUE RECOGNITION Ratings and advisory revenue Strategic Quality Initiative, Strategic Quality Partnerships and Quality Assessment and Improvement
Programs Our ratings and advisory revenue is generated principally from annual fees paid by hospitals that
participate in our Strategic Quality Initiative SQI, Strategic Quality Partnership SQP
formerly, Distinguished Hospital Program or, DHP and Quality Assessment and Improvement QAI
programs. The SQI program provides business development tools to hospitals that are highly rated on
our website. Under the SQI program, we license the HealthGrades name and our report card ratings
to hospitals. The license may be in a single service line for example, Cardiac or multiple
service lines for example, Cardiac, Neuroscience and Orthopedics. We also 37 Table of Contents assist hospitals in promoting their ratings and measuring the success of their efforts utilizing
our team of in-house healthcare consultants. Our SQI and SQP programs provide a license to highly rated hospitals, enabling them to utilize our
name and certain ratings information for an annual period. Another feature of the SQI and SQP
programs is a detailed comparison of the data underlying a hospitals rating to local and national
benchmarks. Our SQP program recognizes clinical excellence in hospitals among a range of service
lines. Hospitals that contract with us for SQP services receive all of the SQI features described
above with respect to their licensed service lines. In addition, hospitals can reference the
additional DHA Distinguished Hospital Award designation. Hospital clients are provided with
additional marketing and planning assistance related to the DHA designation as well as trophies for
display at the hospital. DHP-PS Distinguished Hospital Award Program for Patient Safety
recognizes hospitals with the best patient safety records in the nation. This award recognizes
exceptional outcomes based on thirteen patient safety indicators from the Agency for Healthcare on
Quality Research. Under our DHP-PS program, we license the commercial use of the HealthGrades
corporate mark, applicable data and marketing messages that may be used by hospitals to demonstrate
third party validation of excellence. Our QAI program is principally designed to help hospitals measure and improve the quality of their
care in particular areas where they have lower ratings. Using our database and focusing on a
particular hospitals information and ratings we can help identify areas to improve quality and
measure how well the hospital performs relative to national and regional best practices. Our
consultants work on-site with the hospital staff and physicians to present the data and assist in
the quality analysis. We typically receive a non-refundable payment at the beginning of each year of the contract term
which is typically three years, subject to a cancellation right by either the client or us, on
each annual anniversary date. We record the cash payment as deferred revenue that is then
amortized to revenue on a straight-line basis over the respective year of the term. Certain of
our products represent a one-time delivery of data. For these arrangements, we recognize revenue
at the time that the data is delivered. Quality Ratings Suite Through our Quality Ratings Suite QRS, we license access to, and customize our database for
employers, benefits consulting firms, payers and others. Modules currently available for license
are the Hospital Quality Guide, Physician Quality Guide, Nursing Home Quality Guide and Home Health
Quality Guide. Some of our revenue for this product is derived through a relationship with
Ingenix. Typically, Ingenix will add the HealthGrades QRS functionality to services available to
its existing clients who license Ingenix provider lookup online application. An additional
licensing fee is charged, of which a portion is payable to us, with Ingenix retaining the remaining
part of the fee. We only recognize the fees that will ultimately be paid to us as revenue from
Ingenix, and not the entire amount of the licensing fee. We recognize revenues related to these
agreements in a straight-line manner over the term of the agreement. In November2005, we provided notice to Ingenix that we would not renew the agreement, and the
agreement terminated on December31, 2005. Under the terms of the agreement, we and Ingenix will
continue to perform services under any ongoing customer license for joint HealthGrades/Ingenix
customers until the expiration or termination of the initial term of the license. In accordance
with the agreement, we are now utilizing the physician data derived from Ingenix solely for
existing joint HealthGrades/Ingenix customers. Healthcare Quality Reports We offer comprehensive quality information to professionals and consumers that provides current and
historical quality information on hospitals and nursing homes in more detail than is available on
our website. In addition, we offer reports on physicians that contain detailed information with
respect to education, professional licensing history and other items. As pricing is usually on a
per report basis, we recognize revenue as reports are ordered and delivered to the customer. COMMISSION EXPENSE With respect to our SQI, SQP and QAI sales, we record the commission expense in the period it is
earned, which is typically upon contract execution for the first year of the agreement and on each
anniversary date for clients that do not cancel in the second or third year of the contract term.
We record the commission expense in this manner because once a contract is signed, the salesperson
has no remaining obligations to perform during the agreement in order to earn the commission. 38 Table of Contents PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS We incur product development costs related to the development and support of our website and the
development of applications to support data compilation and extraction for our consulting services
and modification of our quality guides. These costs which consist primarily of salaries and
benefits, consulting fees and other costs related to software development, application development
and operations expense are expensed as incurred unless they meet the capitalization criteria of
AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use SOP 98-1. During 2005, we had one application that met the criteria
for cost capitalization as described in Note 5. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash, overnight investment accounts that include
short-term U.S. government obligations with maturities not exceeding three months and investments
in U.S. government and government agency debt securities with original maturities not exceeding
three months. Such investments are stated at cost, which includes accrued interest on our
short-term government obligations, which approximates fair value given the short maturity dates,
and are considered cash equivalents for purposes of reporting cash flows. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS The Company invests in U.S. government and government agency debt securities with maturity dates of
180days or less. These securities are classified as held-to-maturity because we have the positive
intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at
amortized cost, which approximates fair value given the short maturity dates, adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discounts to maturity. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts of financial instruments, as reported in the accompanying balance sheets,
approximate their fair value primarily due to the short-term and/or variable-rate nature of such
financial instruments. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The majority of our accounts receivable are due from hospitals. Accounts receivable are due within
30days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due. We
determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade
accounts receivables are past due, any previous loss history and the customers ability to pay its
obligations. We write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments
subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT Property and equipment are stated at cost. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as
incurred. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives
of the underlying assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the
straight-line method over the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful lives of
the underlying assets. The estimated useful lives used are as follows   
Computer equipment and software
3-5years   Furniture and fixtures
5-7years   Leasehold improvements
6years INTANGIBLE ASSETS During 2005, we paid $235,000 to acquire certain intangible assets survey tools as well as a
survey builder application from the Foundation for Accountability, a not-for-profit organization.
These tools are intended to enable consumers to compare their healthcare experience to
evidenced-based guidelines for specific conditions. These assets are being amortized over their
expected useful life of between 3-5years. We evaluate the
carrying value of these assets in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets SFAS142. GOODWILL 39 Table of Contents Goodwill, which is stated at cost, is evaluated annually for impairment in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS142. See Note 6 for discussion of our annual impairment test performed in accordance
with SFAS 142. NET INCOME LOSSPER COMMON SHARE We compute net income lossper common share in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No128, Earnings Per share SFAS 128. Under the provisions of SFAS 128, basic net
income lossper common share is computed by dividing the net income lossfor the period by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income loss
per common share is computed by dividing the net income lossfor the period by the weighted
average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Common
share equivalents, composed of incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of common
stock options and warrants are included in diluted net income lossper share to the extent these
shares are dilutive, utilizing the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method utilizes the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year and the assumed exercise of dilutive
stock options and warrants, less the number of treasury shares assumed to be purchased from the
proceeds using the average market price of our common stock during the year. Common share
equivalents are not included in our computation of diluted net loss per common share for the years
ended December31, 2003 because the effect on net loss per common share would be antidilutive.
Common share equivalents excluded from our calculation of diluted net loss per common share because
their effect would be antidilutive totaled 2,017,064 for the year ended December31, 2003. In
addition, as of December31, 2005 and 2004, options to purchase 70,371 and 2,054,356 shares of
common stock, respectively, were excluded from our calculation of dilutive securities as the
exercise prices were above the market price for our common stock. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the
years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION We account for our stock-based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method under the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APBNo25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees APB25, and related interpretations. Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123, and has
been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method
of that accounting pronouncement. The fair value for options awarded during the years ended
December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 were estimated at the date of grant using the Black Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rate over the
life of the option of 132% to 437%; no dividend yield; and expected three year lives of the
options. Volatility factors used in 2005 were between 111 to 158. Volatility factors used in
2004 were between 151 and 178. The volatility factors utilized for the year ended December31,
2003 were between 195 and 204. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock
price volatility. For purposes of pro forma disclosure, the estimated fair value of the options is amortized to

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Share-Based Payments In December2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R. SFAS123R requires employee stock
options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the
fair value method, and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic
value method prescribed by APB25, and allowed under the original provisions of SFAS123.
SFAS 123R requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value, which is
amortized to expense over the service periods. SFAS 123R is effective for public companies for
fiscal years that begin after June15, 2005. In March2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB107.
Share-Based Payment, to provide additional guidance to public companies in applying the provisions
of SFAS123R. During 2005, the FASB issued three FASB Staff Positions FSP: FSP FAS
123R-1, Classification and Measurement of Freestanding Financial Instruments Originally Issued in
Exchange for Employee Services under FASB Statement No123R, FSP FAS 123R-2, Practical
Accommodation to the Application of Grant Date as Defined in FASB Statement No123R, and FSP FAS
123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment
Awards. We will adopt the provisions of SAB 107 in conjunction with the adoption of SFAS123R and also consider the guidance provided in the FSPs as we consider the effect that
SFAS123R will have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We account for our stock-based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method under the
provisions of APB25 and related interpretations. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the
appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method
for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption. The transition
methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options. Under the
modified retrospective option, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year
of adoption or for all periods presented. The modified prospective method requires that
compensation expense be recorded for all previously unvested stock options and restricted stock as
they vest, and for all awards issued or modified beginning on January1, 2006. We have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective transition method. With respect to
unvested options that were granted during 2005 and prior years, we will recognize compensation cost
as expense based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated using the Black Scholes
option pricing model previously utilized under SFAS 123 for proforma disclosures. We expect to record additional compensation expense related to our adoption of SFAS 123R with
respect to the stock options that are outstanding as of December31, 2005 of approximately $675,000
for the year ended December31, 2006. Depending upon the 41 Table of Contents amount of any share-based payments granted during 2006, this amount may not be indicative of the
actual expense we incur during 2006.
Rental Costs During a Construction Period In October2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FSP FAS 13-1, Accounting for
Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period FSP FAS 13-1. Based on the provisions of FSP
FAS 13-1, lessees are not permitted to capitalize rental costs associated with either ground or
building operating leases that are allocated to the construction period. These costs must be
recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations. FSP FAS 13-1 is
effective for us beginning January1, 2006. As described in Note 13, Leases, during 2005 we entered into a lease agreement for a new location
in Golden, Colorado effective in February2005. During the construction period, prior to our
occupancy, we capitalized approximately one and a half months of construction period rent,
including common area maintenance charges, totaling approximately $65,000. This amount is being
amortized to rent expense over the sixty-three month term of our lease. FSP FAS 13-1 permits, but
does not require, retrospective application of this position. We do not plan to apply this FSP
retrospectively to previously capitalized rental costs. Based on the provisions of FSP FAS 13-1 if
we enter into any new leases in the future, we will no longer capitalize any construction period
rent.
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections In May2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No20
and FASB Statement No3 SFAS 154. SFAS 154 replaces APB Opinion No20, Accounting Changes, and
FASB Statement No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements, and changes the
requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes required by
an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include
specific transition provisions. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in
accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or
the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 is effective for us
beginning January1, 2006. We do not
believe that the adoption of SFAS154 will have a significant
effect on our financial statements. 3. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND RATINGS AND ADVISORY SERVICES REVENUE Accounts receivable consisted of the following

September2005 collectively, the Agreement, with Hewitt Associates LLC Hewitt. Under the
Agreement, as initially executed, we will develop and host applications that will enable Hewitts
clients to make available to their employees and other participants enhanced Health Grades
healthcare quality information as well as other information regarding providers in a particular
health plans network. Such information will include our hospital and physician quality
information along with health plan supplied data. Although the applications we are developing is being tailored for use by Hewitt, the software is
internally developed software, as defined in SOP 98-1. The arrangement with Hewitt is designed to
be similar to a hosting arrangement under which Hewitt will not have the ability to take possession
of the software; instead, the software functions as a means to display the quality information that
is being passed to Hewitts clients. In addition, we may utilize some or all of the software to
disseminate information to other customers as well. Based upon the guidance from SOP 98-1, costs
incurred during the application development stage such as software configuration and interfaces,
coding, installation to hardware and testing of the application we are building are being
capitalized. We will continue to capitalize application development costs until the project is
substantially complete and ready for its intended use after all substantial testing is completed.
Thereafter, we will begin amortizing these costs over the useful life of the application, which we
expect to be three years. As of December31, 2005, we capitalized approximately $400,000 of costs
with respect to this application, which are included in computer equipment and software in the
property and equipment table in Note 4, Property and Equipment. Under the Agreement, during an initial evaluation period that ended on December31, 2005, we
provided pilot services to one Hewitt client. The Agreement provided that, at the end of the
evaluation period, Hewitt would determine whether we were successful in providing the pilot
services. In addition, during the evaluation period, Hewitt would evaluate our capacity to
collect, process, integrate, deploy, maintain and update provider-specific data received from
health plans that will enable a Hewitt client participant to determine the identity of providers in
a health plans network. If Hewitt determined that the pilot services were not successful or
otherwise do not warrant continuation of the Agreement, or if Hewitt determined that we are not
capable of providing the services relating to provider-specific data on an ongoing basis, Hewitt
could terminate the Agreement, or, in connection with services relating to provider-specific data,
continue the agreement subject to fee reductions. For the year ended December31, 2005, $400,000 has been included in our ratings and advisory
revenue in the attached statement of operations with respect to fees related to the initial pilot
services. If Hewitts evaluations were favorable, Hewitt would pay to us a fee based upon the total number of
Hewitt clients participants with access to our websites, and the type of services to which the
participants have access, in accordance with a fee schedule attached to the Agreement, subject to
minimum payments of $3,000,000 per annum in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The Agreement contains most favored nation provisions under which the fees payable to Hewitt are
subject to reduction if we offer similar services to another customer at a materially lower price.
The Agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that Hewitt is obtaining pricing and
levels of service that are competitive with market rates, prices and service levels given the
nature, volume and specific type of services provided by us. The Agreement provides for fee
negotiation in the event specified competitive criteria are not met, and Hewitt may terminate the
Agreement if an adjustment is not agreed upon. The Agreement also provides that we will not, prior to the earlier of August31, 2007 or the
termination of the Agreement due to certain specified events, develop, market, sell or license to
any third party a service or search tool that contains substantially the same 43 Table of Contents functionality as the search tool and websites provided under the Agreement. However, we generally
will not be precluded from continuing to provide services and products including upgrades to such
services and products that we provided to our general customer base on the date of the Agreement
so long as Hewitts proprietary rights and other materials are not used in connection with the
services or products. The Agreement also contains mutual royalty-free, non-exclusive, licenses of certain data,
information and materials owned by or licensed by third-parties to Health Grades and Hewitt. In
addition, the parties agreed to certain confidentiality provisions, and we agreed to certain data
security and non-solicitation requirements relating to Hewitt clients. The Agreement will continue until December31, 2009, subject to automatic renewal for up to two
consecutive one-year terms, unless either party provides 90days notice of an intent not to renew.
The contract is subject to earlier termination as described above. In addition, Hewitt will have
the right to terminate the Agreement under other circumstances, including a Change of Control as
defined in the Agreement of us. On December31, 2005, we received a communication from Hewitt that they believe we will ultimately
provide the services called for by the Agreement, but that they believed it would take a longer
period of time before we would be able to do so. They requested an extension of the evaluation
period, together with certain modifications of the Agreement. See Note 19 for an update on the
status of our Agreement with Hewitt. 6. GOODWILL As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142, we discontinued the amortization of goodwill
effective January1, 2002. SFAS 142 describes various potential methodologies for determining fair
value, including market capitalization if a public company has one reporting unit, discounted
cash flow analysis present value technique and techniques based on multiples of earnings,
revenue, earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization, and/or other financial
measures. SFAS 142 also states that if a valuation technique is used that considers multiple
sources of information, such as an average of the quoted market prices of the reporting unit over a
specific time period and the results of a present value technique, the company should apply that
technique consistently period to period i.e., in the required annual impairment analysis in
subsequent years. As
HealthGrades consists of only one reporting unit, and is publicly
traded, we began our
fair value analysis with an evaluation of our market capitalization. We applied a market
capitalization approach by multiplying the number of actual shares outstanding by an average market
price. During 2003 and 2004 we applied an additional premium of 20% to this valuation to give effect to managements
best estimate of a control premium. Given that during
this period, management and a venture capital investor owned a
substantial portion of our outstanding shares, management believed a
premium of 20% was reasonable
to give effect to additional benefits a purchaser would derive from control of HealthGrades.
Effective
with the impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2005, we eliminated the control premium
as our remaining venture capital investor sold over half of its remaining shares of our common
stock. As such, we believe that a control premium is no longer appropriate. As our shares are thinly traded, management believes that any analysis of HealthGrades fair value
should include valuation techniques in addition to overall market capitalization. We contemplated
utilizing cost, market or income approaches. However, utilization of cost or market approaches was
not feasible, particularly given the fact that HealthGrades does not fall into an easily
identifiable peer group of companies from which to compare valuations in the form of
price/earnings ratios, sales of similar companies, etc. Therefore, management determined to
utilize an approach using the present value of expected future cash flows as an additional
valuation technique. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting cash flows, in
particular for a growth company, management developed a range of possible cash flows and derived a
probability-weighted average of the range of possible amounts to determine the expected cash flow. After deriving the market capitalization and expected cash flow valuations as described above, we
then applied an equal weighting to each model to derive an overall fair value estimate of
HealthGrades. As required under SFAS 142, we performed our annual test for 44 Table of Contents impairment of our goodwill during the fourth quarters of 2003, 2004 and 2005. These tests
resulted in no additional impairment to our goodwill balance. We will perform the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of subsequent years, or sooner, if
indicators of impairment arise at an interim date. Any impairment identified during the annual
impairment tests will be recorded as an operating expense in our statement of operations. We
expect to continue to utilize the combined market capitalization and expected cash flow approach
described above to perform our annual impairment analysis and interim tests if necessary. 7. INTANGIBLE ASSETS During
2005, we paid $236,000 to acquire certain intangible assets survey tools as well as a
survey builder application from the Foundation for Accountability, a not-for-profit organization.
These tools are intended to enable consumers to compare their healthcare experience to
evidenced-based guidelines for specific conditions. Amortization of intangible assets was approximately
$58,000 in 2005. We capitalized approximately $118,000 to the survey
builder application, which is being amortized over its estimated
useful life of five years and $118,000 to the survey tools, which is
being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years.
Expected amortization expense related to these assets for the next five
years are as follows

8. DEFERRED RENT As of December31, 2005, we had approximately $382,000 recorded as deferred rent in our
accompanying balance sheet. Deferred rent relates principally to cash payments we received from
the landlord of our new office facility as reimbursement for tenant improvements we made. In
addition, deferred rent includes approximately one and a half months of construction period rent
from the period beginning on the date upon which we accepted delivery of the premises and ending
when we actually moved into the facility. Deferred rent will be amortized as a reduction to rent
expense over the 63month term of our lease. 9. STOCK AND WARRANT REPURCHASE Pursuant to a Stock and Warrant Repurchase Agreement, dated March11, 2003, we paid a former
venture capital investor, Chancellor V., L.P. Chancellor $500,000 to repurchase all 12,004,333
shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 1,971,820 shares of our common stock that
Chancellor had acquired through certain financing transactions in 2000 and 2001. Immediately prior
to the repurchase, Chancellors ownership of HealthGrades common stock represented 33% of our
outstanding common stock, and Chancellors ownership of HealthGrades common stock and warrants
represented 36% of our total outstanding common stock assuming full exercise of the warrants held
by Chancellor, but assuming no exercise of any other warrants or options. 10. BANK LINE OF CREDIT AND TERM LOAN On May13, 2002, we completed a line of credit arrangement the Agreement with Silicon Valley
Bank. Under the terms of the Agreement, we were entitled to request advances not to exceed an
aggregate amount of $10million subject to a limit of 75% of Eligible Accounts as defined in the
Agreement plus 50% of our cash invested with Silicon Valley Bank, over the one-year term of the
Agreement. Through subsequent amendments, we extended the term of the Agreement to February13,
2006. We did not borrow any funds under the Agreement. However, in connection with a lease we
executed for our new headquarters in Golden, Colorado, in December2004, we executed a standby
letter of credit with Silicon Valley Bank in January2005, for $500,000, which reduced the
amount we could request as an advance under the Agreement. Therefore, as of December31, 2005 500,000 of our line of credit was available to us. Advances under the Agreement were to bear
interest at Silicon Valley Banks prime rate plus 075% and be secured by substantially all of our
assets. In addition, an amendment to the Agreement provided for a term loan of $500,000, which carried an
interest rate of 594% and was due on March1, 2005. In October2003, we repaid the balance of the
term loan. In February2006, our line of credit arrangement with Silicon Valley Bank expired, and we did not
renew the arrangement. We anticipate that our $500,000 standby letter of credit with Silicon
Valley Bank will be secured as a compensating balance against the cash and cash equivalents we
maintain with Silicon Valley Bank. 45 Table of Contents 11. COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS During the year ended December31, 2005, warrants to purchase 2,136,600 shares of our common stock
were converted into 2,095,020 shares of our common stock, in accordance with a net exercise
provision of the warrants. In addition, warrants to purchase 41,580 shares of our common stock
were exercised at a price of $026 per share. As of December31, 2005, we had 7,975,186 common shares reserved for future issuance under our 1996
Equity Compensation Plan. 12. STOCK OPTION PLANS On October15, 1996, our Board of Directors approved the 1996 Equity Compensation Plan the Equity
Plan, which initially provided for the grant of options to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of
HealthGrades common stock. The total number of shares authorized for issuance under the Equity Plan
increased to 6,000,000 in 1998, 7,000,000 in 2000, 8,000,000 in 2001 and 13,000,000 in 2002. Our
stockholders approved the Equity Plan and each increase in shares authorized for issuance. Both
incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options may be issued under the provisions of the
Equity Plan. Our employees, members of the Board of Directors and certain consultants and advisors
are eligible to participate in the Equity Plan, which will terminate no later than October14,
2006. Our Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors authorizes the grants and
vesting of options under the Equity Plan. As of December31,
2005, there were 1,744,863 shares
available for future granting under the Equity Plan. A summary of our stock option activity and related information for the years ended December31 is

13. OPERATING LEASES We are obligated under operating leases for our office space and certain office equipment. In
February2004, we added approximately 2,900 square feet of office space to our lease for 12,200
square feet in Lakewood, Colorado. Total annual lease costs for our full-service lease on the
15,100 square feet were approximately $270,000. In December2004, we executed a lease agreement on
an office building at a new location in Golden, Colorado for approximately 28,700 square feet. The
lease term under this new lease began in February2005. The term of the lease is 63months. Future minimum payments under the operating leases with terms in excess of one year are summarized

Rent expense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 under all operating leases
was approximately $400,000, $327,000 and $250,000, respectively. 14. INCOME TAXES We are a corporation subject to federal and certain state and local income taxes. The provision for
income taxes is made pursuant to the liability method as prescribed in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 109. This method requires
recognition of deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the financial reporting
and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, using currently enacted income tax rates and
regulations related to the years such temporary differences become deductible and payable. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December31,
2005 and 2004 are as follows 47 Table of Contents

During the year ended December31, 2005, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was
reduced by $1,500,550. The valuation allowance at December31, 2004 resulted from uncertainty
regarding our ability to realize the benefits of the related deferred tax assets. In accordance
with SFAS 109, we assessed the continuing need for the valuation allowance and concluded that once
we had achieved at least six quarters of net income before tax and cumulative net income before tax
during the most recent 12 quarters, we could reverse the valuation allowance. During the second
quarter of 2005, we met these criteria and determined that the valuation allowance was no longer
required. The income tax benefitexpense for the years ended December31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is summarized

The total income tax expense differs from amounts currently payable because certain revenues
and expenses are reported in the statement of operations in periods that differ from those in which
they are subject to taxation. The principal differences relate to different methods of calculating
depreciation and deferred rent for financial statement and income tax purposes, currently
deductible book prepaid amounts and currently non-deductible book accruals and reserves. The current income tax expense summarized above for the year ended December31, 2005 does not
include a tax benefit of $1,155,187 related to certain employee stock option transactions. In
accordance with SFAS 109, this tax benefit has been recorded as an increase to stockholders equity
in the accompanying balance sheet. In addition, this tax benefit has been recorded as a cash flow
from operations in the accompanying statement of cash flows. A reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax rate of 34% and our 02%, 00% and 00%

48 Table of Contents We have approximately $3,200,000 in net operating loss carryforwards which may be used to
offset future taxable income. These loss carryforwards expire from 2019 through 2023. Certain
changes in our stock ownership during 2001 resulted in an ownership change pursuant to the tax laws
and, due to this change, approximately $800,000 of our net operating loss carryforwards are subject
to restrictions on the timing of their use. The remaining $2,400,000 of net operating loss
carryforwards are not subject to any use limitations. 15. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Strategic
Performance Fund - II On or about October10, 2002, Strategic Performance Fund II SPF-II commenced an action in the
Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida against us, alleging
breach of two leases. These leases relate to two buildings in which one of our former affiliated
practices, Orthopaedic Associates, P.A. d/b/a Park Place Therapeutic Center Park Place leased
office space. Park Place ceased the payment of its rental obligations with respect to the two
leases in May2000, and subsequently filed a petition for bankruptcy, under Chapter11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, in the United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida, Ft.
Lauderdale Division. SPF-II sought damages against us in the amount of approximately $47million. The basis of the allegation against us was that while under the corporate name of Specialty Care
Network, Inc., we entered into an Assignment, Assumption and Release Agreement dated July8, 1997,
under which we assumed the obligations of Orthopaedic Management Services, Inc., as lessee, under
its Lease Agreement with the owner and lessor, Park Place Orthopaedic Center II, Ltd. The
agreement was executed in connection with our acquisition of most of the non-medical assets of the
Park Place practice. On October1, 1997, the owner of the leased property sold its interests in
the leasehold estates to SPF-II. On June10, 1999, we sold the assets of the Park Place practice,
including the leasehold interests, back to Park Place and entered into an Absolute Assignment and
Assumption Agreement with Park Place, under which Park Place agreed to indemnify us in connection
with the leasehold obligations. In addition, we entered into an Indemnification Agreement with
Park Place and its individual physician owners, under which the individual physician owners
severally up to their ownership interest in the practice agreed to indemnify us in connection
with the leasehold obligations. SPF-II alleged that, notwithstanding the assignment of our
leasehold interests to Park Place, HealthGrades remains liable for all lessee obligations under the
leases. We filed a response to the initial complaint instituted by SPF-II, denying all liability with
respect to the subject leases. In addition, we filed a third-party complaint against the
individual physician owners seeking indemnification from each of these individuals under the terms
of the Indemnification Agreement. The physician owners filed a response to our complaint denying
their liability under the Indemnification Agreement, and asserting several affirmative defenses,
including, among others, our failure to mitigate damages, lack of consideration, our assertion of a
premature claim as liability and damages have not been established by SPF-II, rejection of the
leases by the bankruptcy court, and, in the case of one physician owner, a claim that an agent of
ours who was, in fact, an employee of Park Place both before and after our affiliation with the
practice fraudulently induced the purchase of the Park Place practices assets from us. The
physician owners also filed a motion to enjoin further prosecution of the action instituted against
them by us and Bank of America, the lender in connection with their repurchase of the assets of the
Park Place practice, pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceeding. In November2003, we executed a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release the Settlement
Agreement with SPF-II, Orthopaedic Associates, P.A. d/b/a Park Place Therapeutic Center Park
Place and four of the physician owners of Park Place, in connection with a legal proceeding
concerning an alleged breach by us of two leases. In consideration for the dismissal of all claims
and mutual releases, we paid approximately $441,000 into an escrow account to be released to SPF-II
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions of the Settlement Agreement. In addition, we agreed to
pay an additional $50,000 to SPF-II on or before September25, 2004. The aggregate payment amount
of $491,000 was recorded as an expense in our statement of operations in the third quarter of 2003.
As the $441,000 payment was made into escrow prior to year end, this cash was removed from our
balance sheet as of December31, 2003. Payment out of escrow was contingent upon the occurrence,
on or before September25, 2004 of ibankruptcy court approval of Chapter11 plans relating to
Park Place and the four physician owners and iithe payment of a specified amount to SPF-II
pursuant to the Chapter11 plans. In April2004, upon satisfaction of the conditions described
above, the $441,000 in the above mentioned escrow account was released to SPF-II. In July2004, we
made the final $50,000 payment to SPF-II, and an order of dismissal was entered on July30, 2004. Idemnification
of our Chief Executive Officer In 2004, we provided indemnification to our Chief Executive Officer, Kerry R. Hicks, for legal fees
totaling approximately $272,000 relating to litigation involving Mr.Hicks. We provided additional
indemnification to Mr. Hicks of approximately $461,000 during 2005. The litigation arose from loans that Mr.
Hicks and three other executive officers provided to us in December1999 in the amount of
$3,350,000 including $2,000,000 individually loaned by Mr.Hicks. These loans enabled us to
purchase a minority interest in an 49 Table of Contents internet healthcare rating business that has become our current healthcare provider rating and
advisory services business. Although we were the majority owner of the business, we had agreed
with the minority interest holder that if we failed to purchase the holders interest by December
31, 1999, we would relinquish control and majority ownership to the holder. In March2000, the
executive officers converted our obligations to them including the $2,000,000 owed to Mr.Hicks
into our equity securities in order to induce several private investors to invest an aggregate of
$14,800,000 in our equity securities. The executive officers personally borrowed money from our principal lending bank in order to fund
their loans to us. In early 2001, the bank claimed that Mr.Hicks was obligated to pay amounts
owed to the bank by a former executive who was unable to fully repay his loan; Mr.Hicks denied
this obligation. In October2002, the bank sold the note to an affiliate of a collection agency
the collection agency and the affiliate are collectively referred to as the collection agency.
Although the bank informed the collection agency in July2003 of the banks conclusion that Mr.
Hicks was not obligated under the former executives promissory note issued to the bank, the
collection agency commenced litigation in September2003 in federal court in Tennessee to collect
the remaining balance of approximately $350,000 on the note and named Mr.Hicks as a defendant. On
motion by Mr.Hicks, the court action was stayed, and Mr.Hicks commenced an arbitration proceeding
against the collection agency in October2003, seeking an order that he had no liability under the
note and asserting claims for damages. The bank was added as a party in March2004. The bank repurchased the note from the collection agency in December2003 and resold the note to
another third party in February2004, so that Mr.Hicks obligation to repay the note was no longer
at issue. The remaining claims included, among others, claims by the bank against Mr.Hicks for
costs and expenses of collection of the loan, claims by the collection agency against Mr.Hicks for
abuse of process and tortious interference with the relationship between the bank and the
collection agency and claims by Mr.Hicks against the bank for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud,
and against the collection agency for abuse of process and defamation. Mr.Hicks also commenced
litigation against the other parties, as well as two individuals affiliated with the collection
agency together with the collection agency, the collection agency parties, based on similar
claims. That case was removed to federal court by the defendants. Mr.Hicks later filed an amended
complaint against the collection agency parties in federal district court for abuse of process,
defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The federal district court determined
that Mr.Hicks claims should be submitted to the arbitration proceeding, but in January2005, the
arbitrator stayed Mr.Hicks federal court claims and the collection agencys claims against Mr.
Hicks for abuse of process and tortious interference until after consideration of the other pending
claims. An arbitration hearing was held in February2005 on the other claims submitted by the
parties. In April2005, the arbitrator announced his determination. The arbitrator ruled that the
collection agency was liable to Mr.Hicks in the amount of $400,000 for emotional distress and
other maladies as well as attorneys fees in the amount of $15,587 with interest as a result of the
collection agencys abuse of process in initiating the action in federal court in Tennessee. The
arbitrator determined that the bank had no liability. Mr.Hicks has not been paid the arbitration award. The collection agency sought reconsideration of
the ruling by the arbitrator, who denied the request. Mr.Hicks filed a motion with the federal
district court to confirm the arbitration award, and the court confirmed the award on October26,
2005. The collection agency filed a notice of appeal in connection with the federal district
courts confirmation of the arbitration award entered in favor of Mr.Hicks. Counsel for Mr.Hicks
has advised us that Mr.Hicks has filed a motion to dismiss the notice of appeal because several
claims remain unresolved by the court and the district court did not certify its ruling for appeal. The
hearing on the remaining matters in the arbitration was
held February28, 2006 through March3, 2006. The
arbitrator who heard these claims died unexpectedly a few days
after the arbitration hearing was complete and did not issue a
ruling. A new arbitrator has been appointed. It is anticipated that,
during April 2006, the new arbitrator will set procedures under which
the remaining claims will be decided. Our determination to indemnify Mr.Hicks was based on, among other things, the fact that the
dispute related to Mr.Hicks efforts and personal financial commitment to provide funds to us in
December1999, without which we likely would not have remained
viable. Mr.Hicks has advised us that he intends to reimburse us
for all indemnification expenses we have incurred and continue to
incur, from the proceeds of any final award paid to him, net of any
income taxes payable by him resulting from the award. By a letter to our Board of Directors dated February13, 2006, one of the collection agency parties
made allegations directed at us, Mr.Hicks and the attorneys representing Mr.Hicks in the
arbitration. The principal allegations appear to be that we, Mr.Hicks and the attorneys conspired
to enter into an illegal arrangement with an account officer of the bank whose loan was the initial
subject of the arbitration, without the banks knowledge, that enabled us to indirectly obtain
funds from the bank and, in conspiracy with the late arbitrator, prevented the collection agency parties
from reporting the alleged conduct to government authorities. The collection agency party
threatened suit if it is not paid $103million. We believe these allegations are absurd and completely without merit. To our knowledge, the
collection agency parties have not sought to assert any such claims against us in the
arbitration. We will vigorously contest any litigation that may be brought against us by the
collection agency parties. We are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our
business. In the opinion of management, these actions are unlikely to materially affect our
financial position. 16. COMMITMENTS We have entered into employment agreements that provide two executives with minimum base pay,
annual incentive awards and other fringe benefits. We expense all costs related to the agreements
in the period that the services are rendered by the employee. In the event of death, disability,
termination with or without cause, voluntary employee termination, or change in our ownership, we
may be partially or wholly relieved of our financial obligations to such individuals. However,
under certain circumstances, a change in control of us may provide significant and immediate
enhanced compensation to the executives. At December31, 2005, we were contractually 50 Table of Contents obligated to pay base pay compensation to these executives of approximately $530,000 through
December31, 2006. 17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN We maintain a defined contribution employee benefit plan the Benefit Plan. The Benefit Plan
covers substantially all HealthGrades employees and includes a qualified non-elective contribution
equal to 3% of annual compensation, applicable to all eligible participants, regardless of whether
or not the participant contributes to the Benefit Plan. Expense under the Benefit Plan, including the Qualified Non-Elective Contribution, aggregated
approximately $178,000, $139,000 and $116,000 for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 18. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNAUDITED The following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended December31,

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Hewitt Agreement On March28, 2006, we filed a Demand for Arbitration before the American Arbitration
Association against Hewitt Associates LLC Hewitt. The Demand for Arbitration relates to a
Development and Services Agreement with Hewitt that we entered into effective June30, 2005, as
amended, the Agreement. Under the Agreement, we were to develop and host applications that
would enable Hewitts clients to make available to their employees and other participants enhanced
Health Grades health care quality information as well as other information regarding providers in
a particular health plans network. Such information was to include our hospital and physician
quality information along with health plan supplied data. Under the Agreement, during an initial evaluation period that ended on December31, 2005, we
provided pilot services to one Hewitt client. The Agreement provided that, at the end of the
evaluation period, Hewitt would determine whether we were successful in providing the pilot
services. In addition, during the evaluation period, Hewitt was to evaluate our capacity to
collect, process, integrate, deploy, maintain and update provider-specific data received from
health plans that would enable a Hewitt client participant to determine the identity of providers
in a health plans network Network Tag Services. If Hewitt determined that the pilot services
were not successful or otherwise did not warrant continuation of the Agreement, or if Hewitt
determined that we are not suitable to provide the Network Tag Services, Hewitt could terminate
the Agreement. The Agreement provided that notice of such termination must be sent to us no later
than December31, 2005. If Hewitts evaluations were favorable, Hewitt would pay to us a fee based upon the total number of
Hewitt clients participants with access to our websites, and the type of services to which the
participants have access, in accordance with a fee schedule attached to the Agreement, subject to
minimum payments of $3million per annum in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The Demand for Arbitration alleges, among other things, that on December31, 2005, Hewitt sent us a
letter in which Hewitt concluded that the provision of the pilot services was successful, and
that, with regard to the Network Tag Services, the health plans have been slow to respond to the
Hewitt/Health Grades request for data. Moreover, the Demand for Arbitration alleges that Hewitt
did not terminate the Agreement on December31, 2005 and that follow up e-mails from Hewitt made
reference to Hewitts desire to amend the existing Agreement.... The Demand for Arbitration
further alleges that our response to Hewitts December31, letter, while committing us to the
relationship, reminded Hewitt that bringing the health plan information to us is one of the
principal responsibilities Hewitt has under the Agreement. In addition, the Demand for Arbitration
states that, on March10, 2006, Hewitt claimed that the December31, 2005 letter invoked the right
to terminate the Agreement, even though the December31 letter makes no reference to terminating
the Agreement; moreover, on March15, 2006, Hewitt administrators refused to continue to perform
Hewitts obligations under the Agreement. In the Demand for Arbitration, we claim, among other things, that Hewitt has willfully repudiated
and breached the terms of the Agreement by falsely contending that it had the right to terminate
the Agreement based on our performance of the pilot services and the Network Tag Services; by
refusing to continue to perform under the Hewitt Agreement; and by falsely contending that we had
materially breached the Agreement when Hewitt had precluded us from providing services under the Agreement and our performance had at all times been commendable. We
are seeking $21million in damages, plus costs. Hewitt has not yet responded to the Demand for Arbitration. Item1.

Item5. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is i
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
and forms and iiaccumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. 52 Table of Contents Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the Companys most
recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. Item9B. Other Information On March
28, 2006, Mark Pacala resigned as a director of Health Grades, Inc.,
effective following the Board of Directors meeting on March 29, 2006. Under
agreements executed in March 2000, Health Grades and certain of its
current and former executive officers generally agreed to take such
actions including in the case of the individuals, voting their
shares as were in their control so that one designee of Essex
Woodlands Health Ventures Fund IV, L.P. Essex was
elected to the Board of Directors. Mr. Pacala, a Managing Director of
Essex, was Essexs designee. These agreements terminated once
Essex held less than five percent of Health Grades outstanding
common stock. On February 27, 2006, Essex sold all remaining shares
of Health Grades Stock that it then owned. PART III
