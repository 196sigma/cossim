of LanVision Systems, Inc. as of January31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January31, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule of LanVision Systems,
Inc. listed in . These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Companys
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of LanVision Systems, Inc. at
January31, 2004 and 2003 and the consolidated results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended January31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Also, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule,
when considered in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth herein. Cincinnati, Ohio

STATEMENTS 1.Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies LanVision Systems, Inc. the Company operates in
one segment as a provider of Healthcare Information Technology
Company through the licensing of its Electronic Medical Record
and Patient Financial Services Workflow software applications
and the use of such applications through its application-hosting
services as an Application Service Provider. LanVisions
products enable hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery
systems in the United States to capture, store, manage, route,
retrieve, and process vast amounts of patient clinical and
financial information. Fiscal Year All references to a fiscal year refer to the
fiscal year commencing February 1 in that calendar year and
ending on January31 of the following year. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of LanVision Systems, Inc. and its subsidiary,
LanVision, Inc. All significant intercompany transactions are
eliminated. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003,
LanVision recorded a $290,000 favorable change in the estimate
for certain franchise tax liabilities as a result of the tax
authority audit of certain prior years tax returns, which
adjustment contributed to the 2003 decrease in selling, general
and administrative expenses. Revenue Recognition Revenue is derived from: the licensing and sale
of systems, either directly to end-users or through third-party
resellers, comprising internally developed software, third-party
software and hardware components; product support, maintenance
and professional services; and application-hosting services that
provide high quality, transaction or subscription based document
imaging/management services from a central data center.
LanVisions revenue recognition policies conform to
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition.
Generally, revenue from software license fees and hardware sales
to end-users is recognized when a master agreement is signed and
products are made available to end-users. Revenues from
agreements that contain multiple-element arrangements are
allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the
elements. Revenues related to routine installation and
integration and project management are deferred until the work
is performed. If a contract requires LanVision to perform
services and modifications that are deemed significant to system
acceptance, revenues are recorded either on the
percentage-of-completion method or revenues related to the
delivered hardware and software components are deferred until
such obligations are deemed insignificant, depending on the
contractual terms. LanVision follows this method since
reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs
applicable to various stages of a contract can be made.
Recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the
contract progresses to completion. Revisions in profit estimates
are charged or credited to income in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known. Revenues from
consulting, education, and application-hosting services are
recognized as the services are performed. Revenues from
short-term support and maintenance agreements are recognized
ratably over the term of the agreements. Billings to customers
recorded prior to the recognition of revenues are classified as
deferred revenues. Revenues recognized prior to progress
billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables. Under the terms of a Remarketing Agreement with
IDX Information Systems Corporation, royalties are remitted by
IDX to LanVision based upon IDX sublicensing LanVisions
software to IDXs customers. Thirty 37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued percent of the royalty is due 45days
following the end of the month in which IDX executes an end-user
license agreement with its customer. LanVision recognizes this
revenue upon receipt of the royalty report. The remaining
seventy percent of the royalty is due from IDX, in varying
amounts based on implementation milestones, 45days
following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs.
LanVision records this revenue when the seventy percent payment
due from IDX is fixed and determinable, which is generally when
the products are made available to end-users. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand
deposits, overnight deposits, and short-term commercial paper.
The long-term debt agreement See Note 3 requires LanVision to
maintain a minimum cash balance of $3,000,000 through the
maturity of the loan on July31, 2004. Receivables Accounts and contract receivables are comprised
of amounts owed LanVision for licensed software, professional
services, including maintenance services and application-hosting
activities and are net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of
$400,000 at January31, 2004 and 2003. Contracts with
individual customers and resellers determine when receivables
are due. In determining the allowance for doubtful accounts,
each unpaid receivable is reviewed quarterly with the
appropriate LanVision Client Manager to determine the payment
status based upon the most currently available information as to
the status of the receivables, the customer comments, if any,
and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the
customer preventing the payment thereof. Corrective action, if
necessary, is taken by LanVision to resolve open issues related
to unpaid receivables. During these quarterly reviews, LanVision
determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability
of its customers or resellers to make required payments. Concentrations Financial instruments, which potentially expose
LanVision to concentrations of credit risk, as defined by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No105,
Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with
Concentrations of Credit Risk, consist primarily of accounts
receivable. LanVisions accounts receivable are
concentrated in the healthcare industry. However,
LanVisions customers typically have been well-established
hospitals, medical facilities, or major Health Information
Systems companies that resell LanVisions products that
have good credit histories and payments have been received
within normal time frames for the industry. However, some
hospitals and medical facilities have experienced significant
operating losses as a result of limits on third-party
reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental
entities and extended payment of receivables from these entities
is not uncommon. To date, LanVision has relied on a limited number
of customers and remarketing partners for a substantial portion
of its total revenues. LanVision expects that a significant
portion of its future revenues will continue to be generated by
a limited number of customers and its remarketing partners. The
failure to obtain new customers or expand sales through
remarketing partners, the loss of existing customers or
reduction in revenues from existing customers could materially
and adversely affect LanVisions operating results See
Note 6. LanVision currently buys all of its hardware and
some major software components of its Healthcare Information
Systems from third-party vendors. Although there are a limited
number of vendors capable of supplying these components,
management believes that other suppliers could provide similar
components on comparable terms. A change in suppliers, however,
could cause a delay in system implementations and a possible
loss of revenues, which could adversely affect operating results. 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Other Current Assets Other current assets are primarily: prepaid
insurance, commissions, maintenance, deposits, and prepaid
expenses related to future revenues. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line depreciation,
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated
useful lives are as follows   
Computer equipment andsoftware
2-4 years
Officeequipment
5 years
Office furniture andfixtures
7 years
Leaseholdimprovements
Life of lease
Depreciation expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was
$534,499, $383,806 and $385,634, respectively. Leased computer equipment and software meeting
certain criteria are capitalized and the pre nt
value of the related lease payments is recorded as a
liabilit Depreciation of the capitalized lease
assets is computed on the straight-line method over the term of
the lease. Normal repair and maintenance is expensed as
incurred. Replacements are capitalized and the property and
equipment accounts are relieved of the items being replaced or
disposed of, or if no longer of value. The related cost and
accumulated deprecation of the disposed assets are eliminated
and any gain or loss on disposition is included in the results
of operations in the year of disposal. Capitalized Software Development
Costs Software development costs are accounted for in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No86, Accounting for the Costs of Software to be Sold,
Leased or Otherwise Marketed. Costs associated with the
planning and designing phase of software development, including
coding and testing activities necessary to establish
technological feasibility are classified as product research and
development and are expensed as incurred. Once technological
feasibility has been determined, a portion of the costs incurred
in development, including coding, testing, and product quality
assurance, are capitalized and subsequently reported at the
lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. LanVision
capitalized $800,000, $600,000 and $500,000 in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively. Research and development expense, net of
capitalized amounts, was $2,053,901, $2,195,315 and $2,154,949
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Amortization is provided on a product-by-product
basis over the estimated economic life of the software, not to
exceed three years, using the straight-line method. Amortization
commences when a product is available for general release to
customers. Unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in
excess of the net realizable value of a product are expensed at
the date of such determination. Amortization expense was
$500,000, $400,000 and $300,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Other non-current assets Other non-current assets at January31, 2004
consist primarily of deferred tax assets relating to the net
operating loss carry forwards See Note 4. Accrued Other Expenses Accrued other expenses at January31, 2004
and 2003 include warranty reserves, accrued franchise and
property taxes, professional fees and other similar liabilities.
The decrease in fiscal 2003 results primarily from 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued a $290,000 favorable change in the estimate for
certain franchise tax liabilities as a result of the tax
authority audit of certain prior years tax returns. Income Taxes The provisions for income taxes are accounted for
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under the
asset and liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Stock Options Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
establishes a fair value method of financial accounting and
reporting for stock-based compensation plans. LanVision elected
to continue to account for stock options under the intrinsic
value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
and, accordingly, has adopted the disclosure only provisions
of Statement 123. At January31, 2004 LanVision had three
stock-based compensation plans, which are more fully disclosed
in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. No
stock-based compensation cost is reflected in the net earnings,
as all options granted under the plans had exercise prices equal
to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. The following table illustrates the effect on net
earnings and earnings per share as if LanVision had applied the
fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, to stock-based employee
compensation. Pro forma information regarding the net earnings
and net earnings per common share is required by Statement 123,
and has been determined as if LanVision had accounted for its
stock options under the fair value method of that Statement. The
fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions for fiscal year 2003 risk-free
interest rate of 250%, and 2001: risk-free interest rates of
450%; a dividend yield of zero percent; a volatility factor of
the expected market price of LanVisions Common Stock of.916 in 2003 and 1011 in 2001, and a weighted average expected
life of the options of five years. No options were granted in
2002. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options
that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In
addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because LanVisions stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
LanVisions opinion, the existing models do not necessarily
provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock
options. 40 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No128, Earnings per Share. The basic net earnings
per common share are computed based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during each period. The
diluted net earnings per common share reflects the potential
dilution that could occur if Stock Options, Stock Purchase Plan
commitments and Warrants were exercised into Common Stock, under
certain circumstances, that then would share in the earnings of
LanVision. The following is the calculation of the basic and

STATEMENTSContinued 2.Operating
Leases LanVision rents office and data center space and
equipment under noncancelable operating leases that expire at
various times through fiscal year 2006. Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases for the next three
fiscal years are as follows: 2004, $224,815; 2005, $25,648;
2006, $5,690; each year. Rent expense was $229,275, $178,189 and
$139,047 for fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. 3.Long-term Debt
and Capitalized Leases In 1998, LanVision issued a $6,000,000 note to
The HillStreet Fund, L.P., which bears interest at 12%, payable
monthly. The note is repayable in quarterly installments of
$500,000 through July2004. LanVision has the option to
prepay at any time, in full, the outstanding balance of the note
upon the payment of a Special Prepayment Fee. The Special
Prepayment Fee shall be equal to the amount of the Yield
Guarantee to Maturity of 25%, discounted to the present value to
the date of payment in full of the Loan, using an assumed
discount rate of 6%, minus the amount of the interest prepaid
on: September5, 2000, in the amount of $1,000,000,
April2, 2001, in the amount of $500,000, March13,
2002, in the amount of $500,000, and March1, 2004 in the
amount of $1,500,000, all of which are compounded at an assumed
interest rate of 6% through the date of the payment in full of
the Loan. The note is secured by all of the assets of LanVision,
and the loan agreement, as amended, restricts LanVision from
incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money, including
capitalized leases, limits certain investments, restricts
substantial asset sales, capital expenditures, cash dividends,
stock repurchases, and mergers and consolidations with
unaffiliated entities without lender consent. In addition,
LanVision is required to meet certain financial covenants,
including minimum levels of revenues, earnings, and net worth.
Also, the loan agreement requires LanVision to maintain a
minimum cash balance of $3,800,000 through the maturity of the
loan. On March1, 2004 LanVision made a prepayment of
$1,500,000 on the accrued and unpaid interest on the long-term
debt and the lender agreed to reduce the minimum cash balance
requirement to $3,000,000 through the maturity of the loan on
July31, 2004. In connection with the issuance of the note,
LanVision issued Warrants to purchase 750,000 shares of Common
Stock of LanVision at $387 per share at any time through
July16, 2008. The Warrants are subject to customary
antidilution and registration rights provisions. Under the terms of the loan agreement, LanVision
has guaranteed the lender that the increase in the market value
of the stock underlying the Warrants, at the time of loan
maturity, over the exercise price plus the 12% interest paid on
the loan will yield the lender a 25% compound annual return. If
the yield from the Warrants plus interest paid does not provide
the lender with the 25% guaranteed compound annual return,
LanVision is required to pay the additional amount in cash at
the time of maturity. Accordingly, LanVision is accruing
interest on the loan at a 25% compound interest rate, regardless
of the market value of the stock and the inherent value of the
Warrants. Assuming that the Warrants have no value, the maximum
amount of the accrued and unpaid interest at maturity on
July31, 2004 will be $5,397,375, less the amount of
$1,500,000 prepayment made on March1, 2004, as discussed
above. Should the Warrant, which has a purchase price of $387
per share, have any value, then the value of the Warrant would
reduce the amount of the accrued and unpaid interest required to
be paid at maturity by such value. In addition, the founders of LanVision have
consented to certain restrictions on the sale or transfer of
their shares. Maturity of the long-term debt is as follows:
fiscal year 2004, $1,000,000. LanVision believes the fair market value of the
long-term debt and its accompanying Warrants approximates the
carrying value based on the term, interest rate and maturity
that LanVision believes is currently available to it. 42 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued LanVision was in compliance with all of the
amended terms and conditions of the loan agreement as of
January31, 2004, except for the Minimum Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes requirement at the end of the first quarter
of fiscal year 2003, which covenant was waived by the lender. During fiscal year 2002 LanVision acquired
computer equipment and related software for a new
application-hosting services data center, which are accounted
for as capitalized leases. The amount of the leased assets by
category is: computer equipment $372,705; computer software
$196,799; and prepaid maintenance and expenses $84,626, for a
total of $654,130 in new assets. The leases are payable monthly
in installments of $19,991, through August2005 and an
additional amount of $8,323, through December2005. The
present value of the future lease payments upon lease inception
was $654,130 using the interest rates implicit in the lease
agreements at the inception of the leases. The following is an analysis of the assets under
capital lease at the fiscal year end

obligations of the minimum lease payments, less the amount
representing interest of $24,811 is reflected in the balance
sheet as a current obligation of $220,199 and a non-current
obligation of $168,121. 4.Income
Taxes In 2003, 2002 and 2001, LanVision was subject to

During fiscal year 2003, LanVision determined
that a portion of the Federal net operating loss carry forward
would not be recognized totaling $2,058,394 $888,822
tax-benefit. An adjustment of $888,822 was required to record
the net operating loss carry forward deferred tax asset to the
appropriate amount. As the net operating loss carry forward had
a full valuation allowance recorded in the prior year, there was
no impact on 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued the Consolidated Statement of Income in 2003
resulting from this adjustment; however, the adjustment is a
component of the 2003 effective tax rate reconciliation. LanVision provides deferred income taxes for
temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized
for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The income tax
effects of these temporary differences are as follows

In prior years, LanVision established a full
valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax assets. As
of January31, 2004, LanVision reduced the valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets primarily related to the
carry forward by $588,000 based upon reasonable future earnings
before income tax projections. A valuation allowance of
$8,393,275 is still required to reduce the deferred tax assets,
primarily relating to loss carry forwards, to a level currently
believed will be utilized to offset future earnings before
income taxes based the current backlog and forecasts over the
next two years. The valuation allowance is required due to the
inability to predict on a longer term basis that LanVision will
more likely than not attain levels of profitability
required to utilize additional loss carry forwards. At January31, 2004, LanVision had a net
operating loss carry forward of approximately $24,000,000, which
begins to expire in 2010. LanVision also has an Alternative
Minimum Tax credit carry forward of approximately $58,000, which
has an unlimited carry forward period. Certain changes in stock
ownership can result in a limitation on the amount of net
operating loss carry forward that can be utilized each year. 5. Retirement Plan LanVision has established a 401k retirement
plan that covers substantially all employees. Company
contributions to the plan may be made at the discretion of the
Board of Directors. To date, no Company contributions have been
made to the plan. 6.Major
Customers During fiscal year 2003, three customers,
exclusive of our remarketing partners, accounted for 12%, 6 and 5% of total revenues. During fiscal year 2002, three
customers, exclusive of our remarketing partners, accounted for
12%, 8%, and 8% of total revenues. During fiscal year 2001,
three customers, exclusive of our remarketing partners,

January31, 2004 and 2003, 38% and 47%, respectively, of
LanVisions accounts receivable were due from three
customers excluding remarketing partners. At January31,
2004 and 2003 approximately, 34% and 37%, respectively, of
LanVisions accounts receivables were due from remarketing
partners. 44 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The Employee Stock Option Plan contains change of
control provisions whereby any outstanding options subject to
vesting, which have not fully vested as of the date of the
change in control, shall automatically vest and become
immediately exercisable. One of the change in control provisions
is deemed to occur if there is a change in beneficial ownership,
or authority to vote, directly or indirectly, securities
representing 20% or more of the total of all of LanVisions
then outstanding voting securities, unless through a transaction
arranged by, or consummated with the prior approval of the Board
of Directors. Other change in control provisions relate to
mergers and acquisitions or a determination of change in control
by LanVisions Board of Directors. 8.Stock Purchase
Plan LanVision has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
under which employees may purchase up to 500,000 shares of
Common Stock. Under the plan, eligible employees may elect to
contribute, through payroll 45 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued deductions, up to 10% of their base pay to a

lesser of a85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common
Stock on July1, of the prior year, or b85% of the

purchased at the price of $168 per share; 2002, 23,059 shares
were purchased at the price of $123 per share; and in 2001,
15,707 shares were purchased at the price of $123 per share. The purchase price at June30, 2004, will be
85% of the lower of athe closing price on July1,
2003 $195 or b85% of the closing price on June 30,

and Contingencies Maintenance Agreements, Warranties, and
Indemnities LanVision warrants to customers that its software
will meet certain performance requirements for an initial
limited warranty period. LanVision has maintenance agreements to
provide services in future periods after the expiration of the
initial limited warranty period. LanVision invoices customers in
accordance with the agreements and records the invoicing as
deferred revenues and recognizes the revenues ratably over the
term of the maintenance agreements. LanVisions standard
agreements with its customers usually include intellectual
property infringement indemnification provisions to indemnify
them from and against third-party claims, and for liabilities,
damages, and expenses arising out of LanVisions operation
of its business or any negligent act or omission of LanVision. Application-hosting Services LanVision enters into long-term agreements to
provide document imaging/management and workflow services to its
healthcare customers on an outsourced basis from a central data
center. LanVision guarantees specific up-time and
response time performance standards, which, if not
met may result in reduced revenues, as a penalty, for the month
in which the standards are not met. Employment Agreements LanVision has entered into employment agreements
with its officers and employees that generally provide annual
salary, a minimum bonus, discretionary bonus, stock incentive
provisions, and severance arrangements. Reserved Common Stock LanVision has reserved 1,236,031 shares of the

shares for the Warrants issued in connection with the long-term

its subsidiary. Based on a review of such litigation with legal
counsel, LanVision believes any resulting liability would not
have a material affect on LanVisions consolidated
financial position or results of operations. 46 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
