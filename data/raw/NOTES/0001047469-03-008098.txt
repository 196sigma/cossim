Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. as of December31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Millennium
Pharmaceuticals,Inc. at December31, 2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2000 the Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition and in 2002 the Company adopted
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. s/

Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002     1]The Company 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Millennium or the Company is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing products
in several disease areas. The Company currently has a product on the market in the cardiovascular disease area and a product that it hopes will soon be on the market in the cancer area. The Company
also has potential products in earlier stages of development in the inflammatory disease and metabolic disease areas. Millennium
strategy is to advance multiple products in several disease areas through clinical trials and regulatory approvals and to be involved in the marketing and sale of many of
these products. The Company plans to commercialize many of its products independently, but will seek commercial partners when it believes that it will maximize product value. 2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Basis of Presentation 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Millennium and its majority-owned subsidiaries and in 2000, other subsidiaries controlled by the
Company. The ownership of the other interest holders of the consolidated subsidiaries is reflected as minority interest. There have been no such other interest holders since June2, 2000. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. Investment in the Company unconsolidated joint venture in 2001 and 2000 is accounted for using the equity method see Note6. 
The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and corporate bonds with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Marketable securities consist of high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government agency securities. Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. Marketable securities
at December31, 2002 and 2001 are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the
unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. The cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts
to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in investment income. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on
available-for-sale securities are included in realized gain on marketable securities, net. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest
and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in investment income. 
During
the years ended December31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded realized gains of $534million and $79million, respectively, and realized losses of
$213million and $59million, respectively on marketable securities. There were no significant realized gains or losses on sales of any marketable securities in 2000.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued 
[2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
Cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two major financial institutions in the United States. Deposits with banks may exceed the amount of
insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of marketable securities. Marketable securities consist of high-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed and U.S. government agency securities.
The Company investment policy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any one type of investment, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations. Segment Information 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information SFAS
No131, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that those enterprises
report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports. SFAS No131 also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas,
and major customers. 
The
Company operates in one business segment, which primarily focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutic and diagnostic human healthcare
products and services. All of the Company copromotion revenue is currently related to sales of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection. Historically, all of the Company revenues have been
derived from its strategic alliances. Revenues from Bayer, AG Bayer accounted for approximately 22%, 39% and 27% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and
2000. Revenues from Monsanto Company Monsanto accounted for approximately 12%, 18% and 22% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Revenues from
Aventis Pharmaceuticals,Inc. Aventis accounted for approximately 12%, 16% and 10% of consolidated revenues for the years ended December31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. There were no other
significant customers in 2002, 2001, and 2000. Information Concerning Market and Source of Supply Concentration 
Millennium and Schering-PloughLtd. and Schering Corporation collectively SGP copromote INTEGRILIN in the United States and share any profits and
losses. INTEGRILIN has received regulatory approval in the European Union and a number of other countries for various indications. The Company has exclusively licensed to SGP rights to market
INTEGRILIN outside the United States, and SGP pays the Company royalties based on these sales of INTEGRILIN. The Company has long-term supply arrangements with two suppliers for the bulk
product and with another two suppliers, one of which is SGP, for the filling and final packaging of INTEGRILIN. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts reported in the Company balance sheets for other current assets and long-term debt approximate their fair value. The fair
values of the Company long-term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Company current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing
arrangements.

Inventory 
Inventory represents bulk materials used in the production of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection and INTEGRILIN finished goods inventory on hand,
valued at cost, using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory consists of the following in thousands: December 31, 2002 Bulk materials 67,102 Finished goods 38,244 105,346 Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Equipment consists principally of assets held under capitalized leases and are stated at the present value of future
minimum lease obligations. Application development costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized in accordance with Statement of Position SOP
No98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and are amortized over the shorter of the remaining
life of the building lease or useful life. Depreciation is recorded on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease as
follows: Equipment
3 to 4 years Capitalized software
3 to 5 years Leasehold improvements

Company expects to incur amortization expense of $391million, $343million, $339million, $338million and $338million for each of the years
ending December31, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. 
In
July2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, SFAS No142. Under SFAS
No142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Separable
intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. The Company adopted SFAS No142 effective January1, 2002 and
reclassified amounts to goodwill which were previously allocated to assembled workforce. Upon adoption, the Company ceased the amortization of goodwill. The Company completed its transitional
assessment of goodwill in the first quarter of 2002 and no impairment loss was recognized. The Company will test for goodwill impairment annually, on October1.

Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued 
[2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
On
October1, 2002, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined that no impairment existed on that date. However, since the date of the Company
acquisition of COR Therapeutics,Inc. COR, which generated a significant amount of goodwill see Note4, the Company has experienced a significant decline in market capitalization
due to a decline in stock price. The Company continually monitors business and market conditions to assess whether an impairment indicator exists. If the Company were to determine that an impairment
indicator exists, it would be required to perform an impairment test which might result in a material impairment charge to the statement of operations. 
The
following unaudited pro forma adjusted net losses have been prepared as if SFAS No142 had been applied retroactively: Year Ended December 31 2002
2001
2000 in thousands, except per share amounts Net loss 590,193 192,005 355,287 Add back: Goodwill amortization 57,723 49,049 Add back: Assembled workforce amortization 1,180 918 Adjusted net loss 590,193 133,102 305,320 Amounts per common share, basic and diluted Net loss 213 088 184 Add back: Goodwill amortization 026 026 Add back: Assembled workforce amortization 001 Adjusted net loss 213 061 158 Shares 277,665 218,937 192,835 Revenue Recognition 
Copromotion revenue includes the Company share of profits from the sale of INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection in copromotion territories by SGP.
Also included in copromotion revenue are reimbursements from SGP of the Company cost of copromotion revenue and royalties from SGP on sales of INTEGRILIN outside the copromotion territory. The
Company recognizes revenue when SGP ships INTEGRILIN to wholesalers and records it net of allowances, if any. The Company costs of
copromotion revenue consist of certain manufacturing-related and advertising and promotional expenses associated with the sale of INTEGRILIN within copromotion territories. The Company defers certain
manufacturing-related expenses until the time SGP ships related product to its customers inside and outside copromotion territories. Advertising and promotional expenses are expensed as incurred.
Deferred revenue includes payments from SGP received prior to the period in which the related contract revenues are earned. Deferred revenue also includes cash advances from SGP to the Company for the
Company prepayments to its manufacturers of INTEGRILIN. 
Effective
October1, 2000, Millennium changed its method of accounting for revenue under strategic alliances in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No101
SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. Previously, the Company had recognized revenue relating to non-refundable, up-front, license and milestone payments
and certain research funding 
59 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued  [2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
payments
from its strategic partners in accordance with the contract. Under the new accounting method adopted retroactively to January1, 2000, the Company recognizes revenue from
non-refundable, up-front, license and milestone payments, not specifically tied to a separate earnings process, ratably over the term of the research contract. 
When
payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process, revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation associated with the payment is completed. Performance
obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology, such as initiation of clinical trials, filing for approval with regulatory agencies and
approvals by regulatory agencies. In addition, when appropriate, the Company recognizes revenue from certain research payments based upon the level of research services performed during the period of
the research contract. 
Income Taxes 
The liability method is used to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting
and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss carryforwards, and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization. 
Net Loss Per Share 
Basic net loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is
typically computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares from stock options, warrants and convertible debt using the treasury stock method. The 2000 net
loss attributable to common stockholders is calculated by including the deduction of a deemed preferred stock dividend relating to the excess of the fair value of the Company common stock over the
carrying value of the Millennium Predictive Medicine,Inc. MPMx minority interest acquired. For the years ended December31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, diluted net loss per share is the
same as basic net loss per share, as the inclusion of outstanding common stock options, warrants and convertible debt would be antidilutive. 
Foreign Currency Translation 
The financial statements of the Company foreign subsidiary are measured using the local currency as the functional currency, with results of operations and cash
flows translated at average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities translated at end of period exchange rates. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the
results of operations and are not material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Translation adjustments are excluded from the determination of net loss and are accumulated in a separate

[2]Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Continued 
December31, 2002 is approximately $18million of realized losses from the sales of marketable securities that had been reclassified from
unrealized gains and losses to realized losses due to a decline in the market value that was deemed to be other than temporary at December31, 2001. Accumulated other comprehensive income as of
December31, 2002 and 2001 included $24million and $349million, respectively of unrealized gains on marketable securities and $17million and $05 million,
respectively, of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments. Comprehensive loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. 
Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25and related
interpretations, in accounting for its stock-based compensation plans, rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under FASB SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, SFAS No123. Under APB 25, when the exercise price of options granted under these plans equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation
expense is recognized. In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, the Company records compensation expense equal to the fair value of options granted to
non-employees over the vesting period, which is generally the period of service. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No123 to stock-based

Company has never declared cash dividends on any of its capital stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. 
The
effects on 2002, 2001 and 2000 pro forma net loss and net loss per share of expensing the estimated fair value of stock options and common shares issued pursuant to the stock option
and stock purchase plans are not necessarily representative of the effects on reported results of operations for future years as options vest over several years and the Company intends to grant
varying levels of stock options in future periods. Accounting Pronouncements 
In June2002, the FASB issued SFAS No146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, SFAS No146. SFAS
No146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is
incurred, except for one-time termination benefits that meet certain requirements. The Company was required to adopt SFAS No146 for activities that were initiated after
December31, 2002, with early application encouraged. The Company adopted SFAS No146 as of December1, 2002 in association with the discontinuation of certain discovery efforts
in December2002 See Note11. 
In
December2002, the FASB issued SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure, SFAS No148. SFAS
No148 provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation. Further, the statement requires disclosure of
comparable information for all companies regardless of whether, when, or how an entity adopts the preferable, fair value based method of accounting. These disclosures are now required for interim
periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure. SFAS No148 is effective for fiscal periods ending after December15, 2002. The Company has provided the new disclosures in

Millennium Predictive Medicine,Inc. 
In September1997, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, MPMx, to develop products and services to optimize the prevention, diagnosis,
treatment and management of disease. In 1999, MPMx entered into a strategic alliance in the diagnostic field with Becton, Dickinson and Company Becton Dickinson. In March1999, Becton
Dickinson made an equity investment in MPMx of $150million, representing approximately an 11% voting interest in MPMx, and paid a $30million licensing fee to MPMx. The minority
interest in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued  [3]Subsidiaries Continued 
accompanying
consolidated statements of operations includes the minority stockholder interest in the net income of MPMx for the year ended December31, 2000. All intercompany transactions
with this subsidiary have been eliminated in consolidation. 
On
June2, 2000, the Company acquired the outstanding preferred stock of its MPMx subsidiary that it did not already own, making MPMx a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The
transaction was a stock-for-stock merger. Under the terms of the agreement, MPMx shareholders, including Becton Dickinson, received 08 shares of Millennium common stock in
exchange for each MPMx share. The Company recorded a deemed preferred stock dividend of $457million in 2000 relating to the excess of the fair value of its common stock over the carrying
value of the MPMx minority interest acquired from Becton Dickinson. 4]COR Acquisition 
On February12, 2002, the Company acquired COR for an aggregate purchase price of $18billion primarily consisting of 551million shares of
Millennium common stock pursuant to the merger agreement between the Company and COR. Through the merger, the Company added approximately 300 new employees and a leased facility in South San
Francisco, California and acquired INTEGRILIN eptifibatide Injection for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and substantial research capabilities in the areas of cardiovascular
disease and oncology. The purchase price calculation is based on COR outstanding common stock at February12, 2002 using the conversion ratio of 09873 of a share of Millennium common stock for
each share of outstanding COR common stock. In addition, options to purchase approximately 62million shares of COR common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $1290 were assumed
by Millennium pursuant to the merger agreement and converted into options to purchase approximately 61million shares of Millennium common stock. The
total cost of the merger was determined as follows in thousands, except per share: Fair value of Millennium shares calculated using $3057 per share average fair value for the three days prior to and after announcement of the merger 1,685,334 Value of COR options assumed net of intrinsic value of unvested options 127,714 Millennium transaction costs, consisting primarily of financial advisory, legal and accounting fees 20,281 1,833,329 The
fair value of options assumed was determined using the Black-Scholes method assuming expected lives ranging from one to five years, a risk-free interest rate of 435 volatility of 8688% and no expected dividends. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No44, or FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan
Interpretation of APB 25, a portion of the intrinsic value of unvested options of COR has been allocated to deferred stock compensation. Deferred stock compensation will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated remaining vesting period of the related options, or approximately five years. The
transaction was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and the Company consolidated financial statements include COR operating results from the date of the acquisition.

purchase
price was allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values, with the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
tangible assets allocated to specific intangible assets and goodwill as follows in thousands: Net tangible assets acquired 37,585 In-process research and development 242,000 Identifiable intangible assets primarily developed technology13 year useful life and trademarkindefinite life 494,000 Goodwill 1,059,744 1,833,329 The
Company recorded a one-time, noncash charge to operations in 2002 of $2420million for acquired in-process research and development. The valuation of
acquired in-process research and development represents the estimated fair value related to incomplete projects that, at the time of the acquisition, had no alternative future use and for
which technological feasibility had not been established. 
The
income approach was used to establish the fair values of developed technology, trademark and acquired in-process research and development. This approach establishes the
fair value of an asset by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset over its useful life and then discounting these
after-tax cash flows back to a present value. The discounting process uses a rate of return commensurate with the time value of money and investment risk factors. 
The
following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations have been prepared as if the acquisition of COR had occurred as of January1, 2001: Year Ended December 31 2002

results do not purport to be indicative of results that would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented, nor do they purport to be indicative of the results that will
be obtained in the future. 5]CDC Acquisition  On July27, 2000, the Company acquired Cambridge Discovery ChemistryLtd. CDC, a subsidiary of Oxford Molecular Group, plc, for an aggregate
purchase price of $518million. The 
64

transaction
was recorded as a purchase for accounting purposes and accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair
values. The consolidated financial statements include CDC operating results from the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value of tangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated to specific intangible assets relating to contracts and goodwill. Specifically identified intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over four years. Pro forma results of operations are not presented because CDC results of operations prior to the date of acquisition are not material. 6]Revenues and Strategic Alliances 
Historically, the Company has formed strategic alliances with major participants in marketplaces where its discovery expertise and technology platform are
applicable. These agreements include alliances based on the transfer of technology platforms, alliances which combine technology transfer with a focus on a specific disease or therapeutic approach,
and disease-focused programs under which the Company conducts research funded by its partners. The Company disease-based alliances and alliances which combine technology-transfer with a disease
focus are generally structured as research collaborations. Under these arrangements, the Company performs research in a specific disease area aimed at discoveries leading to novel pharmaceutical
small molecule products. These alliances generally provide research funding over an initial period, with renewal provisions, varying by agreement. Under these agreements, the Company partners may
make up-front payments, additional payments upon the achievement of specific research and product development milestones, ongoing research funding and/or pay royalties or in some cases
profit-sharing payments to the Company based upon any product sales resulting from the collaboration. 
Effective
October1, 2000, Millennium changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with SAB 101. The cumulative effect of the change resulted in a charge
to income of $1077million in 2000 and relates to revenue previously recognized by the Company that was deferred into future periods under SAB 101. As a result, included in revenue is
$361million, $439million and $200million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of revenue that was recognized in prior years. The
remaining amount of revenue that was included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of $86million will be recognized in 2003.  Product Alliances  The Company major product alliances include a collaboration agreement with SGP to jointly develop and commercialize INTEGRILIN eptifibatide
Injection on a worldwide basis. In 2002, the Company recognized $1600million in copromotion revenue under the collaboration agreement with SGP. 
Through
its merger with LeukoSite in 1999, the Company became a party to a joint venture agreement with ILEX Products,Inc. ILEX to form Millennium and ILEX Partners, L.P.
MI for the purpose of developing and commercializing the CAMPATH alemtuzumab humanized monoclonal antibody for use in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The Company
accounted for its investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. During the years ended December31, 2001 and 2000, the Company recognized $33million and
$56million of revenue from research and development activities performed on behalf of and to be reimbursed by MI, respectively. On 
65 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued  [6]Revenues and Strategic Alliances Continued 
December31,
2001, ILEX Oncology acquired the Company equity interest in MI which owns the CAMPATH product in exchange for $200million plus additional consideration contingent upon
future sales of CAMPATH. The Company earned $400million of such consideration in 2002. The Company is entitled to receive additional payments of $400million in each of 2003 and 2004
if sales of CAMPATH in the United States meet specified thresholds. In addition, the Company may be entitled to additional payments from ILEX Oncology based on future U.S. sales of CAMPATH.  Research and Discovery Alliances  The Company has entered into research, development, technology-transfer and commercialization arrangements with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
relating to a broad range of therapeutic and predictive medicine products and services. These alliances provide Millennium with the opportunity to receive various combinations of equity investments,
license fees and research funding, and may provide certain additional payments contingent upon the achievement of research and regulatory milestones and royalties and/or share profits if the Company
collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products. 
On
March9, 2001, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Abbott Laboratories Abbott. This alliance is for a five-year term, and is a research and
development collaboration in the area of metabolic diseases. The Company and Abbott have agreed to share the cost of developing, manufacturing and marketing products on a worldwide basis. This
arrangement with Abbott also includes a technology exchange and development agreement and a $2500million equity investment agreement. As part of this $2500million equity investment
agreement, Abbott made investments in 2001 and 2002 totaling $2214million. Abbott made the remaining $286million investment in March2003. On
June22, 2000, the Company entered into an alliance with Aventis, the pharmaceutical company of Aventis S.A., covering the joint development and commercialization of drugs for
the treatment of inflammatory diseases; joint development of new drug discovery technologies; transfer of key elements of the Company technology platform to Aventis to enhance its existing
capabilities; and purchase of an equity interest in the Company by Aventis. The companies have agreed to share the responsibility for and cost of developing, marketing and manufacturing products
arising from the alliance, as well as profits in North America. Outside of North America, Aventis is responsible for developing and marketing products arising from the alliance, with a royalty
obligation to the Company. Under a Technology Transfer Agreement, the Company agreed to provide Aventis with rights to its drug discovery technologies in exchange for payments between
$1600million and $2000million over a three to five-year period, $978million of which the Company has received. Aventis has purchased $2500million of the
Company common stock as agreed under an Investment Agreement with the Company. 
In
September1998, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Bayer. In November1998, Bayer made an equity investment of $966million for approximately
198million shares of Millennium common stock. The primary goal of the alliance is for the Company to supply 225 drug targets to Bayer over a period of five years. These targets will be
identified as relevant for cardiovascular disease, areas of oncology, osteoporosis, pain, liver fibrosis, hematology and viral infections. Future anticipated payments over the full alliance term
include $2190million of ongoing research program funding, of which the Company has received approximately $1980million as of December31, 2002, as well as a 
66 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals,Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued  [6]Revenues and Strategic Alliances Continued 
potential
of up to $1160million of success fee payments for delivery of targets, of which the Company has received approximately $594million as of December31, 2002. 
In
connection with the company adoption of SAB 101, Millennium began recognizing the research funding portion of the Bayer alliance on a
percentage-of-completion basis. The percentage-of-completion is determined based upon the actual level of work performed during the period as compared
to management estimate of the total work to be performed under the alliance. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary, as experience develops or new information becomes
known. To reflect research productivity improvements, in September2001, management revised its estimate of the remaining work to be performed under the alliance. This resulted in a cumulative
favorable catch up adjustment of $184million of additional revenue in the third quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of this change in estimate, net loss attributable to common stockholders
and the related earnings per share amounts for the year ended December31, 2001 was $2104million and $096 per share. 
In
October1997, the Company entered into a technology transfer alliance through a collaborative agreement with Monsanto. Under this agreement, the Company granted to Monsanto
exclusive rights to its technologies in the field of plant agriculture, as well as a nonexclusive license to its technologies outside the plant agriculture field. The Company has agreed to collaborate
exclusively with Monsanto in the application of those technologies through the establishment of a subsidiary wholly owned by Monsanto. Monsanto paid $1180million in up-front,
licensing and technology transfer fees over the five-year term of the agreement. Monsanto also paid the Company $1000million over the five years upon the achievement of mutually
agreed-upon research objectives. Millennium may also receive royalty payments from the sale of products, if any, originating from the research conducted by the Monsanto subsidiary. In
2002, the Company research alliance and technology transfer agreement with Monsanto Company came to its original five-year conclusion. The Company may receive royalty payments in the
future if leads identified in the alliance are further developed by Monsanto into commercial products. In
2003, the research phase of the Company five-year alliance with Bayer could terminate although Bayer has an option, under certain circumstances, for an additional year.
Additionally, the Company technology transfer alliance with Aventis may end as early as July2003. The Company expects Bayer to continue to conduct research and development work on the
targets discovered in the alliance, which may result in success payments and royalties to us in the future. The Company expects the joint
development and commercialization agreement with Aventis in the field of inflammatory disease to continue through 2005.

Lease Commitments 
The Company conducts the majority of its operations in leased facilities with a combination of leased and owned equipment. At December31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, the Company has capitalized leased equipment totaling $1048million and $986million, with related accumulated amortization of $705million and
$543million. Such amounts are included in Note8. 
The
Company leases certain of its laboratory and office space under operating lease agreements with various terms and renewal options, including major facilities with lease expirations
ranging from 2003 through 2030. In addition to minimum lease commitments, these lease agreements require the Company to pay its pro rata share of property taxes and building operating expenses. 
On
August4, 2000, the Company entered into lease agreements, relating to two buildings for laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The rent obligation for the
first of these buildings began in July2002. The rent obligation for the second building is expected to commence on the earlier of aOctober1, 2003 or bthe date on
which the Company commences occupancy of the building. Each lease is for a term of seventeen years with options that permit renewals for additional periods. The Company is responsible for a portion of
the construction costs for both buildings and was deemed to be the owner during the construction period of each building under Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 97-10, The Effect of
Lessee Involvement in Asset Construction. In July2002, upon completion of the construction period, the Company recorded the lease as a capital lease. At
December31, 2002, the Company has pledged $311million of marketable securities and cash equivalents, included in restricted cash, as collateral for letters of credit
for certain leased facilities.

Rental
payments for the August4, 2000 lease still under construction is calculated on an escalating scale ranging from approximately $83million, per year, to
approximately $94million, per year. 
External Collaborations  The Company funds research efforts of various academic collaborators in connection with its research and development programs. Total future fixed commitments
under these agreements approximate $51million in 2003 and $32million in 2004. 
The
Company has also made strategic commitments to purchase debt and/or equity securities from certain of its partners. The Company may also owe its partners milestone payments and
royalties and the Company has committed to fund development costs incurred by some of its partners. Total future fixed commitments under these agreements approximate
$406million. 10]Convertible Debt 
The Company currently has the following outstanding convertible notes: 50%
convertible subordinated notes due March1, 2007, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price
equal to $3421 per share the 50% notes;
45%
convertible senior notes due June15, 2006, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price equal to
$4061 per share the 45% notes; and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December31, 2002 Continued  [10]Convertible Debt Continued  55%
convertible subordinated notes due January15, 2007, that are convertible into Millennium common stock at any time prior to maturity at a price
equal to $4207 per share the 55% notes. At
December31, 2002, the Company had an aggregate of approximately $6000million of principal of the 50% and 45% notes outstanding after the Company completed a cash
repurchase offer to the noteholders in April2002. In April2002, the Company amended the terms of these notes to add put options permitting noteholders to require the Company on
April29, 2003, to repurchase the 45% notes for cash at a price of $1,095 per $1,000 of principal amount and the 5% notes for cash at a price of $1,085 per $1,000 of principal amount,
resulting in a maximum aggregate payment obligation of $6540million. These put options on the notes are derivative instruments. SFAS No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities requires us to record all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value. The Company determined the fair value of these derivative instruments to be
$540million in the aggregate and the Company recorded a liability on the balance sheet and a non-cash charge in the quarter ended June2002. Changes in the fair value of
these derivatives would be recognized in other income expense. 
At
December31, 2002, the Company had $833million of principal of 55% notes outstanding. During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company paid
$26million in cash to certain holders of the 55% notes in order to induce the conversion of $126million of their notes into approximately 03million shares of Millennium
common stock. These cash payments were expensed during the year ended December31, 2001. Interest accrued through the date of conversion was charged to interest expense and was paid upon
conversion. 
Under
the terms of these notes, the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 55% notes on January15 and
July15 of each year, of the 50% notes on March1 and September1 of each year and of the 45% notes on June15 and December15 of each year. All required interest
payments to date have been made. 11]Restructuring 
In December2002, the Company announced the first in a series of steps to realign the Company resources to become a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical
company. The Company has discontinued certain discovery efforts, reduced headcount in the discovery group and will reallocate resources to enhance its commercial capabilities. The Company early
adopted SFAS No146 in the fourth quarter of 2002 in association with this discontinuation of certain discovery efforts. Termination benefits relate to severance packages,
out-placement services and career counseling for employees affected by the initiative.Termination benefits and other associated costs are included in restructuring on the
income statement and accrued expenses on the balance sheet at December31, 2002. The table below displays the activity and liability balance of this restructuring charge. Balance at

December31, 2002, the Company has unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15billion available to reduce federal taxable income expiring in 2004
through 2022 and $12billion available to reduce state taxable income expiring in 2003 through 2007. The Company also has federal and net state research tax credits of approximately
$788million available to offset federal and state income taxes, both of which expire beginning in 2010. Due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of the loss carryforwards
and tax credits, the Company has fully reserved these tax benefits. No income tax payments were made in 2002, 2001 and 2000. Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used
for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company deferred tax assets as of December31 are as follows in thousands: 2002

operations and differences in revenue recognition for financial accounting and tax purposes. The valuation allowance increased by $894million during 2001 due primarily to the increase in
