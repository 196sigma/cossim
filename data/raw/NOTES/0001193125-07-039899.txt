FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Managements Report on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The management of Lockheed Martin is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on estimates and judgments, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management believes the
consolidated financial statements fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Corporation. The consolidated financial statements have been audited by Ernst Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report included herein. The management of Lockheed Martin is also
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting of the Corporation as defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance, based on an
appropriate cost-benefit relationship, that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded. An environment that provides for an appropriate level of control consciousness is maintained through a comprehensive program of
management testing to identify and correct deficiencies, examinations by internal auditors, and audits by the Defense Contract Audit Agency for compliance with federal government rules and regulations applicable to contracts with the U.S.
Government. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Corporations system of internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Corporations system
of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December31, 2006. Managements assessment has been audited by Ernst Young LLP, as stated in their report included herein. Essential to the Corporations internal control system is managements dedication to the highest standards of integrity, ethics and social
responsibility. To support these standards, management has issued the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct the Code. The Code provides for a help line that employees can use to confidentially or anonymously communicate to the Corporations
ethics office complaints or concerns about accounting, internal control or auditing matters. These matters are forwarded directly to the Audit Committee of the Corporations Board of Directors. The Audit Committee, which is composed of five directors who are not members of management, has oversight responsibility for the Corporations
financial reporting process and the audits of the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. Both the independent auditors and the internal auditors meet periodically with members of the Audit Committee, with or
without management representatives present. The Audit Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  /s/ Robert J. Stevens

Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Board of Directors and Stockholders Lockheed Martin Corporation We have audited managements assessment, included in the accompanying Managements Report on the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that Lockheed Martin Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. Lockheed Martin Corporations management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporations internal control over financial reporting based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that Lockheed Martin
Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Lockheed Martin Corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006 of Lockheed Martin Corporation and our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon. /s/ Ernst Young LLP Baltimore, Maryland February 21, 2007

Report of Ernst Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, on the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements Board of Directors and Stockholders Lockheed Martin Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lockheed Martin Corporation as of December31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2006. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporations management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United
States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Lockheed Martin Corporation at December31, 2006 and 2005, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2006 the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payments. We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of Lockheed Martin Corporations internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Lockheed Martin Corporation Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 Note 1 Significant Accounting
Policies Organization Lockheed Martin Corporation is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture,
integration, operation and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products, and provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistic and information services. As a leading systems integrator, our products and
services range from electronics and information systems, including integrated net-centric solutions, to missiles, aircraft and spacecraft. We serve customers in both domestic and international defense and commercial businesses, with our principal
customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. Basis of consolidation and classifications Our consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries and other entities which we control. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. Our receivables, inventories and customer advances are primarily attributable to
long-term contracts or programs in progress for which the related operating cycles are longer than one year. In accordance with industry practice, we include these items in current assets. We have reclassified certain amounts for prior years to conform with the 2006 presentation. Use of estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States GAAP. In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions, including estimates of anticipated contract costs and revenues utilized in the earnings recognition process, that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Due to the size and nature of many of our programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is subject to a wide range of variables, including assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Our actual results
may differ from those estimates. Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original
maturities of 90 days or less. Due to the short maturity of these instruments, the carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet approximates fair value. Short-term investments Our short-term investments include marketable securities that are categorized as available-for-sale securities as defined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards FAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. We record realized gains and losses in other income and expenses. For purposes of computing realized gains and losses, we determine cost on a specific identification basis. The
fair values of our marketable securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for the respective securities. We record short-term
investments at fair value. At year end, our investment portfolio included the following:  December31 2006

Government-sponsored enterprise securities 89 88 106 105
U.S. Treasury and other securities 154 154 180 180 382 381 431 429
Approximately 68% of the securities in our portfolio had contractual maturities of one year or
less. An additional 30% of the securities had contractual maturities of one to five years, with the remainder greater than five years. Proceeds from sales of marketable securities totaled $167 million in 2006 and $461 million in 2005. Gross gains
and losses related to sales of marketable securities for both years, as well as net unrealized gains and losses at each year end, were not material. Receivables Receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers, and unbilled costs and accrued profits primarily related to revenues on long-term contracts that have been recognized for
accounting purposes but not yet billed to customers. As we recognize those revenues, we reflect appropriate amounts of customer advances, performance-based payments and progress payments as an offset to the related receivables balance. 
63 Table of Contents
Inventories We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value.
Costs on long-term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production or contract-specific facilities and equipment, allocable operating overhead, advances to suppliers and, in the case of contracts with the U.S.
Government, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Pursuant to contract provisions, agencies of the U.S. Government and certain other customers have title to, or a security interest in, inventories related to such
contracts as a result of advances, performance-based payments and progress payments. We reflect those advances and payments as an offset against the related inventory balances. We expense general and administrative expenses related to products and
services provided essentially under commercial terms and conditions as incurred. We usually determine the costs of other product and supply inventories by the first-in first-out or average cost methods. Property, plant and equipment We include property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet principally at cost. We provide for
depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets, and the straight-line method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and
equipment generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and five to 15 years for machinery and equipment. Goodwill We
evaluate goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, based on estimated future cash flows, to its carrying value including goodwill recorded by the reporting unit. If the carrying value
exceeds the fair value, we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value, and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period. Purchased intangibles, net We amortize intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations over their estimated useful lives unless
their useful lives are determined to be indefinite. For certain business combinations, the amounts we record related to purchased intangibles are determined from independent valuations. Our purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and
programs acquired and customer relationships which are amortized over periods of 15 years or less, and trade names which have indefinite lives. We included purchased intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet net of accumulated amortization of
$1,952 million and $1,788 million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Less than 10% of the unamortized balance of purchased intangibles at December 31, 2006 is composed of intangibles with indefinite lives. Amortization expense related
to these intangible assets was $164 million, $150 million, and $145 million for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and we estimate amortization expense to be $151 million in 2007, $112 million in 2008, $94 million
in 2009 and $89 million in 2010 and $80 million in 2011. Customer advances and amounts in excess of cost incurred We receive
advances, performance-based payments and progress payments from customers that may exceed costs incurred on certain contracts, including contracts with agencies of the U.S. Government. We classify such advances, other than those reflected as a
reduction of accounts receivable or inventories as discussed above, as current liabilities. Environmental matters We record
a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference
to agreements or otherwise, we project costs over a reasonable time frame not to exceed 20 years. We do not discount liabilities unless the amount and timing of future cash payments are fixed or reliably determinable. We expect to include a
substantial portion of environmental costs in sales and cost of sales pursuant to U.S. Government agreement or regulation. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record an asset for estimated future recovery
considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government. We include the portion of those costs expected to be allocated to commercial business or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under U.S.
Government contracts in cost of sales at the time the liability is established. Sales and earnings We record sales and
anticipated profits under long-term fixed-price design, development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis, generally using units-of-delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing
revenue. We include estimated contract profits in earnings in proportion to recorded sales. We record sales under certain long-term fixed-price development and production contracts which, among other factors, provide for the delivery of minimal
quantities or require a substantial level of development effort in relation to total contract value, upon achievement of performance milestones or using the cost-to-cost method of accounting where sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of
costs we incur to our estimate of total costs at completion. We record sales under development and production cost-reimbursement-type contracts as costs are incurred. We include applicable estimated profits in earnings in the proportion that
incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. We record sales of products and services provided under essentially commercial terms and conditions upon delivery and passage of title. We consider incentives or penalties related to performance on design, development and production contracts in estimating sales and profit rates, and
record them when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract 
64 Table of Contents
performance. We also consider estimates of award fees in estimating sales and profit rates based on actual awards and anticipated performance. We generally
do not recognize incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event until the event occurs. We only include amounts representing contract change orders, claims or other items in sales when they can be
reliably estimated and realization is probable. We record revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design,
development or production activities either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred, depending on the contract. This methodology is primarily used by our Information Technology Global Services
ITGS segment formerly our Information Technology Services segment. We generally record revenue under such services contracts on a straight-line basis over the period of contract performance, unless evidence suggests that the
revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern. Costs we incur under these service contracts are expensed as incurred, except that we capitalize and recognize initial set-up costs over the life of the
agreement. Incentives and award fees related to our performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable, generally at the date of award. Research and development and similar costs Costs for research and development we sponsor primarily include independent research and
development and bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services. Except for certain arrangements described below, we generally include these costs as part of the general and administrative costs that are allocated among all of
our contracts and programs in progress under U.S. Government contractual arrangements. Costs for product development initiatives we sponsor that are not otherwise allocable are charged to expense when incurred. Under some arrangements in which a
customer shares in product development costs, our portion of unreimbursed costs is generally expensed as incurred. Total independent research and development costs charged to cost of sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, including costs related to bid and
proposal efforts, totaled $1,139 million in 2006, $1,042 million in 2005 and $984 million in 2004. Costs we incur under customer-sponsored research and development programs pursuant to contracts are accounted for as sales and cost of sales under the
contract. Restructuring activities Under existing U.S. Government regulations, certain costs we incur for consolidation or
restructuring activities that we can demonstrate will result in savings in excess of the cost to implement those actions can be deferred and amortized for government contracting purposes and included as allowable costs in future pricing of our
products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government. Assets recorded at December31, 2006 and 2005 for deferred costs related to various consolidation actions were not material. Impairment of certain long-lived assets Generally, we review the carrying values of long-lived assets other than goodwill for impairment if
events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. We measure impairment by comparing the fair value based on estimated future cash flows of the related asset to its carrying value. If an
asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period. Investments in equity securities
Investments in equity securities include our ownership interests in affiliated companies that we do not control, including those where our investment represents less than a 20% ownership. When we have investments that represent a 20% to 50%
ownership interest, we generally account for them under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the affiliated companies is included in other income and expenses. We recognize
gains or losses arising from issuances of stock by wholly-owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, or by equity method investees, in the current period. These gains or losses are also included in other income and expenses. For those investments that
represent less than a 20% ownership interest, if classified as available-for-sale under FAS 115, the investments are accounted for at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected as a net after-tax amount in accumulated other comprehensive
income loss in the statement of stockholders equity. If declines in the value of investments accounted for under either the equity method or FAS 115 are determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current
period. We make such determinations by considering, among other factors, the length of time the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying value, future business prospects for the investee, and information regarding market and
industry trends for the investees business, if available. Investments not accounted for under one of these methods are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Derivative financial instruments We sometimes use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign exchange rates. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives at their fair value as either other current assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The
classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. We include adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives
that are not considered highly effective hedges in earnings. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives that we consider highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by 
65 Table of Contents
corresponding adjustments related to the fair values of the hedged items, or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss
until the hedged transaction occurs and the entire transaction is recognized in earnings. We immediately recognize changes in fair value of the ineffective portion of a hedge in earnings. We designate interest rate swap agreements as effective hedges of the fair value of debt instruments to which they relate in cases where we swap fixed
rates for variable rates, and as effective hedges of the cash flows of forecasted variable interest payments in cases where we swap variable rates for fixed rates. Our forward currency exchange contracts generally qualify as hedges of the
fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies, or as hedges of the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. At
December31, 2006, the fair value of our outstanding interest rate swap agreement was not material, and the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts outstanding, as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year, were
not material. Stock-based compensation Effective January1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123R, Share-Based Payments,
and the related SEC rules included in Staff Accounting Bulletin No107, on a modified prospective basis see Note 11. Under this method, we recognize compensation cost beginning January1, 2006 for costs related to 1all
share-based payments stock options and restricted stock awards granted before but not yet vested as of January1, 2006 based on the grant-date fair value estimated under the original provisions of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, and 2all share-based payments stock options and restricted stock units granted after December31, 2005 based on the grant-date fair value estimated under the provisions of FAS 123R. To account for the tax effects of stock based compensation, FAS 123R requires a calculation to establish the beginning pool of excess tax
benefits, or the additional paid-in capital APIC pool, available to absorb any tax deficiencies recognized after its adoption. Tax deficiencies arise when the actual tax benefit for the tax deduction for share-based compensation at the statutory
tax rate is less than the related deferred tax asset recognized in the financial statements. We have elected the alternative transition method for calculating the APIC pool as described in FAS 123R-3, Transition Election Related to Accounting
for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards. Prior to January1, 2006, we measured compensation cost for stock-based
compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations, but disclosed the pro forma effects
on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized based on the fair value-based method at the date of grant for stock options awarded consistent with the provisions of FAS 123. Reported and pro forma earnings per
share information for the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 are included in Note11. Income taxes We
periodically assess our tax filing exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we include in our consolidated financial statements our best estimate of the tax liability and interest for
those exposures where it is probable that an adjustment will be sustained. In 2004, the IRS closed its examination of our tax returns through December31, 2002. The IRS commenced its examination of our 2003 and 2004 Federal tax returns in 2005.
The audit is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007. Comprehensive income Comprehensive income consists
primarily of net earnings and the after-tax impact of the adjustment to the minimum pension liability. The remaining components include a reclassification adjustment related to the sale of an available-for-sale investment and activities related to
hedging and foreign currency translation. We generally record income taxes related to components of other comprehensive income based on a tax rate, including the effects of federal and state taxes, of 36%. The accumulated balance of $3,561 million of other comprehensive loss at December31, 2006 included $3,512 million pertaining to our postretirement
benefit plans and resulting primarily from the adoption of FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No87, 88, 106 and 132R see Note 12. The
remainder is composed of accumulated balances pertaining to available-for-sale investments and hedging and foreign currency translation activities. Recent accounting pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Interpretation No. FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which is effective January1, 2007. The
purpose of FIN 48 is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation,
which is required 
66 Table of Contents
to be reported separately as an adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings in 2007, is currently not expected to have a material impact on our
results of operation, financial position or cash flows. Effective December31, 2006, we adopted FAS 158, which requires plan sponsors
of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to recognize the funded status of their postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet, measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date
and provide additional disclosures. The effect of adopting the statement on our financial condition at December31, 2006 has been reflected in these financial statements. FAS 158 did not have an effect on prior years. The statements
provisions regarding the change in the measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable to us since we already use a measurement date of December31 for our plans. See Note 12 for additional information regarding the adoption
of FAS 158. Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions In 2006 and 2005, we completed acquisitions of the following businesses. There were no significant
acquisition activities in 2004. Year ended December31, 2006  Pacific Architects and Engineers, Inc., a provider of services to support military readiness, peacekeeping missions, nation-building activities, and disaster relief
services included in our ITGS segment;  Savi Technology, Inc., a developer of active radio frequency identification solutions included in our Integrated Systems Solutions segment Aspen Systems Corporation, an information management company that delivers a range of business process and technology solutions included in our ITGS segment ISX Corporation, a provider of military decision systems and other information technology solutions included in our Electronic Systems segment; and HMT Vehicles, a military vehicle design company included in our Electronic Systems segment. The aggregate cash paid for the 2006 acquisitions was $10 billion. The total amount paid for acquisitions, including amounts paid in 2006 related to
acquisitions completed in 2005, was $11 billion. Additional payments totaling approximately $106 million are required to be made over the next three years related to these acquisitions, with approximately one-half of that amount payable over the
next 12 months. We accounted for the acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Purchase accounting adjustments in 2006
included recording combined goodwill of $867 million, of which approximately $80 million will be amortized for tax purposes, and $209 million of other intangible assets, primarily relating to the value of contracts we acquired. The other intangible
assets are expected to be amortized over a period of seven years. These acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December31, 2006. Year ended December31, 2005  The SYTEX Group, Inc., a provider of information technology solutions and technical support services included in our ITGS segment STASYS Limited, a U.K.-based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability included in our ISS segment INSYS Group Limited, a U.K.-based diversified supplier of military communications systems, weapons systems and advanced analysis services included in our
Electronic Systems segment; and  Coherent Technologies, Inc., a supplier of high-performance, laser-based remote sensing systems included in the Space Systems segment.
The aggregate cash paid for the 2005 acquisitions, as well as for amounts paid in 2005 related to acquisitions completed
in prior periods, was $564 million. We also accounted for these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Purchase
accounting adjustments included recording combined goodwill of $559 million, of which $360 million is being amortized for tax purposes. These acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the year ended
December31, 2005.

Divestitures During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we completed the following transactions: Businesses In October 2006, we sold our ownership interests in Lockheed Khrunichev Energia International, Inc. LKEI and ILS International Launch Services, Inc.
ILS. LKEI was a joint venture we had with Russian government-owned space firms which has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial, non-Russian-origin space payloads on the Proton family of rockets. One of the joint venture partners,
Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center Khrunichev, is the manufacturer of the Proton launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services. ILS was a joint venture between LKEI and us to market Atlas and Proton launch services.
We have retained the right to market commercial Atlas launch services. In periods prior to the sale of these interests, we consolidated the results of operations of LKEI and ILS into our financial statements based on our controlling financial
interest. Contracts for Proton launch services usually required substantial advances from the customer prior to launch which were included
as a liability on our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred. If a contracted launch service was not provided, the related advance would have to be refunded to the customer by LKEI. In the event LKEI did not
refund the advance, we would have been responsible for making the payment to certain customers. Under the sale agreement, we will continue to be responsible to refund advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not
refund the advance. Due to this continuing involvement with those customers of ILS, many of the risks related to this business have not been transferred and we did not recognize this transaction as a divestiture for financial reporting purposes. We
deferred recognition of a net gain of approximately $60 million that otherwise would have been recognized on the sale of our interests in LKEI and ILS, and have continued to include the related assets and liabilities on our balance sheet. We expect
to recognize the deferred net gain upon the expiration of our responsibility to refund the advances, which we generally believe will be in 2008 based on the expected Proton launch schedule. Our ability to realize the deferred net gain is dependent
upon Khrunichev providing the contracted launch services or, in the event the launch services are not provided, ILSs ability to refund the advance. Through December31, 2006, Proton launch services provided through ILS were provided
according to contract terms. Our balance sheet at December31, 2006 included current and noncurrent assets related to LKEI and ILS totaling $265 million, and current and non current liabilities totaling $335 million, both of which will be
reduced as the launch services are provided. The assets relate primarily to advances we have made to Khrunichev for future launches, and the liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches. Land In the second and third quarters of
2006, we sold certain surplus land in California and Florida for combined proceeds of $76 million in cash. The transactions resulted in an aggregate gain, net of state income taxes, of $51 million which we recorded in other income and expenses, and
an increase in net earnings of $33 million $008 per share. Investments In the second quarter of 2005, Inmarsat completed an initial public offering IPO of 150million of its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The
IPO had the effect of diluting our ownership from 14% to 89%. Inmarsat used a portion of the proceeds to redeem certain remaining equity-related instruments held by shareholders, including us. As a result, we recognized the $42 million deferred
gain that was recorded in 2003 related to this investment. In October 2005, we sold 16million of our Inmarsat shares for $89 million, further reducing our ownership percentage to 53%. These 2005 transactions resulted in gains, net of state
income taxes, totaling $126 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $82 million $018 per share. In the first quarter of 2006, we sold 21million shares in Inmarsat plc Inmarsat for $132 million, reducing
our ownership from 53% to less than 1%. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a gain, net of state income taxes, of $127 million in other income and expenses, which increased our net earnings by $83 million $019 per share. In the first quarter of 2006, we received proceeds from the sale of the assets of Space Imaging, LLC. The transaction resulted in a gain, net of state
income taxes, of $23 million in other income and expenses, and increased net earnings by $15 million $003 per share. In the fourth
quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our interest in NeuStar, Inc. The transaction resulted in recording a gain, net of state income taxes, of $30 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $19 million $004 per
share. In the first quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our 25% interest in Intelsat, Ltd. to a private equity firm for $1875 per
share, or $752 million in total proceeds. The transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $47 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $31 million $007 per share. 
68 Table of Contents
In November 2004, a private equity firm purchased the outstanding shares of New Skies Satellites, N.V.
New Skies. We sold our shares for $148 million. The transaction resulted in a gain, net of state income taxes, of $91 million in other income and expenses, and an increase in net earnings of $59 million $013 per share. Other In 2000, we sold our Aerospace
Electronics Systems business. In connection with that sale, we established a transaction-related reserve to address an indemnity provision included in the sale agreement. The risks associated with that indemnity provision expired in 2006 and we
reversed into earnings, net of state income taxes, $29 million. This resulted in an increase in net earnings of $19 million $004 per share. United
Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed a transaction with The Boeing Company Boeing that resulted in the formation of
United Launch Alliance, LLC ULA, a joint venture which combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of our Atlas launch vehicles and Boeings Delta launch vehicles. Under the terms
of the joint venture master agreement, Atlas and Delta expendable launch vehicles will continue to be available as alternatives on individual launch missions. The joint venture is a limited liability company in which we and Boeing each own 50%. We
are accounting for our investment in ULA under the equity method of accounting. We contributed assets to ULA, and ULA assumed liabilities of our Atlas business in exchange for our 50% ownership interest. The net book value of the assets contributed
and liabilities assumed was approximately $200 million at December1, 2006, the date of closing. We accounted for the transfer at net
book value, with no gain or loss recognized. If our proportionate share of ULAs net assets exceeds the book value of our investment, we would recognize the difference ratably over the next 10 years in other income and expenses. We currently
anticipate that our 50% ownership share of ULAs net assets will exceed the book value of our investment in ULA, but that amount remains subject to adjustment based on the final working capital and value of other assets which we and Boeing
contributed to form ULA. In addition, under our agreement with Boeing, we could be required to make an additional cash contribution to ULA based on changes in the working capital of the business and other assets we contributed. Any additional
capital contribution would have the effect of increasing our investment and decreasing the difference between our investment and our share of ULAs net assets. This would decrease the amount that we would amortize and recognize in other income
and expenses in the future. We currently estimate that the amount by which our share of ULAs net assets will exceed our investment will be between $200 million and $300 million. Both we and Boeing also have agreed to provide approximately $225
million in additional funding to ULA. As of December31, 2006, we had provided $3 million of additional funding to ULA see Note 14. The formation of ULA did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial
position for 2006. As required by the joint venture master agreement, following closing of the ULA transaction, we and Boeing filed a
joint stipulation for dismissal of all claims against each other in the pending civil litigation related to a previous competition for launches under the U.S. Air Force EELV program, and to permanently close the case. On December13, 2006, the
U.S. District Court issued an order of dismissal with prejudice, dismissing all claims and counterclaims in the case see Note 14. Note 3 Earnings Per
Share We compute basic and diluted per share amounts based on net earnings for the periods presented. We use the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period to calculate basic earnings per share. Our calculation of diluted per share amounts includes the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock based on the treasury stock method in the
weighted average number of common shares. Our $10 billion of floating rate convertible debentures had a dilutive effect on our earnings
per share calculations during 2006. The debentures are convertible by holders into shares of our common stock on a contingent basis per the terms of the indenture agreement. The debentures are not convertible, unless the price of our common stock is
greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified period during a quarter, or unless certain other events occur. The conversion price was $7412 per share at December31, 2006 and is expected to change over time
as described in the indenture agreement. We have irrevocably agreed to pay only cash in lieu of common stock for the accreted principal amount of the debentures relative to our conversion obligations, but have retained the right to satisfy the
conversion obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount in cash and/or common stock. Though we have retained that right, FAS 128, Earnings Per Share, requires an assumption that shares will be used to pay the conversion obligations
in excess of the accreted principal amount, and requires that those shares be included in our calculation of weighted average common shares 
69 Table of Contents
outstanding for diluted earnings per share computations. The number of shares included in the computations for 2006 was not material, and no such shares were
included in the computations in 2005 or 2004, as the conversion obligations were not in excess of the accreted principal amount in those periods. Unless otherwise noted, we present all per share amounts cited in these financial statements on a per diluted share basis. The calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:  In millions, except per share data

and general and administrative costs charged to cost of sales from inventories totaled $20 billion, $19 billion and $19 billion, respectively.

In August 2006, we issued $1,079 million of new 615% Notes due 2036 the New Notes. The New
Notes were issued in exchange for a portion of our then outstanding debt securities listed in the following table the Old Notes, and cash consideration of $343 million. Holders also received a cash payment representing accrued and unpaid interest
on the Old Notes.  In millions

New Notes as a discount,

using the effective interest method, and recorded in interest expense. Accordingly, the New Notes are included on our balance sheet net of the unamortized
discount under the caption long-term debt, net. The expenses associated with the exchange, net of state income tax benefits, totaled $16 million and were recorded in other income and expenses. They reduced net earnings by $11 million $003 per
share. We have outstanding $10 billion in floating rate convertible debentures due in 2033. The debentures bear interest at a rate equal
to three-month LIBOR less 25 basis points, reset quarterly. The interest rate in effect at December31, 2006 was 512%. Interest on the debentures is payable quarterly through August15, 2008, after which the interest will accrue as part
of the value of the debenture and will be payable, along with the principal amount of the debenture, at maturity. The debentures are convertible by holders into shares of our common stock on a contingent basis under the circumstances discussed below
and as described in the indenture. The debentures are not convertible unless the price of our common stock is greater than or equal to 130% of the applicable conversion price for a specified period during the previous quarter, or unless certain
events occur including, among others: we call the debentures for redemption; we distribute to all holders of our common stock certain rights to purchase shares of common stock at less than market value on the trading day immediately preceding the
declaration date of the distribution; and the credit rating assigned to the debentures by either Moodys or Standard Poors is lower than Ba1 or BB+. The conversion price was $7412 per share at December31, 2006, and is expected to change over time as provided for in the indenture agreement. We adjust the conversion price when certain events occur including,
but not limited to, the following: the payment of dividends and other distributions on our common stock, payable exclusively in shares of our stock; the issuance to all holders of our common stock of rights that allow them to purchase shares of
common stock at less than market price during a specified period; distributions we make consisting exclusively of cash to all holders of our common stock, excluding any quarterly cash dividend that does not exceed $012 per share. We have irrevocably elected and agreed to pay only cash in lieu of common stock for the accreted principal amount of the debentures relative to the
conversion obligations described above. We have retained the right, however, to elect to satisfy the conversion obligations in excess of the accreted principal amount of the debentures in cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common
stock. There is no amount exceeding the accreted principal until the market price of our stock exceeds the conversion price. This occurred for the first time in 2006; accordingly, the debentures had no impact on the calculation of diluted earnings
per share prior to 2006 see Note 3. We also have the right to redeem any or all of the debentures at any time after August15, 2008. In 2006, we entered an agreement to swap variable interest rates on our $10 billion of convertible debentures with floating rates based on LIBOR for a fixed interest rate through August15, 2008. We designated the agreement as a cash
flow hedge of the forecasted LIBOR-based variable interest payments. Based on our evaluation at the inception of the hedging agreement, we expect the hedging relationship to be highly effective in achieving the offsetting cash flows attributable to
the hedged variable interest payments, resulting in a fixed net interest expense reported on the statement of earnings. We determined that the hedging relationship remained effective at December31, 2006. We adjust the fair value of the
interest rate swap agreement at each balance sheet date, with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income. At December31, 2006, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was not material. The registered holders of $300 million of 40-year debentures issued in 1996 may elect, between March1 and April1, 2008, to have their
debentures repaid on May1, 2008. At December31, 2006, we had in place a $15 billion revolving credit facility which expires
in July 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at December31, 2006. Borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based, at our option, on the Eurodollar rate or a bank defined Base
Rate. Each banks obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to, among other things, our compliance with various representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants limiting our ability and certain of our
subsidiaries to encumber assets and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio. Our scheduled long-term debt maturities for the
five years following December31, 2006 are: $34 million in 2007, $105 million in 2008; $242 million in 2009; $1 million in 2010; $1 million in 2011; and $4,401 million thereafter. These amounts do not include the $345 million unamortized
discount recorded in connection with the debt exchange in 2006. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt instruments at
December31, 2006, aggregated approximately $56 billion, compared with a carrying amount of approximately $48 billion, excluding the $345 million unamortized discount. The fair values were estimated based on quoted market prices. Unless
otherwise indicated elsewhere in the notes to the financial statements, the carrying values of our other financial instruments approximate their fair values.

Interest payments were $337 million in 2006, $356 million in 2005 and $420 million in 2004. 
Note 8 Income Taxes Our provision for
federal and foreign income taxes consisted of the following components:  In millions

2004 Federal income taxes Current 979 742 445 Deferred 73 24 58 Total federal income taxes 1,052 766 387 Foreign income taxes Current 9 25 11 Deferred 2 Total foreign income taxes 11 25 11 Total income taxes provided 1,063 791 398
State income taxes are included in our operations as general and administrative costs and, under
U.S. Government regulations, are allowable in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, a substantial portion of state income taxes is included in our sales and cost of sales. As a result, the
impact of certain transactions on our operating profit earnings before interest and taxes and other matters disclosed in these financial statements is disclosed net of state income taxes. Our total net state income tax expense was $113 million for
2006, $92 million for 2005 and $78 million for 2004. Our reconciliation of income tax expense computed using the U.S. federal statutory
income tax rate of 35% to actual income tax expense is as follows:  In millions
2006 2005 2004 Income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate 1,257 916 582 Reduction increase in tax expense from Extraterritorial income exclusion ETI benefit 63 66 40 Refund claims for additional ETI benefits 62 Tax deductible dividends 29 26 21 U.S. production activity benefit 21 19 Closure of IRS examination 144 Other, net 19 14 21 Actual income tax expense 1,063 791 398
In 2006, we recorded a tax benefit related to claims filed with the Internal Revenue Service for
additional ETI tax benefits for sales in previous years. Recognition of this benefit decreased income tax expense by $62 million $014 per share, and reduced our effective tax rate for 2006 by 17%. The reduction in income tax expense of $144
million in 2004 from the closure of an IRS examination primarily resulted from the examination of tax periods through December31, 2002. Current income taxes payable of $243 million and $71 million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.

A valuation allowance of $34 million has been provided against foreign company deferred tax assets
arising from carryforwards of unused tax benefits. U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been
provided on earnings of $82 million that have not been distributed by our non-U.S. companies at December31, 2006. Our intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings, thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance. If these earnings were
remitted, we estimate that the additional income taxes after foreign tax credits would be about $13 million. Our federal and foreign
income tax payments, net of refunds received, were $859 million in 2006, $599 million in 2005 and $363 million in 2004. Included in these amounts are tax payments and refunds related to our divestiture activities. Note 9 Other Income and Expenses, Net  In millions

Note 10 Stockholders Equity At December31, 2006, our authorized capital was composed of 15 billion shares of common stock, 50million shares of series preferred stock, and 20million shares of Series A preferred stock. Of the 423million shares
of common stock issued 
74 Table of Contents
and outstanding, 421million shares were considered outstanding for balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in trusts we
established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents under certain benefit plans. No preferred stock shares were issued and outstanding at December31, 2006. In October 2002, we announced a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 23million shares of our common stock from time-to-time.
Under the program, we have discretion to determine the number and price of the shares to be repurchased, and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation. Since the programs inception, our board of directors
has authorized an additional 85million shares for repurchase under the program. We repurchased 276million shares under the program in 2006 for $21 billion, 197million shares under the program in 2005 for $12 billion and
147million shares in 2004 for $772 million. From the inception of the program through December31, 2006, a total of 737million shares have been repurchased under the program for $46 billion. As of December31, 2006, there
were a total of 343million shares that may be repurchased in the future under the program. Note 11 Stock-Based Compensation
Effective January1, 2006, we adopted FAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, and the related SEC rules included in Staff
Accounting Bulletin No107, on a modified prospective basis. During the year ended December31, 2006, we recorded non-cash compensation cost related to stock options and restricted stock totaling $111million, which is included in
our statement of earnings in cost of sales. The net impact to earnings for the year was $70 million $016 per share. Compensation cost related to restricted stock in prior periods was not material. The above amounts approximate the incremental
impact of adopting FAS123R as compared to the application of the original provisions of FAS 123. Stock-Based Compensations Plans
We had two stock-based compensation plans in place at December31, 2006: the Lockheed Martin Amended and Restated 2003 Incentive
Performance Award Plan the Award Plan and the Lockheed Martin Directors Equity Plan the Directors Plan. Under the Award Plan, we have the right to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or stock units. Employees also may receive cash-based incentive awards. We evaluate the types and mix of stock-based incentive awards on an ongoing basis and may vary the mix based on our overall strategy
regarding compensation. Under the Award Plan, the exercise price of options to purchase common stock may not be less than 100% of the
market value of our stock on the date of grant. No award of stock options may become fully vested prior to the second anniversary of the grant, and no portion of a stock option grant may become vested in less than one year except for
15million stock options that are specifically exempted from vesting restrictions. The minimum vesting period for restricted stock or stock units payable in stock is three years. Award agreements may provide for shorter vesting periods or
vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. The Award Plan does not impose any minimum vesting periods on other types of awards. The maximum term of a stock
option or any other award is 10 years. We generally recognize compensation cost for stock options ratably over the three-year vesting
period for active, non-retirement eligible employees and over the initial one-year vesting period for active, retirement eligible employees. We have continued to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options
granted after the date of adoption of FAS 123R. We record RSAs and RSUs issued under the Award Plan based on the market value of our common stock on the date of the award. We recognize the related compensation expense over the vesting period.
Employees who earn RSAs receive the restricted shares and the related cash dividends. They may vote their shares, but may not sell or transfer shares prior to vesting. The RSAs generally vest over three to five years from the grant date. Employees
who are granted RSUs also receive dividend-equivalent cash payments; however, the shares are not issued until the RSUs vest, generally three years from the date of the award. Otherwise, the accounting treatment for RSUs is similar to the accounting
for RSAs. Under the Directors Plan, directors receive approximately 50% of their annual compensation in the form of equity-based
compensation. Each director may elect to receive his or her compensation in the form of stock units which track investment returns to changes in value of our common stock with dividends reinvested, options to purchase common stock or a combination
of the two. Under the Directors Plan, options to purchase common stock have an exercise price of not less than 100% of the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Stock options and stock units issued under the Directors Plan vest
on the first anniversary of the grant, except in certain circumstances. The maximum term of a stock option is 10 years. 
75 Table of Contents
Our stockholders have approved the Award Plan and the Directors Plan, as well as the number of shares of
our common stock authorized for issuance under these plans. At December31, 2006, we had 42million shares reserved for issuance under our stock option and award plans, of which 17million remained available for grant under the plans.
We issue new shares upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs. 2006 Activity Stock Options The following table summarizes

Stock options granted vest over three years and have 10-year terms. Exercise prices of stock
options awarded for all periods were equal to the market price of the stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December31, 2006 was $1764. In addition, the aggregate
fair value of all the stock options that vested during the year was $103 million, while the aggregate intrinsic value of all of the stock options that were exercised was $389 million. We estimate the fair value for stock options at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires us to make certain
assumptions. We estimate volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock price over the past five years. We base the average expected life on the contractual term of the stock option, historical trends in employee exercise activity and
post-vesting employment termination trends. We base the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. We estimate forfeitures at the date of grant based on
historical experience. Prior to adopting FAS 123R, we recorded forfeitures as they occurred for purposes of estimating pro forma compensation expense under FAS 123. The impact of forfeitures is not material. We used the following weighted average assumptions in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair values of stock-based compensation
awards during the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004:  2006 2005 2004 Risk-free interest rate

Summary of 2006 Activity As of December31, 2006, we had $118million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options, RSUs and RSAs. We expect that cost to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 17
years. We received cash from the exercise of stock options totaling $627 million for the year ended December31, 2006. In addition, we realized a $136 million tax benefit from the exercise of stock options during 2006. Consistent with FAS
123R, we classified $129 million of this benefit as a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows, and the balance was classified as cash from operations. We realized $69 million and $34 million of tax benefits from stock options
exercised during the years ended December31, 2005 and 2004 and presented those tax benefits as cash from operations in their entirety. 2005 and
2004 Reported and Pro Forma Results Reported and pro forma earnings per share information for the years ended December31, 2005
and 2004 are as follows. The disclosures for 2005 include $33 million $008 per share as an inception-to-date adjustment of fair value-based, pro forma compensation expense related to retirement eligible employees with outstanding and unvested
stock option awards. This adjustment reflects the service period as one year rather than the original vesting period, since our stock option award agreements allow employees to retain all stock option awards held through the initial one year vesting
date prior to retirement and to continue vesting in the award as if their employment had continued. The weighted average common shares
outstanding for both the basic and fully diluted calculations are the same as those used to compute earnings per share see Note 3.  In millions, except per share data

Note 12 Postretirement Benefit Plans Defined contribution plans We maintain a number of defined contribution plans with 401k features that cover substantially all of our
employees. Under the provisions of our 401k plans, our employees eligible contributions are matched by our established rates. Our matching obligations were $303 million in 2006, $273 million in 2005 and $259 million in 2004, the majority of
which were funded in our common stock. Our Salaried Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan with a 401k feature that includes an
ESOP. The ESOP purchased 348million shares of our common stock in 1989 with the proceeds from a $500 million note issue which we guaranteed. The final payment on our debt was made in May 2004. Our match in years prior to 2005 was partially
fulfilled with stock released from the ESOP at 22million shares per year. We recognized $56 million in compensation costs in 2004 related to the ESOP shares. Since 2005, the entire match to the Salaried Savings Plan has been fulfilled through
purchases of common stock from participant account balance reallocations or through newly issued shares. At December31, 2006, the Salaried Savings Plan held 633 million issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, all of which were
allocated to participant accounts. 
77 Table of Contents
Certain plans for hourly employees include a non-leveraged ESOP. In one such plan, the match is made,
generally at the election of the participant, in either our common stock or cash which is invested at the participants direction in one of the plans other investment options. Contributions to these plans were made through small amounts
of newly issued shares by us or cash contributed to the ESOP trust which was used by the trustee, if so elected, to purchase common stock from participant account balance reallocations or in the open market for allocation to participant accounts.
This ESOP trust held 24million issued and outstanding shares of our common stock at December31, 2006, all of which were allocated to participant accounts. Defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans Most of our employees hired on or before December31, 2005 are covered by defined benefit pension plans, and we provide
certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Non-union represented employees hired after January1, 2006 do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a new defined
contribution plan in addition to our other retirement savings plans. Those employees have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation. We have made contributions to trusts
established to pay future benefits to eligible retirees and dependents including Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trusts and 401h accounts, the assets of which will be used to pay expenses of certain retiree medical plans. We
use December31 as the measurement date. Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Net pension and net retiree medical costs for each of the years presented were based on assumptions in
effect at the end of the respective preceding year. In December 2006, we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of FAS 158,
which required us to recognize assets for all of our overfunded postretirement benefit plans and liabilities for our underfunded plans at December31, 2006, with a corresponding noncash adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of
tax, in stockholders equity. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plans assets and the projected benefit obligation PBO of the plan. The adjustment to stockholders equity represents the
net unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs which were previously netted against the plans funded status on our balance sheet in accordance with FAS 87. The adjustment also includes the elimination of the minimum pension
liability and intangible asset related to our defined benefit pension plans that had been recorded prior to its adoption. The unrecognized
amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost consistent with our historical accounting policy for amortizing those amounts. Actuarial gains and losses that arise in future
periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in those periods will be recognized as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the period they arise. Actuarial gains and losses recognized in other
comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The incremental impact
of adopting the provisions of FAS 158 on our balance sheet at December31, 2006 is presented in the following table. The adoption of FAS 158 had no effect on our statements of earnings or cash flows for the year ended December31, 2006, or
for any prior period presented, and will not affect our operating results in future periods.  BeforeadoptionofFAS 158 Adjustments Afteradoptionof FAS 158 In millions

our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans, the amount for unrecognized actuarial losses includes $316

million related to certain of our nonqualified and foreign benefit plans. The amount of unrecognized prior service cost related to those plans was not
material. The prior service cost and actuarial loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the fiscal year ended December31, 2007 is $66 million $42 million net of
tax and $214 million $137 million net of tax, respectively. The amount of unrecognized actuarial losses expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost related to our nonqualified and foreign benefit plans is $24 million. The amount
attributable to unrecognized prior service cost related to those plans was not material. No plan assets are expected to be returned to us during the fiscal year-ended December31, 2007.

The projected benefit obligations PBO for our more significant defined benefit pension plans
exceeded the fair value of the plans assets at December31, 2006 and 2005, as reflected in the table above. At
December31, 2006, prior to our adoption of FAS 158, our balance sheet included pretax additional minimum pension liabilities of $448 million related to certain of our defined benefit pension plans. At December31, 2005, the total amount
was $24 billion. These liabilities were calculated on a plan-by-plan basis, and were required if the accumulated benefit obligation ABO of the plan exceeded the fair value of the plan assets and the plans accrued pension liabilities. All

previously recorded minimum pension liabilities were eliminated upon adoption of FAS 158. The ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was approximately $25
billion at December31, 2006 and 2005. For defined benefit pension plans in which the ABO was in excess of the fair value of the
plans assets, the PBO, ABO and fair value of the plans assets were as follows:  In millions

The actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December31, 2006 and
2005 related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, as appropriate, are as follows:  BenefitObligation Assumptions 2006 2005 Discount rates
5875 5625 Rates of increase in future compensation levels
5000 5000
The increase in the discount rate from December31, 2005 to December31, 2006 resulted
in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of the Corporations defined benefit pension plans at December31, 2006 of approximately $930 million. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the net expense related to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, as appropriate, are as
follows:  Pension and PostretirementCost Assumptions 2006 2005 2004 Discount rates
5625 575 625 Expected long-term rates of return on assets
850 850 850 Rates of increase in future compensation levels
500 550 550
The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the
funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. That assumption is determined based on a number of factors, including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term asset allocation of
the plans, historical plan return data, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. 
80 Table of Contents
The medical trend rates used in measuring the postretirement benefit obligation were 110% in 2006 and
102% in 2005, and were assumed to ultimately decrease to 50% by the year 2013. An increase or decrease of one percentage point in the assumed medical trend rates would result in a change in the postretirement benefit obligation of 5% and 4 respectively, at December31, 2006, and a change in the 2006 postretirement service cost plus interest cost of 5% and 4%, respectively. The medical trend rate for 2007 is 110%. The asset allocations of our plans at December31, 2006 and 2005, by asset category, were as follows:  DefinedBenefit PensionPlans RetireeMedicalandLife InsurancePlans 2006 2005 2006 2005 Asset category Equity securities

fiduciary responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. LMIMCOs investment objectives for the assets of the defined benefit pension plans
are to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions and to meet or exceed the rate of return assumed for plan funding purposes over the long term. The investment objective for the assets of the retiree medical and life insurance
plans is to meet or exceed the rate of return assumed for the plans for funding purposes over the long term. The nature and duration of benefit obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are
considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to achieve the investment objectives. Investment policies and strategies
governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers and the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class,
investment approach and security holdings, and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due. LMIMCOs investment policies require that asset allocations of defined benefit pension plans be maintained within the following ranges:  Investment Groups

At December31, 2006, policies for the plans target an asset mix of 65% in total equity
securities and 35% in debt and other securities. Investment policies for all plans limit the use of alternative investments and
derivatives. Investment in each alternative asset class or structure e.g., real estate, private equity, hedge funds and commodities is limited to 10% of plan assets. Investments in derivatives are subject to additional limitations and
constraints. Equity securities purchased by external investment managers and included in the assets of the defined benefit pension plans
included our issued and outstanding common stock in the amounts of $7 million less than 010% of total plan assets and $11 million less than 005% of total plan assets at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Equity securities included
in the assets of the retiree medical and life insurance plans included less than $1 million less than 010% of total plan assets of our issued and outstanding common stock at both December31, 2006 and 2005. We generally refer to U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules in determining funding requirements for our pension
plans. In 2006, we made a discretionary prepayment of $594 million to 
81 Table of Contents
the defined benefit pension plans trust and $130 million to our retiree medical plans which will reduce our cash funding requirements for 2007 and
2008. In 2007, we expect to make no contributions to the defined benefit pension plans and expect to contribute $175 million to the retiree medical and life insurance plans, after giving consideration to the 2006 prepayments. The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:  In millions

As noted previously, we also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans to provide benefits in
excess of qualified plan limits. The aggregate liabilities for these plans at December31, 2006 were $641 million. The expense associated with these plans totaled $59 million in 2006, $58 million in 2005 and $61 million in 2004. We also sponsor
a small number of foreign benefit plans. The liabilities and expenses associated with these plans are not material to our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Note 13 Leases Our total rental expense under operating leases was $310 million, $324 million
and $318 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Future minimum lease commitments at December31, 2006 for all operating
leases that have a remaining term of more than one year were $11 billion $288 million in 2007, $254 million in 2008, $211 million in 2009, $153 million in 2010, $118 million in 2011 and $121 million in later years. Certain major plant facilities
and equipment are furnished by the U.S. Government under short-term or cancelable arrangements. Note 14 Legal Proceedings, Commitments and
Contingencies We are a party to or have property subject to litigation and other proceedings, including matters arising under
provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation as a whole. We cannot predict the outcome of legal proceedings
with certainty. These matters include the following items, all of which have been previously reported: On March27, 2006, we received
a subpoena issued by a grand jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The subpoena requests documents related to our application for patents issued in the United States and the United Kingdom relating to a missile
detection and warning technology. We are cooperating with the governments investigation. On February6, 2004, we submitted a
certified contract claim to the United States requesting contractual indemnity for remediation and litigation costs past and future related to our former facility in Redlands, California. We submitted the claim consistent with a claim sponsorship
agreement with The Boeing Company Boeing, executed in 2001, in Boeings role as the prime contractor on the Short Range Attack Missile SRAM program. The contract for the SRAM program, which formed a significant portion of our work at the
Redlands facility, had special contractual indemnities from the U.S. Air Force, as authorized by Public Law 85-804. On August31, 2004, the United States denied the claim. Our appeal of that decision is pending with the Armed Services Board of
Contract Appeals. On August28, 2003, the Department of Justice the DoJ filed complaints in partial intervention in two lawsuits
filed under the qui tam provisions of the Civil False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, United States ex rel. Natural Resources Defense Council, et al v. Lockheed Martin Corporation, et
al, and United States ex rel. John D. Tillson v. Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc., et al. The DoJ alleges that we committed violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant by not
properly handling, storing, 
82 Table of Contents
and transporting hazardous waste and that we violated the False Claims Act by misleading Department of Energy officials and state regulators about the nature
and extent of environmental noncompliance at the plant. We dispute the allegations and are defending against them. Nine lawsuits were
filed against us as a result of an incident in July 2003 at our aircraft parts manufacturing facility in Meridian, Mississippi, which resulted in the deaths of seven employees and the wounding of eight others. Six of the lawsuits were filed in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, and three lawsuits were filed in the Circuit Court of Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The lawsuits allege various torts, including wrongful death, intentional infliction of injury,
negligent supervision, intentional infliction of emotional distress and, in the case of the federal actions, racial or gender discrimination. The claims of all deceased and wounded employees have been settled or dismissed. Five cases remain pending
in the District Court, each of which alleges race or gender discrimination, or wrongful termination. We have filed or plan to file motions for summary judgment in all of these cases. All trials are set to begin in the second quarter of 2007.
On June10, 2003, we filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando
against Boeing and various individuals alleging that the defendants acquired and used our proprietary information during the competition for awards under the U.S. Air Forces Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle EELV programs and others in
violation of Federal and state laws. On August9, 2004, Boeing filed a six-count counterclaim. The counterclaim alleges tortious interference with business and contract, unfair and deceptive trade practices under Florida law, and false
advertising under the Lanham Act, based on our disclosure to the U.S. Air Force and the government of Boeings possession and use of our documents in the EELV and other competitions. In connection with the closing of the United Launch Alliance
transaction see Note 2, we and Boeing filed a joint motion, which the District Court approved, to dismiss all claims and counterclaims related to the matter. In 1995, Space Systems Loral filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that our series A2100, 3000, 4000, 5000 and 7000 satellites infringe a patent relating to a
method and apparatus to minimize attitude changes resulting from satellite thruster operations. We do not believe that our satellites infringe the patent. On November1, 2006, the case was dismissed, pursuant to a settlement agreement, with no
liability to Lockheed Martin. On October19, 2005, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation SpaceX filed a complaint in the U.S.
District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles alleging that we and Boeing violated Federal and California antitrust and other statutes by attempting and conspiring to eliminate competition in, and by monopolizing and
attempting to monopolize, the government EELV launch vehicle market, including through the proposed formation of the ULA joint venture. SpaceX seeks monetary damages and to enjoin creation of the ULA joint venture. We and Boeing moved to dismiss. On
February17, 2006, the District Court dismissed the first amended complaint. Space X then filed a second amended complaint. On May12, 2006, the District Court dismissed with prejudice SpaceXs second amended complaint for lack of
jurisdiction, finding that SpaceX failed to allege a case or controversy because its inability to compete in the EELV market arises from SpaceXs inability to offer a qualified launch vehicle and not from any actions by the defendants. SpaceX
has appealed the dismissal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. As described in the Environmental Matters
discussion below, we are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. As a result, we are a party to or have property subject
to various other lawsuits or proceedings involving environmental matters and remediation obligations. We have been in litigation with
certain residents of Redlands, California since 1997 before the California Superior Court for San Bernardino County regarding allegations of personal injury, property damage, and other tort claims on behalf of individuals arising from our alleged
contribution to regional groundwater contamination. On July11, 2006, the California Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiffs punitive damages claim. Proceedings in the trial court are currently stayed, but are expected to resume in
2007. Environmental matters We are involved in environmental proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil and
groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous waste and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities. At December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to
environmental matters was $475 million and $464 million, respectively. Environmental cleanup activities usually span several years, which makes estimating liabilities more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies,
assessments of the extent of contamination and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards. We consider these factors in estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions. We do not
83 Table of Contents
discount the recorded liabilities, as the timing of cash payments is not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. We have recorded assets totaling $386
million and $353 million at December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, respectively, for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our products and services for U.S. Government businesses.
In cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or
otherwise, we project costs over an appropriate time frame not to exceed 20 years. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases at this time. We also are pursuing claims for contribution to site cleanup costs
against other potentially responsible parties PRPs, including the U.S. Government. At Redlands, California, in response to
administrative orders issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, we are investigating the impact and potential remediation of regional groundwater contamination by perchlorates and chlorinated solvents and have submitted a plan
approved by the Regional Board to maintain public water supplies with respect to chlorinated solvents during the investigation. Following further study of perchlorate health effects by both the National Academy of Sciences and by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, California reaffirmed a six parts per billion ppb public health goal for perchlorates in March 2005. Although the six ppb public health goal is not a legally enforceable drinking water standard, we have developed
and are in the process of implementing a preliminary remediation plan to meet the six ppb goal in anticipation that California may institute an enforceable standard at that level. We also are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees and orders relating to soil or groundwater contamination at certain sites of
former operations, including sites in Burbank and Glendale, California and Great Neck, New York. Under the Burbank and Glendale orders, we are obligated to construct and fund the operations of soil and groundwater treatment facilities through 2018
and 2012, respectively, among other things. Responsibility for the long-term operation of the Burbank and Glendale facilities has been assumed by those localities. In addition, under an agreement related to the Burbank and Glendale remediation
activities, the U.S. Government reimburses us in an amount equal to 50% of expenditures for certain remediation activities in its capacity as a PRP under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA. 
Letters of credit and other matters We have entered into standby letter of credit agreements, surety bonds and other arrangements with
financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and/or the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. We have total outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and other arrangements
aggregating $34 billion at December31, 2006. Letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance.  Under the agreement to sell LKEI and ILS see Note 2, we will continue to be responsible to refund customer advances to certain customers if launch services are not provided and ILS does not refund the advance. The
amount we could be required to pay is expected to increase over time due to the payment of additional advances by the customers to ILS related to the specific launches we have guaranteed, and will be reduced by the occurrence of those launches. At
December31, 2006, the total amount that could be payable under the guarantees, approximating the total contract value of the guaranteed launches, was $344 million. That amount may be partially mitigated by approximately $70 million of cash we
retained that, absent any requirements to make payments under the guarantees, will be paid to the buyer over time as the launches occur. Our balance sheet at December31, 2006 included current and noncurrent assets relating to LKEI and ILS
totaling $265 million, and current and noncurrent liabilities totaling $335 million, both of which will be reduced as the launch services are provided. The assets relate primarily to advances we have made to Khrunichev for future launches, and the
liabilities relate primarily to advances we have received from customers for future launches. Any potential earnings impact resulting from our inability to realize the assets we have recorded related to LKEI and ILS would be partially mitigated by
our not recognizing the $60 million deferred net gain on the transaction. In connection with the formation of ULA see Note 2, both we
and Boeing have each committed to providing up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and $200 million in other financial support to ULA, as required. The non-capital financial support will be made in the form of a revolving credit
facility between us and ULA or guarantees of ULA financing with third parties, in either case, to the extent necessary for ULA to meet its working capital needs. We have agreed to provide this support for at least five years, and would expect to
fund our requirements with cash on hand. To satisfy our non-capital financial support commitment, we and Boeing put into place at closing a revolving credit agreement with ULA. At December31, 2006, we had made $3 million in payments under our
capital contribution commitment, and no amounts had been drawn on the revolving credit agreement. In addition, both we and Boeing have cross-indemnified ULA related to certain financial support arrangements e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds or
foreign exchange contracts provided by either party and guarantees by us and Boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ULA under certain launch service 
84 Table of Contents
contracts. We believe ULA will be able to fully perform its obligations and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross-indemnities.
Note 15 Information on Business Segments We operate in five business segments: Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Space Systems, Information Technology Global Services ITGS and Integrated Systems Solutions ISS. The name of our ITGS segment,
formerly known as Information Technology Services, was changed to better reflect the segments capabilities and service offerings following the growth experienced by our information technology and business process services businesses
and through recent acquisitions. The business segments have been organized based on the nature of the products and services they offer. In the following tables of financial data, the total of the operating results of these business segments is
reconciled, as appropriate, to the corresponding consolidated amount. With respect to the caption Operating profit, the reconciling item Unallocated Corporate expense, net includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment see
discussion below, earnings and losses from equity investments, interest income, costs for certain stock-based compensation programs including stock-based compensation costs for stock options and restricted stock as discussed in Note 11, the
effects of items not considered part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, Corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments and other miscellaneous Corporate activities. For financial data other than
Operating profit where amounts are reconciled to consolidated totals, all activities other than those pertaining to the principle business segments are included in Corporate activities. The FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes under GAAP in
accordance with FAS 87, and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards CAS, which are reflected in our business segment results. CAS is a major factor in determining our pension funding
requirements, and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts. The CAS expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, and therefore recognized in
segment net sales. The results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with CAS rules. Transactions between segments are generally negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts; however, these intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation and for
purposes of the presentation of Net sales in the related table that follows. Other accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Following is a brief description of the activities of the principal business segments:  Aeronautics Engaged in the design, research and development, systems integration, production, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military
