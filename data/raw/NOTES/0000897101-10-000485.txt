Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of 
Renaissance Learning, Inc. and subsidiaries 
We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Renaissance Learning, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at a2.
We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control
over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of the inherent
limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the
risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate. 
As described in Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. 
In our opinion, the
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Renaissance Learning, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in Internal Control 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.  s/ Deloitte Touche LLP Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Consolidation
The
consolidated financial statements include the financial results of Renaissance
Learning, Inc. Renaissance Learning and our subsidiaries collectively, the
Company. All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in
consolidation.  
2
Nature of
operations 
Renaissance
Learning, Inc. is a leading provider of technology for personalizing reading,
math, and writing practice for pre-kindergarten through senior high
pre-K-12 schools and districts. Our
products accelerate learning and improve test scores by facilitating increased
student practice of essential skills, increasing the quality, quantity, and
timeliness of performance data available to educators, helping educators
motivate students, and providing student access to low cost computing
solutions. 
Our
educational software covers a wide range of subject areas including reading,
early literacy, math, writing, vocabulary, and language acquisition. Our flagship product is Accelerated Reader, which provides
educators with information for motivating and monitoring increased
literature-based reading practice and to support instruction. Our software and service brands also
include: STAR Reading, STAR Early Literacy,
Successful Reader, Read Now Power Up!, Accelerated Math, STAR Math, MathFacts
in a Flash, and English in a
Flash. 
Our
hardware products include NEO laptop-computing
devices that run curriculum-specific software focused on skills improvement and
real-time formative assessments. The
units offer schools the ability to provide students with significantly improved
access to portable computing at a fraction of the cost of conventional personal
computers. Our 2Know! response
system allows educators to easily encourage student classroom participation and
obtain instantaneous feedback that can be used to quickly assess student
comprehension and performance.
Additionally, we sell our patented AccelScan
optical-mark card scanner, which is used primarily with Accelerated Math to automate scoring and
recordkeeping tasks. 
We
offer a full line of professional service and support solutions that integrate
with, complement, and enhance the effectiveness of, our products. Sold separately or bundled with our products
to provide a complete solution, our service offerings include professional
development and product training seminars and conferences, report and data
analysis, program evaluation, implementation coaching, remote web-based
training, software support, software installation, database conversion and
integration services and application hosting. 
We
utilize reseller channels to sell our software and hardware products.
Currently, we receive approximately 7% of our orders from resellers. 
We
have resale arrangements with various book dealers and book publishers that
sell our software products to their customers, the end-users. Resellers of our
software do not stock any product; rather they sell software subscriptions or
other electronically delivered content to their customers. We provide the
subscription software to the end-user and recognize the related revenue over
the period of the subscription. For other electronic content, we provide the
product keys to the end-user customer, which allow for immediate download and
recognize the revenue when we provide the key. 39 RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued
Some
of our hardware products are also distributed by various third-party resellers.
We recognize the revenue from hardware sales when we deliver the hardware to
these resellers. We offer only limited return and stock exchange rights to our
hardware resellers. Stock returns and exchanges are generally limited to 60
days, require the payment of a restocking fee, and must be accompanied by a new
order for at least the same dollar amount. We accrue a provision for reseller
price protection, stock returns, and exchanges when we ship the hardware to the
reseller, however, due to the terms of our agreements with our hardware
resellers and the low incidence of actual returns we have experienced, the
amount is not currently, and has not historically, been significant.

Significant
accounting policies 
aBasis
of presentation 
Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP. 
bUse
of estimates 
Preparation
of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
cRevenue
recognition 
Revenues
are recorded net of allowances for estimated returns, concessions, and bad
debts. 
Product
revenue is derived primarily from the sale of educational software and
hardware. Revenue from sales of
hardware is generally recognized when the product is shipped to the
customer. Revenue recognition from
sales of our software depends on whether the software is licensed on a
perpetual basis or as a subscription.
We recognize revenue from perpetually licensed software upon delivery to
customers. Subscription-based software
sales are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription
period. 
Service
revenue is derived primarily from: i product support services, ii professional
development and product training seminars and conferences, iii application
hosting, iv technical services, v consulting, and vi other remote
services. Product support services
included with sales of perpetually licensed software have a duration of 12
months or less and the associated revenue is recognized at the time the
software is shipped with the related costs of providing the telephone support
accrued for at the same time. Revenue
from professional development and product training seminars and conferences is
recognized when the seminar or conference is held. Revenue from other product support services and application
hosting is initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as
revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement, typically 12
months. Revenue from technical
services, consulting and other remote services is recognized as the services
are performed or on a straight-line basis over the contractual period. 
Revenue and cost of revenue from bundled
arrangements are allocated between product and services in our consolidated
statement of operations. For revenue, the basis of allocation is the relative
value of each element of the bundled arrangement when sold separately in actual
transactions with customers. Costs of sales are based on the actual cost of
delivering the products and rendering the services. 
40 RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - continued
Deferred
revenue includes i amounts invoiced for products not yet delivered and
services not yet performed, ii advance invoicing on contracts, and iii that
portion of support agreements and subscription-based product sales that has not
yet been recognized as revenue. 
dImpairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
We
evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually, or
more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be
impaired. Management uses its judgment to determine when an impairment test is
necessary. Examples of factors which could trigger an impairment review
include: i a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, ii a
significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and iii
significant adverse changes in legal factors or the business climate that
impact the value of an asset. 
Impairment
losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset
exceeds its estimated fair value. Estimating fair value may require that we
forecast future cash flows related to the asset subject to review. These
forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and services,
future market conditions, technological developments, the appropriate discount
rate, and future growth rates. Changes to these assumptions could result in an
impairment charge in future periods. 
We
performed testing of our goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31,
2009 and 2008. Our testing in 2009 indicated that there was no impairment of
our goodwill and other intangible assets. Our testing in 2008 indicated that
the goodwill and other intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of the
AlphaSmart laptop business were
impaired. See Note 4 for additional information. 
eCash
and cash equivalents
Cash
amounts on deposit at banks, money market funds, and highly liquid debt
instruments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less
are included in cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consisted
solely of cash and money market funds at December 31, 2009 and 2008. 
fInvestment
securities
Debt
securities have an original maturity of more than three months and a remaining
maturity of less than 24 months. Our investments in debt securities consist of
certificates of deposit, auction rate securities, and municipal bonds.
Municipal bonds are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized
cost. The fair value of our debt securities listed below is based on quoted
market prices. 
The
equity securities we own are held for the purpose of funding our Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan SERP, as further described in Note 10. These
equity securities are classified as trading and are therefore carried at their
current fair value based on quoted market prices. Our investments in equity
securities consist entirely of various mutual fund shares in amounts that
conform to the aggregate investment selections of the participants in the SERP. 41 RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Inventories
are carried at the lower of first-in, first-out FIFO cost or market.
Inventories primarily consist of purchased materials, which include laptop
computing devices, optical-mark card scanners, interactive response systems,
educational products, training materials, manuals, and motivational items.  
h
Advertising costs 
Advertising
costs are expensed as the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses for
2009, 2008, and 2007 were approximately $36 million, $42 million and $46
million, respectively.  
i
Property, plant and equipment 
Property,
plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their
estimated useful lives using principally the straight-line method for financial
reporting purposes. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as
incurred, and renewals and improvements that significantly extend the useful
life of an asset are added to the plant and equipment accounts. Depreciation
expense was $21 million, $28 million and $28 million for 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. 
The
estimated useful lives for property, plant, and equipment are as follows:
buildings-25 to 40 years; furniture, fixtures and office equipment-5 to 8
years; computer and production equipment-3 to 5 years; vehicles-5 years; and
leasehold improvements-the lease term.

Software development costs 
We
capitalize certain software development costs incurred after technological
feasibility is achieved. Capitalized costs are reported at the lower of
amortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalized software development costs
are amortized on a product-by-product basis using the straight-line method over
their estimated economic life, which is generally estimated to be 24 months.
Amortization begins when the products are available for general release to
customers. All other research and development expenditures are charged to
product development expense in the period incurred. When capitalized software
is fully amortized, the balance is removed from the capitalized software and
accumulated amortization accounts. Amounts capitalized were approximately $00
million, $01 million and $02 million in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.
Amortization expense of approximately $02 million, $04 million and $05
million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in cost of
sales-products in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2009
and 2008, accumulated amortization of capitalized software development costs
was $02 million and $02 million, respectively.  
k
Sales and concentration of credit risks 
We
grant trade credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business. The
majority of our customers are schools or school districts, although we do sell
some of our products through resellers. Concentrations of credit risk with
respect to trade receivables are limited due to the significant number of
customers and their geographic dispersion. In 2009, 2008, and 2007, no single
customer represented more than 10% of net sales or accounts receivable.  
l
Share-based compensation 
Restricted
shares or restricted stock units are granted to certain employees and our
directors. For employees, restricted stock awards generally vest over a period
of four years and for non-employee directors, upon termination of the
individuals tenure on our board. Restricted stock awards to employees are
expensed over the vesting period and those made to our non-employee directors
are expensed when granted see Note 11. Any tax benefit from the compensation
deduction allowed for tax purposes that are in excess of reported compensation
expense excess tax benefits is reflected in our statements of cash flow as a
financing cash flow.

m
Earnings per common share 
Basic
earnings per common share Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by
the weighted average number of common shares and participating securities
outstanding during the period. Participating securities include unvested
restricted share awards that have a nonforfeitable right to dividends or
dividend equivalents. Common shares and participating securities issued or
reacquired during the period are weighted for only the portion of the period
during which they were outstanding. 
Diluted
earnings per common share Diluted EPS has been computed based on the
weighted average number of common shares and other participating securities
outstanding, increased by the number of additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive stock option shares and
non-participating restricted share awards had been issued. 
The
computation of Diluted EPS does not assume conversion, exercise, or contingent
issuance of securities that may have an antidilutive effect on earnings per
share Antidilutive Securities. Antidilutive Securities include: i stock
options with an exercise price greater than the average market price for the
period, ii non-participating restricted stock awards with a grant price
greater than the average market price for the period, iii non-participating
restricted stock awards with unearned compensation costs attributable to future
service which exceed the average market price for the period, and iv in a
period with a loss, all stock options and non-participating restricted stock
awards. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the number of
Antidilutive Securities were approximately 603,000, 753,000 and 835,000,
respectively.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on
determining whether instruments
granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, which became effective for us at the
beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. The
new guidance requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or
unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation
of basic earnings per share. This also requires retroactive restatement of
earnings per share for all prior periods presented in the financial statements
and footnotes. Adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our
basic or diluted earnings per share.

Income taxes 
Income
Taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability based approach. Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences
on future years of temporary differences between financial and tax accounting
of revenue and expense items see Note 5. When it is anticipated that a
deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized, we are required to
record a valuation allowance against that deferred tax asset. 
In
the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying
the ultimate outcome of positions taken on income tax returns. For uncertain tax
positions, we are required to reserve all or a portion of the related tax
benefit based on our evaluation of the relevant facts, circumstances, and
information available at the reporting dates. Amounts reserved for uncertain
tax positions are not recognized into income until: i the closing of the
statute of limitations, ii a significant change in facts or circumstances
that would require a revision of the estimated amount reserved, or iii
settlement of the issue with the appropriate tax authority. See Note 6 for
additional disclosures regarding uncertain tax position.  
o
Comprehensive income loss 
Our
comprehensive income loss includes foreign currency translation adjustments,
which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the
consolidated statements of shareholders equity. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, accumulated other comprehensive income consisted entirely of foreign
currency translation adjustments, which resulted from translation of the
balance sheets of our international operations to U.S. dollars using the
exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date.  
p
Shipping and handling revenues and costs
We
include shipping and handling fees billed to customers in net sales. The related
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales.  
q
Sales, use and value added taxes 
We
do not include sales, use, value added or similar taxes billed to customers in
net sales.  
r
Product warranty and support obligations 
We
recognize expense for the estimated costs of hardware warranties and software
support at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranty,
we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical
and projected repair costs and knowledge of specific product failures if any.
The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the
product sold, but generally include technical support, parts and repair labor
over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software
warranty, we estimate the costs to provide customers with service during the
term of the support period. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the
adequacy of the recorded warranty and support liabilities and adjust the
amounts as necessary. 
Changes
in our aggregate product warranty and support obligations are shown in the
following table. Amounts expensed for and costs of providing warranty support
include amounts related to original warranties, extended service contracts, and
software subscription support.

sFair
value measurements 
Certain
of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value in our consolidated
financial statements. US GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. As
presented in the tables below, this hierarchy consists of three broad levels
with level 1 inputs having the highest priority, followed by level 2, and
lastly, level 3. Level 1 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs are other observable evidence
of fair value, such as: quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or
other market-corroborated evidence of fair value. Level 3 inputs are
unobservable evidence of fair market value, such as: a discounted cash flows
model or other pricing model. 
The
tables below provide fair value measurement information for these assets and
liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008. The carrying values of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable including income
taxes payable and accrued expenses, approximated fair value at December 31,
2009 and 2008 and accordingly those assets and liabilities are not presented in
the following tables.

4Goodwill and other intangible assets 
Under
US GAAP, goodwill is not amortized and we are required to assess goodwill
annually for impairment by applying a fair-value-based test. We performed
testing of our goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2009 and
2008. Fair values of our goodwill and other intangible assets were estimated
using the expected present value of future cash flows which rely on estimates,
judgments and assumptions see Note 3d that we believe were appropriate in
the circumstances. In 2008, we recorded a material impairment charge related to
goodwill and other intangibles. 
Our
testing in 2009 indicated that there was no impairment of our goodwill and
other intangible assets. Our testing in 2008 indicated that the goodwill and
other intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of the AlphaSmart laptop business were impaired.
In 2007 and 2006, our laptop revenues decreased due in part to difficulties in
integrating the selling operations of AlphaSmart
into our overall organization; however, we expected various strategic
initiatives would result in improved order rates and financial results for this
business in 2008 and beyond. Early results in 2008 were encouraging, but the worsening economic climate
resulted in schools and districts becoming very cautious with their spending,
causing laptop orders to decline sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008. Laptops
are generally viewed as a more discretionary purchase in times of tight school
budgets and curtailed spending. As we believe the economic problems and the
related impact on the laptop business could be relatively prolonged, we lowered
our forecast for laptop orders, which resulted in an impairment charge to
goodwill of $440 million and an impairment charge to customer relationships of
$09 million. In addition, we made a strategic decision to discontinue future
use of the AlphaSmart tradename,
which resulted in a complete write off of the tradename intangible in the
amount of $30 million.

taxes 
In
2009 the annual effective rate of our provision for income taxes was 357%
compared to -205% in 2008. Excluding the tax effect of the impairment charge
to goodwill and other intangibles, our effective rate in 2008 was 367%. Since
the write down of the AlphaSmart
goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes it did not generate a tax
benefit, which resulted in tax expense of $58 million during 2008 in spite of
the reported pre-tax loss. The tax accounting treatment of the goodwill write
down is the primary reason for the difference between the actual rate of -205%
and the 2009 effective rate.

Included

million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce our annual effective
tax rate. We have an unresolved tax
dispute with the state of Wisconsin related to our 2000-2006 tax returns for
which we believe it is reasonably possible a settlement could be reached
sometime in 2010. The actual timing of any settlement or the amount thereof is
highly uncertain. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to this
issue are approximately $07 million, inclusive of tax, interest and penalties.
We have not recognized any of the tax benefits related to the items disputed
with Wisconsin, so any settlement will decrease the balance of our unrecognized
tax benefits. Excluding the effects of the possible settlement of this tax
dispute, we do not anticipate that our total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly change during 2010. We do not anticipate being required to make any payments related
to tax positions that will have a significant adverse impact on our financial
position, results of operations or shareholders equity.

Lines of credit 
As
of December 31, 2009, we have a $150 million secured revolving line of credit
with a bank, which is available until July 1, 2010. The line of credit bears
interest at either a floating rate or a fixed rate for a period of up to 90
days based on LIBOR plus 15%. The rate
is at our option and is determined at the time of borrowing. We also have a $20 million unsecured
revolving line of credit with a bank available until April 30, 2010, which
bears interest at the prime rate less 10%.
We did not draw on the lines of credit during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

of business, leases will be renewed or replaced. Approximate rent expense for
2009, 2008, and 2007 was $17 million, $16 million and $22 million,
respectively.

Retirement plans 
In
order to provide retirement benefits for our employees, we have established a
defined contribution 401k savings plan covering all employees in the United States
who meet certain service requirements and a Supplemental Executive Retirement
Plan SERP available to senior management. 
Employees
participating in the 401k plan may elect to contribute up to 92% of their
annual pretax compensation subject to certain IRS limitations. SERP participants may elect to defer up to
20% of their annual pretax compensation to the SERP. 
50 RENAISSANCE LEARNING, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -

Vesting
and employer matching contributions are the same under both plans. Vesting of employer contributions takes
place ratably over an employees first four years of service with full vesting
of past and future employer contributions once four years of service is
reached. 
Employer
matching contributions are currently $075 for each $100 contributed by a
participant and are limited to a maximum of 45% of a participants pretax
compensation. For those employees participating in the SERP, the maximum
employer contribution is determined on a combined basis with the 401k plan.
Discretionary employer contributions may also be made to the plans. No discretionary contributions were made to
the plans in 2009, 2008, or 2007. 
SERP
participants elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and
invest their deferrals in certain mutual funds, which are nearly identical to
the investment selections offered to participants in our 401k plan. The
liability for the SERP is included in deferred compensation and other employee
benefits. The SERP is fully funded and the related investments are classified
as investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our liability for the SERP was $19 million
at December 31, 2009 and $13 million, at December 31, 2008.

We

key employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. A combined maximum of
60 million options, stock appreciation rights SARs and share awards may be
granted under the Plan. No incentive
stock options ISOs or SARs have been granted under the Plan. At December 31, 2009, there were
approximately 19 million shares available for issuance under the Plan. 
During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized approximately $15 million in
share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we
recognized compensation expense of approximately $14 million related to
restricted stock. Cash received from
stock option exercises was $0 in 2009 and approximately $262,000 in 2008. The total income tax benefit related to
share-based compensation, which is recorded in additional paid-in capital, was
approximately $34,000 and $113,000 for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. 
a
Stock option awards - Options
granted under the Plan may be in the form of nonqualified stock options
NSOs or, ISOs, which comply with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code.
The exercise price of the options is the market value of our common stock at
the date of grant. Options become
exercisable ratably over their respective vesting period, which ranges from
immediate vesting up to a four-year vesting period. The options expire 10 years
from the grant date. 
We
did not grant any stock options during 2009 or 2008. The weighted average grant
date fair value per share of options granted during 2007 was $1237. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised during the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $0, $25,857, and

b Restricted
stock awards Restricted
shares or restricted stock units Restricted Stock Awards are granted to
certain employees and our non-employee directors. For employees, Restricted
Stock Awards generally vest over a period of four years and for non-employee
directors, upon termination of the individuals tenure on our board. Restricted Stock Awards to
employees are expensed over the vesting period, and those made to our
non-employee directors are expensed when granted. Unearned restricted stock
compensation is recorded based on the market price on the grant date and is
expensed equally over the vesting period. 
The weighted
average grant date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards granted during 2009,
2008 and 2007 was $937, $1233, and $1293 respectively. The weighted average
vest date fair value of Restricted Stock Awards vested during the years ended
2009, 2008, and 2007 was $1129, $1318, and $1266, respectively.

On
April 17, 2002, our Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program, which
provides for the repurchase of up to 50 million shares of our common stock. On
February 9, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an
additional 30 million shares under the stock repurchase program. On February
6, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 10
million shares under the stock repurchase program. 
No
time limit was placed on the duration of the repurchase program, nor is there
any dollar limit on the program. We repurchase shares on the open market as
well as from employees who elect to surrender shares at the time of vesting to
pay their payroll withholding taxes. Repurchased shares will become treasury
shares and may be used for equity compensation plans, stock-based employee
benefit plans and for other general corporate purposes. Since initial
authorization was granted, we have repurchased approximately 78 million shares
of common stock at a cost of $1352 million under this repurchase program.

and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized common stock
of the Company from 500 million shares to 1500 million shares with a $01 par
value per share. The Companys Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation
also includes authorization to issue up to 50 million shares of preferred stock
with a $01 par value per share. No preferred stock has been issued.

Segment information
We
determine our operating segments based on the information used by our executive
officers to allocate resources and assess performance. As a result of certain
operational changes, the Company determined in the fourth quarter 2009 that it
had two reportable segments instead of one as previously reported. Prior
periods have been restated to show the results of the two reportable segments.
Gross profit is the primary measurement our executive officers use to assess
segment performance. Our reportable segments are:  
Educational Software and Services. This
segment derives its revenue from our software products; services related to
our software such as product support, professional development, hosting, and
other technical services; scanners sold for use with our math software; our
reading intervention products; and various classroom resources such as
printed materials and motivational items. 
Educational Hardware. This segment
derives its revenue from our laptops, classroom response systems, and
services such as professional development, and extended support plans sold in
connection with these hardware products. 
The
accounting polices of the segments are the same as those described in Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies. There
are no intercompany transactions between the segments. All segment revenues are
with external customers. International revenues and operations are not
significant at this time. We do not segregate assets by segments in assessing
segment performance since substantially all assets are multi-use and shared
between the two segments. Depreciation and amortization included in segment
gross profit is not material.

The
following table sets forth unaudited consolidated income statement data for
each quarter of the last two fiscal years. This unaudited quarterly financial
information is prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented
in the consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, reflects all
adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair
presentation of the information. The operating results for any quarter are not
necessarily indicative of results for future periods.

Recent accounting pronouncements 
In
October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued an
amendment to its previously released guidance on revenue arrangements with
multiple deliverables. The amendment becomes effective at the beginning of our
2011 fiscal year; however, early adoption is permitted. The pronouncement
addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple
deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement
consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. The
pronouncement may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or
materially modified arrangements. The company is currently assessing the impact
the adoption of this guidance will have on the companys consolidated financial
statements. 
In
October 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance
on revenue arrangements for tangible
products that include software elements. The
amendment becomes effective at
the beginning of our 2011 fiscal year; however, early adoption is permitted.
The pronouncement removes tangible products from the scope of the software
revenue guidance if the products contain both software and non-software
components that function together to deliver a products essential
functionality and provides guidance on determining whether software
deliverables in an arrangement that includes a tangible product are within the
scope of the software revenue guidance. The pronouncement may be applied
retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements.
The company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this guidance
will have on the companys consolidated financial statements. 
In
June 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on
determining whether instruments
granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities, which became effective for us at the
beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. The
new guidance requires that unvested share-based payment awards that contain
nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or
unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation
of basic earnings per share. This also requires retroactive restatement of
earnings per share for all prior periods presented in the financial statements
and footnotes. Adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our
basic or diluted earnings per share. 
In
April 2008, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance on
determination of the useful life
of intangible assets, which
became effective for us at the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. The new guidance generally requires the use of a consistent useful life for
an intangible asset when computing amortization, for the period of expected
cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the asset, and for other
accounting purposes. Adoption of this amendment did not affect our consolidated
financial statements. 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance
on business combinations, which became effective for us at the beginning of our
2009 fiscal year. The statement retains the purchase method of accounting for
acquisitions, but requires a number of changes, including changes in the way
assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting. It also changes
the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from
contingencies, requires the capitalization of in-process research and
development at fair value, and requires the expensing of acquisition-related
costs as incurred. Adoption of this amendment did not affect our consolidated
financial statements. 
In
December 2007, the FASB issued an amendment to its previously released guidance
on noncontrolling interests in
consolidated financial statements, which
became effective for us at the beginning of our 2009 fiscal year. This will
change the accounting and reporting for minority interests, which will be
recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of
equity. This new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting
for transactions with minority interest holders. Adoption of this amendment did
not materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
