REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Arbor Software Corporation
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Arbor Software Corporation and its subsidiary at March 31, 1996 and
1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended March 31, 1996, in conformity with generally
accepted  accounting  principles.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance  about whether the financial  statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

ARBOR SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
THE COMPANY
Arbor Software Corporation the Company develops, markets and supports
client/server multidimensional database software for business planning and
analysis. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in April 1991 and commenced
operations on that date.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and  its wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company total revenues are derived from license revenues for its
Essbase software as well as software maintenance and support, training and
consulting revenues from Essbase licensees. Revenues for maintenance and support
services, training and consulting are charged separately from the license of
Essbase. License revenues are recognized upon shipment of the product if no
significant vendor obligations remain, payment is due within 90 days, and
collection of the resulting receivable is probable. In instances where a
significant vendor obligation exists, revenue recognition is delayed until the
obligation has been satisfied. Allowances for estimated future returns, which to
date have been immaterial, are provided upon shipment. Maintenance and support
revenues, including the element of licensing fees attributable to the initial
warranty period, consist of ongoing support and product updates and are
recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically twelve
months. Revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services
are performed. The Company has recognized revenue, for all periods presented, in
accordance with Statement  of Position 91-1  entitled Software  Revenue
Recognition.
The Company entered into an agreement in December 1993 with an indirect
channel partner which provides the indirect channel partner the right to
sublicense certain of the Company products. Under the agreement the indirect
channel partner provides the Company with a summary of royalties earned 45 days
after the end of each calendar quarter. Royalty revenues generated under this
agreement are recorded in that subsequent quarter due to the 45 day delay before
the Company receives the summary of royalties earned and since currently such
royalty revenues are not reasonably estimable prior thereto due, in part, to the
limited history of this agreement. Such royalty revenues for the quarters ended
March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 1995 totaled approximately
$1,300,000,  $1,600,000, $1,650,000 and $2,066,000 respectively, and were
recorded by the Company during the quarters ended June 30, September 30 and
December 31, 1995 and March 31, 1996, respectively. Royalty revenues for the
quarter ended March 31, 1996 were approximately $2,400,000 and will be recorded
by the Company during the quarter ending June 30, 1996.
CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
The Company invests certain of its excess cash in debt instruments of
financial institutions. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased are considered to be cash equivalents and those
with maturities greater than three months are considered short-term investments.
The Company has classified all short-term investments as available-for-sale.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company limits the amount of
credit exposure to any one financial institution. Accounts receivable are
derived from revenues earned from customers primarily located in the U.S. and
Europe.
26
ARBOR SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally
requires no collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit
losses and historically such losses have been immaterial. One customer accounted
for 26% of total revenues in both fiscal 1996 and 1995. No customer accounted
for more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal 1994.
Revenues from international customers, primarily in Europe, were 9%, 5% and
12% of total revenues in fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
At March 31, 1996, outstanding receivables from one customer represented 16%
of gross accounts receivable. At March 31, 1995, no single customer accounted
for more than 10% of outstanding accounts receivable.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at
cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally three years, or the life of the lease,
whichever is shorter.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Software development costs are included in research and development and are
expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 FAS
86 requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once
technological feasibility is established, which the Company defines as the
completion of a working model. The capitalized cost is then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. To date, the
period between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability
of such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for
capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not
capitalized any software development costs.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax
basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws.
FOREIGN CURRENCY
The functional currency of the United Kingdom subsidiary is the local
currency. The balance sheet accounts are translated into United States dollars
at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Revenues, costs and
expenses are translated into United States dollars at average rates for the
periods. Gains and losses resulting from translation are accumulated as a
component of stockholders' equity. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign
exchange transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations
and were not significant during any of the periods presented.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common
and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent
shares consist of convertible preferred stock using the if converted method
and stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method. Common
equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is
antidilutive, except that, pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin, convertible preferred stock using the if converted
method and common equivalent shares

ARBOR SOFTWARE CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
NOTE 1 -- THE COMPANY AND A SUMMARY OF ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
CONTINUED
using the treasury stock method and the initial public offering price issued
subsequent to March 31, 1994 through November 6, 1995 have been included in the
computation  as if they  were outstanding for  all periods through the
effectiveness of the Company initial public offering. Earnings per share prior
to fiscal 1995 have not been presented since such amounts are not deemed
meaningful due to the significant change in the Company capital structure that
occurred in connection with its initial public offering.
MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
NOTE 2 -- INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING
In November 1995, the Company completed its initial public offering and
issued 1,880,000 shares of its common stock to the public at a price of $1700
per share. The Company received approximately $287 million of cash, net of
underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. Simultaneously,
each outstanding share of convertible preferred stock was  automatically
converted into one and one-half shares of common stock. See Note 6.
NOTE 3 -- SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
As of March 31, 1996, the Company short-term investments consisted
primarily of medium term notes, corporate notes and market auction preferred
stocks and their cost approximated fair value. As of March 31, 1995, the
Company short-term investments consisted of a certificate of deposit and the
cost approximated fair value.

NOTE 5 -- BANK LINE OF CREDIT
In September 1995, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with
a bank. The credit agreement provides for working capital advances of up to
$3,000,000. Borrowings under the line of credit are limited to specified
percentages of eligible  accounts receivable and  are collateralized  by
substantially all of the assets of the Company. Interest on borrowings is set at
the bank prime rate, plus 05% 875% at March 31, 1996. Among other
provisions, the Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants. In
addition, payment of cash dividends is prohibited without the bank consent.
The line of credit agreement expires in July 1996. As of March 31, 1996, there
were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit.
NOTE 6 -- CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK WARRANT
PREFERRED STOCK
At  March 31, 1996, the Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares of
undesignated preferred stock. Prior to completion of the Company initial
public offering, the Company had authorized 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
of which 2,065,000 shares had been designated Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock Series A, 960,000 shares had been designated Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock Series B and 904,636 shares had been designated Series C
Convertible Preferred Stock Series C collectively Preferred Shares.
Holders  of Series A, B and C were entitled to receive noncumulative,
preferential dividends of $010, $0275 and $034, respectively, per annum, when
and if declared by the Board of Directors. No such dividends were declared. Each
outstanding share of preferred stock was converted into one and one-half shares
of common stock upon the completion of the Company initial public offering.
PREFERRED STOCK WARRANT
In August 1991 the Company issued a warrant to purchase 25,000 Series A
Convertible Preferred Shares to a company for providing equipment lease
financing the Warrant. The Warrant enabled the holder to purchase 25,000
Series A Preferred Shares at $100 per share, subject to adjustment for
dilution, and each share of preferred stock was convertible into one and one
half shares of common stock. The Warrant was to expire on the earlier of August
2001 or five years following the Company initial public offering. The Warrant
had nominal value on the date of issuance. The warrant was exercised in
conjunction with the Company initial public offering. The Company issued
36,029 shares of common stock upon the net exercise and simultaneous conversion
of the warrant from preferred stock to common stock.
NOTE 7 -- COMMON STOCK, STOCK OPTION PLAN AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
COMMON STOCK
Under certain events, the Company has the right to repurchase, at the
original issue price, a declining percentage of certain of the common shares
issued to employees under written agreements with such employees. The Company
right to repurchase such stock declines on a percentage basis based on the
length of the employees' continual employment with the Company. At March 31,
1996, 266,381 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company.
STOCK OPTION PLAN
In August 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted, and  the
stockholders subsequently approved, the 1995 Stock Option/Stock Issuance Plan
the 1995 Plan. The 1995 Plan is intended to serve as the successor equity
incentive program to the Company 1992 Stock Option Plan the Predecessor
Plan. Outstanding options under the Predecessor Plan were incorporated into
the 1995 Plan upon effectiveness of the initial public offering. No further
option grants were made under
29

NOTE 7 -- COMMON STOCK, STOCK OPTION PLAN AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE
PLAN CONTINUED
the Predecessor Plan. The incorporated options will continue to be governed by
their existing terms which are essentially the same as options granted under the
Discretionary Option Grant Program described below.
The  1995 Plan is  divided into four  separate components: i the
Discretionary Option Grant Program; ii the Stock Issuance Program; iii the
Salary Investment Option Grant Program; and iv the Automatic Option Grant
Program. The 1995 Plan will terminate on September 30, 2005, unless terminated
earlier by the Board.
Options granted under the Discretionary Option Grant Program are for periods
not to exceed ten years, and must be issued at prices not less than 100% and
85%, for incentive and nonqualified stock options, respectively, of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of grant. Incentive stock options granted
to stockholders who own greater than 10% of the outstanding stock are for
periods not to exceed five years and must be issued at prices not less than 110%
of the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options granted
under the Discretionary Option Grant Program are exercisable at the date of
grant and are subject to repurchase by the Company at the option exercise price
paid per share with such repurchase right lapsing with respect to 25% one year
after the date of grant and ratably each month over the remaining thirty-six
month period. The Discretionary Option Grant Program also provides for the grant
of stock appreciation rights. Stock appreciation rights provide the holders with
the election to surrender their outstanding options for an appreciation
distribution from the Company equal to the excess of the fair market value of
the vested shares of common stock subject to each surrendered option over the
aggregate  exercise price  payable for  those shares.  Such appreciation
distribution may be made in cash or in shares of common stock. No stock
appreciation rights had been granted under the 1995 Plan as of March 31, 1996.
Under the Stock Issuance Program individuals may be issued shares of common
stock directly through the purchase of shares at a price per share not less than
85% of the fair market value at the time of issuance or as a fully paid bonus
for services rendered to the Company. No shares had been issued under the Stock
Issuance Program as of March 31, 1996.
Under the Salary Investment Option Grant Program, each executive officer of
the Company may elect, prior to the start of a calendar year, to reduce his or
her base salary for that calendar year by a designated multiple of 1%, subject
to a maximum dollar amount. In return the officer will automatically be granted,
on the first trading day in the calendar year for which the salary reduction is
in effect, a non-statutory option to purchase that number of shares of common
stock determined by dividing the salary reduction amount by two-thirds of the
fair market value per share of common stock on the date of grant. The option
will be exercisable at a price per share equal to one-third of the fair market
value of the option shares on the date of grant. As a result, the total spread
on the option shares at the time of grant will be equal to the salary reduction
amount. The option will vest in a series of twelve equal monthly installments
over the calendar year for which the salary reduction is in effect. No executive
officer of the Company had elected to participate in the Salary Investment
Option Grant Program as of March 31, 1996.
Under the Automatic Option Grant Program, each individual who first becomes
a non-employee Board member will receive an option grant for 20,000 shares of
common stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date he or she joins
the Board, provided such individual has not otherwise been in the prior employ
of the Company. In addition, at each Annual Stockholder Meeting, beginning with
the 1996 Annual Meeting, each individual who is to continue to serve as a
non-employee Board member after the meeting will receive on option grant to
purchase an additional 5,000 shares of common stock at the fair market value of
the  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  provided  such  individual  has

PLAN CONTINUED
served on the Board for at least six months. Each automatic option will have a
term of ten years, subject to earlier termination following the optionee
cessation  of Board service. Each  automatic option will be immediately
exercisable for all option shares; however, any shares purchased upon exercise
of the option will be subject to repurchase by the Company, at the option
exercise price paid per share, should the optionee cease service on the Board
prior to vesting in those shares. The initial 20,000 share grant will vest in a
series of four successive equal annual installments over the optionee period
of Board service measured from the grant date. Each additional 5,000 share grant
will vest upon the optionee completion of one year of Board service measured
from the grant date.
During fiscal 1996, the Company granted certain options for the purchase of
common stock on which the Company will amortize approximately $212,000 of
compensation expense over the four-year vesting period of the options. As of
March 31, 1996, the Company had expensed $24,000 of compensation expense related
to these options.
A summary of the activity under the stock option plans is as follows:

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In August 1995, the Company Board of Directors adopted the 1995 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan and reserved 150,000 shares of common
stock for issuance to eligible employees. The Purchase Plan permits eligible
employees to purchase common stock through periodic payroll deductions of up to
10% of their annual compensation. Each offering period will have a maximum
duration of 24 months and shares of common stock will be purchased for each
participant at semi-annual intervals during each offering period. The price at
which the common stock is purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 85% of
the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the participant
entry date into the offering period or the fair market value on the semi-annual
purchase date.

NOTE 8 -- INCOME TAXES CONTINUED
Net deferred tax assets of $900,000 at March 31, 1996 are based on the
Company carryback capacity. Management believes, based upon a number of
factors, that the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty
regarding the realizability of the remainder of the deferred tax assets and has
recorded a valuation allowance against these assets. Such factors include the
lack of a significant history of material profits, recent increases in expense
levels to support the Company growth, the fact that the market in which the
Company operates is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing
technology, the materiality of revenues from indirect channel partners and the
uncertainty regarding market acceptance of new versions of the Company Essbase
software.
