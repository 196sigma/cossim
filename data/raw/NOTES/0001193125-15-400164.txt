CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Shareholders, Audit Committee and Board of Directors 
Sonic Foundry, Inc. and Subsidiaries Madison, WI 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sonic Foundry, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company as of September30, 2015
and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material
misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of its internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as
evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sonic Foundry, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of September30, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and
cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. /s/ Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
Business Sonic Foundry, Inc.
the Company is in the business of providing enterprise solutions and services for the web communications market. Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Sonic Foundry Media
Systems, Inc., MediaMission B.V. formerly Media Mission Holding B.V. and Mediasite KK. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
Prior to January 2014, the Company owned approximately 26% of Mediasite KK and accounted for its investment under the equity method of accounting. On
January14, 2014, the Company purchased the remaining 74% of Mediasite KK. Reclassifications 
Reclassifications have been made to the September30, 2014 financial statements to conform to the September30, 2015 presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on the Companys net loss or stockholders equity as previously reported. Use of Estimates 
In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP, management is required
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense
during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition 
General Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is deferred when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of
delivered products, customer acceptance is uncertain, significant obligations remain, or the fair value of undelivered elements is unknown. Typically, the Company does not offer customers the right to return product, other than for exchange or
repair pursuant to a warranty or stock rotation. The Companys policy is to reduce revenue if it incurs an obligation for price rebates or other such programs during the period the obligation is reasonably estimated to occur. The following
policies apply to the Companys major categories of revenue transactions. Products 
Products are considered delivered, and revenue is recognized, when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer or upon customer acceptance if
non-delivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products. Under the terms and conditions of the sale, this occurs at the time of shipment to the customer. Product revenue currently represents sales of our Mediasite
recorder and Mediasite related products such as our server software and other software licenses. If a license is time-based, the revenue is recognized over the term of the license agreement.

Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
Services The
Company sells support and content hosting contracts to our customers, typically one year in length, and records the related revenue ratably over the contractual period. Our support contracts cover phone and electronic technical support availability
over and above the level provided by our distributors, software upgrades on a when and if available basis, advance hardware replacement and an extension of the standard hardware warranty from 90 days to one year. The manufacturers the Company
contracts with to build the units provide a limited one-year warranty on the hardware. The Company also sells installation, training, event webcasting, and customer content hosting services. Revenue for those services is recognized when performed in
the case of installation, training and event webcasting services. Occasionally, the Company will sell customization services to enhance the server software. Revenue from those services is recognized when performed, if perfunctory, or under contract
accounting. Service amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. 
Revenue Arrangements that Include Multiple Elements Sales of
software, with or without installation, training, and post customer support fall within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules. Under the software revenue recognition rules, the fee from a multiple-deliverable arrangement is allocated
to each of the undelivered elements based upon vendor-specific objective evidence VSOE, which is limited to the price charged when the same deliverable is sold separately, with the residual value from the arrangement allocated to the delivered
element. The portion of the fee that is allocated to each deliverable is then recognized as revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition are met with respect to that deliverable. If VSOE does not exist for all of the undelivered elements, then
all revenue from the arrangement is typically deferred until all elements have been delivered to the customer. In the case of the Companys hardware
products with embedded software, the Company has determined that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality, and therefore, the revenue from the sale of these products is accounted
for under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products whereby the fee from a multiple-deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling-price hierarchy. A
deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. A delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other
undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting. The selling price used for each deliverable is based upon VSOE if available, from third-party evidence TPE if VSOE is
not available, and best estimate of selling price ESP if neither VSOE nor TPE are available. TPE is the price of the Companys or any competitors largely interchangeable products or services in stand-alone sales to similarly situated
customers. ESP is the price at which the Company would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis, considering market conditions and entity-specific factors. All revenue arrangements, excluding the sale of all
software-only products and associated services, have been accounted for under this guidance. The selling prices used in the relative selling price
allocation method are as follows: 1the Companys products and services are based upon VSOE and 2hardware products with embedded software, for which VSOE does not exist, are based upon ESP. The Company does not believe TPE exists
for any of these products and services because they are differentiated from competing products and services in terms of functionality and performance and there are no competing products or services that are largely interchangeable. Management
establishes ESP for hardware products with embedded software using a cost plus margin approach with consideration for market conditions, such as the impact of competition and geographic considerations, and entity-specific factors, such as the cost
of the product and the Companys profit objectives. Management believes that ESP is reflective of reasonable pricing of that deliverable as if priced on a stand-alone basis. When a sales transaction includes deliverables that are divided
between Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 605 and ASC Subtopic 985-605, the Company allocates the selling price using the relative selling price method whereas value is allocated using an ESP for software developed using a percent of
list price approach. The other deliverables are valued using ESP or VSOE as previously discussed.

Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
While the pricing model, currently in use, captures all critical variables, unforeseen changes due to
external market forces may result in a revision of the inputs. These modifications may result in the consideration allocation differing from the one presently in use. Absent a significant change in the pricing inputs or the way in which the industry
structures its transactions, future changes in the pricing model are not expected to materially affect our allocation of arrangement consideration. 
Management has established VSOE for hosting services. Billings for hosting are spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement, with the typical hosting
agreement having a term of 12 months, with renewal on an annual basis. The Company sells most hosting contracts without the inclusion of products. When the hosting arrangement is sold in conjunction with product, the product revenue is recognized
immediately while the remaining hosting revenue is spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement. The selling price is allocated between these elements using the relative selling price method. The Company uses ESP for development of the
selling price for hardware products with embedded software. The Company also offers hosting services bundled with events services. The Company uses VSOE
to establish relative selling prices for its events services. The Company recognizes events revenue when the event takes place and recognizes the hosting revenue over the term of the hosting agreement. The total amount of the arrangement is
allocated to each element based on the relative selling price method. Reserves 
The Company reserves for stock rotations, price adjustments, rebates, and sales incentives to reduce revenue and accounts receivable for these and other
credits granted to customers. Such reserves are recorded at the time of sale and are calculated based on historical information such as rates of product stock rotations and the specific terms of sales programs, taking into account any other known
information about likely customer behavior. If actual customer behavior differs from our expectations, it may compromise our ability to recognize revenue to these distributors at the time of shipment. Also, if the Company determines that it can no
longer accurately estimate amounts for stock rotations and sales incentives, the Company would not be able to recognize revenue until resellers sell the inventory to the final end user. 
Shipping and Handling The Companys shipping and handling
costs billed to customers are included in other revenue. Costs related to shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue and are recorded at the time of shipment to the customer. 
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties 
As of September30, 2015, of the $20 million in cash and cash equivalents, $106 thousand is deposited with two major U.S. financial institutions. At
times, deposits in these institutions exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts and believes that it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on these balances. The
remaining $19 million of cash and cash equivalents is held by our foreign subsidiaries in financial institutions in Japan and the Netherlands and held in their local currency. The cash held in foreign financial institutions is not guaranteed. 
We assess the realization of our receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition. Through these evaluations,
we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability, credit ratings or bankruptcy.Our reserve requirements are based on the best facts available
to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received.Our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories.These percentages are determined by a
variety of factors including, but not limited to, current economic trends, historical payment and bad debt write-off experience.Allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable was $150,000 at September30, 2015 and
September30, 2014, respectively. 
52 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
We had billings for Mediasite product and support services as a percentage of total billings to one
distributor of approximately 10% in 2015 and 15% in 2014 and to a second distributor of approximately 14% in 2015 and 15% in 2014. At September30, 2015 and 2014, these two distributors represented 24% and 47% of total accounts receivable,
respectively. Currently all of our product inventory purchases are from one third-party contract manufacturer. Although we believe there are multiple
sources of supply from other contract manufacturers as well as multiple suppliers of component parts required by the contract manufacturers, a disruption of supply of component parts or completed products, even if short term, would have a material
negative impact on our revenues. At September30, 2015 and 2014, this supplier represented 49% and 27%, respectively, of total accounts payable. We also license technology from third parties that is embedded in our software. We believe there
are alternative sources of similar licensed technology from other third parties that we could also embed in our software, although it could create potential programming related issues that might require engineering resources. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers
all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of September30, 2015, of the $20 million aggregate cash and cash equivalents held by the Company, the amount of cash and cash
equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was $19 million. If the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our operations in the United States, the repatriation of some of these funds to the United States could require payment of
additional U.S. taxes. Trade Accounts Receivable 
The majority of the Companys accounts receivable are due from entities in, or distributors or value added resellers to, the education, corporate and
government sectors. Credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable are typically due within 30 days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of
an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered to be past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts
receivable are past due, the Companys previous loss history, the customers current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes-off accounts
receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Interest is not accrued on past due receivables. 
Inventory Valuation Inventory consists of raw
materials and supplies used in the assembly of Mediasite recorders and finished units. Inventory of completed units and spare parts are carried at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. 
Inventory consists of the following in thousands:  September30 2015 2014 Raw materials and supplies 254 549 Finished goods 2,131 1,411

Capitalized Software Development Costs 
Software development costs incurred in conjunction with product development are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is
established. Thereafter, until the product is released for sale, software development costs are capitalized and reported at the net realizable value of the related product. Typically the period between achieving technological feasibility of the
Companys products and the general availability of the products has been short. Consequently, software development costs qualifying for capitalization are typically immaterial and are generally expensed to research and development costs. During
2013, the Companys My Mediasite product release required software capitalization since there was a longer period between technological feasibility and the general availability of the product. Upon product release, the amortization of software
development costs is determined annually as the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current gross revenues for the products to their total of current and anticipated future gross revenues or the straight-line method over the estimated
economic life of the products, expected to be three years. Amortization expense of software development costs of $178 thousand is included in Cost of Revenue Product for each of the years ending September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The gross amount of capitalized external and internal development costs was $533 thousand at September30, 2015 and 2014. There were no software development efforts that qualified for capitalization for the years ended September30, 2015
or 2014, respectively. Valuation of Assets and Liabilities in Business Combinations 
The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value. Fair value is based on the definition in ASC 820-10-20 as
the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Variations of the cost and market approaches are used to measure the fair value of components of
working capital e.g. accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable and tangible assets, such as property plant and equipment. When measuring the fair value of acquired intangible assets, the income approach is generally considered. Financial
assets and liabilities are valued based on a quoted price in an active market. In the absence of a quoted market price a valuation technique is used to determine fair value, such as a market approach or an income approach. Non-financial liabilities
may be valued based on a transfer approach. These measures require significant judgment including estimates of expected cash flow, or discount rates among others. 
Gain from investment in Mediasite KK The
Companys investment in Mediasite KK was accounted for under the equity method of accounting using a one quarter timing lag through December31, 2013. On January14, 2014, the Companys ownership percentage increased from
approximately 26% of their common stock to 100%. In connection with the acquisition, the one quarter lag in reporting their results was eliminated. The Company upon obtaining control of Mediasite KK recorded a step-up in the value of its
previously owned interest in Mediasite KK to fair value. The gain amounted to approximately $14 million and was partially offset by $901 thousand of tax expense related to such investment. The Company recorded equity in earnings of $38 thousand for
the year ended September30, 2014. The recorded value of this investment is zero at September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to elimination in the consolidated financial statements. 
Property and Equipment Property and equipment are
recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. The estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation are as follows:  Years Leasehold improvements
5to10years
Computer equipment
3 to 5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 to 7 years

For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is recorded at cost and not amortized but, instead, tested at least annually for impairment. We assess the
impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is used and the Company determines that the fair value
of goodwill is more likely than not i.e., a likelihood of more than 50% less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. If goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment, a two-step approach is applied. First,
the Company compares the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of impairment, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value. 
In fiscal 2015 and 2014, we performed the two-step goodwill test and determined that the fair value of goodwill is more than the carrying value. For purposes
of the fiscal 2015 and 2014 tests, goodwill balances are evaluated within three separate reporting units. The Company has recognized no impairment charges as of September30, 2015 or as of September30, 2014. 
If we had determined that the fair value of goodwill was less than its carrying value, based upon the annual test or the existence of one or more indicators
of impairment, we would then measure impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. To the extent the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill, we
would record an impairment charge for the difference. Long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset. For the years ended September30, 2015 and 2014, no events or changes
in circumstances occurred that required this analysis. Comprehensive Loss 
Comprehensive loss includes disclosure of financial information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income. Our comprehensive
loss encompasses net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments. Assets and liabilities of international operations that have a functional currency that is not in U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates, and
revenue and expense items are translated using weighted average exchange rates. Any adjustments arising on translation are included in shareholders equity as an element of accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
Advertising Expense Advertising costs included in
selling and marketing, are expensed when the advertising first takes place. Advertising expense was $655 and $240 thousand for years ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase is a result of increasing spend on internet
advertisements as well as $259 thousand of additional advertising in Japan. Research and Development Costs 
Research and development costs are expensed in the period incurred, unless they meet the criteria for capitalized software development costs. 
Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on
the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which we consider to be permanently invested outside of the U.S. 
55 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
We make judgments regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The balance sheet carrying value of
our net deferred tax assets is based on whether we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets after consideration of all available evidence. We regularly review
our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a
valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence
may be objectively verified. As such, it is generally difficult for positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial
reporting losses. Generally, cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in determining that a valuation allowance is not needed. 
As of September30, 2015 and 2014, valuation allowances have been established for all U.S. and for certain foreign deferred tax assets which we believe
do not meet the more likely than not criteria for recognition. If we are subsequently able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established, then we may be required to recognize
these deferred tax assets through the reduction of the valuation allowance which could result in a material benefit to our results of operations in the period in which the benefit is determined. 
The Company also accounts for the uncertainty in income taxes related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position and measurement of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return. The Company follows the applicable accounting guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure related to the uncertainty in income
tax positions. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Nonfinancial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
The Companys goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets are nonfinancial assets that were acquired either as part of a business combination,
individually or with a group of other assets. These nonfinancial assets were initially measured and recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined as of the date of acquisition. Fair value measurements of reporting units are estimated
using an income approach involving discounted or undiscounted cash flow models that contain certain Level 3 inputs requiring management judgment, including projections of economic conditions and customer demand, revenue and margins, changes in
competition, operating costs, working capital requirements, and new product introductions. Fair value measurements of the reporting units associated with the Companys goodwill balances are estimated at least annually at the beginning of the
fourth quarter of each fiscal year for purposes of impairment testing. Fair value measurements associated with the Companys intangible assets and other long-lived assets are estimated when events or changes in circumstances such as market
value, asset utilization, physical change, legal factors, or other matters indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In determining the
fair value of financial assets and liabilities, the Company currently utilizes market data or other assumptions that it believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market, and
adjusts for non-performance and/or other risk associated with the Company as well as counterparties, as appropriate. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between
observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels: Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices which
are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the Company at the measurement date. 
56 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
Level 2 Inputs: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3
Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at
measurement date. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1, as this level provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while giving the
lowest priority to Level 3. Financial Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on Recurring Basis 
The initial fair values of PFG debt and warrant debt see Note 3 were based on the present value of expected future cash flows and assumptions about current
interest rates and the creditworthiness of the Company Level 3. The fair value of the bifurcated conversion feature represented by the warrant derivative liability which is measured at fair value on a recurring basis is based on a Black Scholes
option pricing model with assumptions for stock price, exercise price, volatility, expected term, risk free interest rate and dividend yield similar to those described for share-based compensation which were generally observable Level 2. 
Financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below in thousands:  September30, 2015

Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
The Companys other financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt instruments,
excluding the PFG debt. The book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, debt excluding the PFG debt and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. The carrying value of capital lease
obligations and debt excluding the PFG debt, including the current portion, approximates fair market value as the variable and fixed rate approximates the current market rate of interest available to the Company.

Legal Contingencies 
In June 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Astute Technology, LLC Astute. The key terms of the agreement were: 1 a grant
of a non-revocable license of Astute patents to the Company; 2 a grant of a fully paid, non-refundable license of certain Sonic Foundry patents to Astute; 3 both Astute and our customer agreed to identify three meetings they currently capture that
the other party will not seek or respond to any request for proposal; and 4 a payment of $135 million to Astute. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the payments were made in three equal amounts with the first paid in June 2014, the second paid
in October 2014 and the final installment paid in March 2015. The Company contributed $11 million of the $135 million payable to Astute with our customer paying the residual amount. Of the $11 million, $428 thousand related to prior use and was
recorded as a charge to income during fiscal 2014. The remaining $672 thousand was recorded as a product right asset, which is being amortized, on a straight-line basis, over the remaining life of the patents, through 2020. Future amounts due to
Astute were accrued for as of the time of settlement. No legal contingencies were recorded for the year ended September30, 2015. Except as reported
above, no legal contingencies were recorded for the year ended September30, 2014. Stock-Based Compensation 
The Company uses a lattice valuation model to account for all employee stock options granted. The lattice valuation model is a more flexible analysis to value
options because of its ability to incorporate inputs that change over time, such as actual exercise behavior of option holders. The Company uses historical data to estimate the option exercise and employee departure behavior in the lattice valuation
model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company considers all employees to have similar exercise behavior and therefore has not identified separate homogenous groups for valuation. The expected
term of options granted is derived from the output of the option pricing model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate for periods the options are expected to be outstanding is based
on the U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Forfeitures are based on actual behavior patterns. The fair value of each option grant is
estimated using the assumptions in the following table:  Years Ending September30 2015

Common Stock Warrants 
On December22, 2014, the company issued 74,802 warrants to two individuals, one of which is the Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors, in
combination with the sale of a like number of shares of common stock. These warrants were immediately exercisable, expire five years after the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $1400. The remaining contractual life of these outstanding
warrants as of September30, 2015 was 423 years. The fair value of the warrants was determined using the lattice model and the same inputs as those used for valuing the Companys stock option fair value. The fair value of the warrants was
$133 thousand at the date of issuance. The Company determined that the warrants are freestanding and do not fall within the scope of ASC 480 or ASC 815. The warrants were recorded in conjunction with the stock issued. 
See Note 3, Credit Arrangements for disclosures on additional warrants issued during fiscal 2015.

Per Share Computation 
Basic earnings loss per share has been computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares that
may be repurchased, and excludes any dilutive effects of options and warrants. In periods where the Company reports net income, diluted net income per share is computed using common equivalent shares related to outstanding options and warrants to
purchase common stock. The numerator for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is net income loss. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted weighted average shares used in the earnings per share

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606. The guidance substantially converges final standards
on revenue recognition between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board providing a framework on addressing revenue recognition issues and, upon its effective date, replaces almost all exiting revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific guidance, in current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In 2015, the FASB subsequently issued a one-year deferral of the effective date for the new revenue reporting standard for entities reporting under U.S. GAAP. In
accordance with the deferral, the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 to determine the impact, if any, it may have on our financial
statements. In November 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No2014-17, Business Combinations Topic 805 Pushdown
Accounting ASU 2014-17. ASU 2014-17 is intended to provide guidance on whether and at what threshold an acquired entity that is a business or nonprofit activity can apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statement.
The amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-17 is effective after November18, 2014. The Company has adopted this guidance, but it does not have an impact on previous acquisitions. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ASU 2015-03, which amends the
current presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, instead of as an asset. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of the new guidance will result in a material impact to its financial statements. 
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software Subtopic 350-40: Customers Accounting for Fees
Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement ASU 2015-05. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. The amendments in ASU 2015-05 are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance may be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the
effective date or retrospectively. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will result in a material impact to its financial statements.

amendments in ASU 2015-11 require an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The amendments in ASU 2015-11 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2016 and interim periods within those
years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not believe the implementation of this standard will
result in a material impact to its financial statements. In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations Topic 805
ASU 2015-16. ASU 2015-16 simplifies the accounting for measurement-period adjustments. This amendments in ASU 2015-16 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the ASU with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company is
currently evaluating this guidance, but it does not have an impact on previous acquisitions. Accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet
effective by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date, which are not discussed above, are not expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements upon adoption. 2.

Partners for Growth IV, L.P. On May13,
2015, Sonic Foundry, Inc., entered into a Loan and Security Agreement the Loan and Security Agreement with Partners for Growth IV, L.P. PFG, the Loan and Security Agreement. 
The Loan and Security Agreement provides for a Term Loan in the amount of $2,000,000, which can be disbursed in two 2Tranches as follows: Tranche 1
was drawn in the amount of $1,500,000 shortly after execution thereof; and Tranche 2 in the amount of $500,000, and can be disbursed at any time, at Sonic Foundrys discretion, following disbursement of Tranche 1 and on or before
December31, 2015, so long as at no Default or Event of Default as defined shall have occurred and be continuing. Each tranche of the Term Loan
bears interest at 1075%per annum. Tranche 1 of the Term Loan is payable interest only until November30, 2015. Thereafter, principal is due in 30 equal monthly principal installments, plus accrued interest, beginning December1,
2015 and continuing until May1, 2018, when the principal balance is to be paid in full. Tranche 2 of the Term Loan is payable using the same repayment schedule as Tranche 1. 
The principal of the Term Loan may be prepaid at any time, provided that Sonic Foundry pays to PFG a prepayment fee equal to 1% of the principal amount
prepaid, if the prepayment occurs in the first year from disbursement of Tranche 1. Coincident with execution of the Loan and Security Agreement, the
Company entered into a Warrant Agreement Warrant with PFG. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant, the Company issued to PFG a warrant to purchase up to 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $966 per
share, subject to certain adjustments, of which 37,500 were exercisable with the disbursement of Tranche 1 and 12,500 become exercisable upon a disbursement under Tranche 2. Pursuant to the Warrant, PFG is also entitled, under certain conditions, to
require the Company to exchange the Warrant for the sum of $200,000 or $150,000, if the Company does not draw on Tranche 2 of the Term Loan. Each warrant issued has an exercise term of 5 years from the date of issuance. 
The warrants could be settled for cash in the event of acquisition of the company, any liquidation of the company, or expiration of the warrant. The Company
has determined the cash payment date to be the expiration date May 14, 2020. Due to the fixed payment amount on the expiration date, the warrant structure is in substance a debt arrangement the Warrant Debt with a zero interest rate,
a fixed maturity date and a feature that makes the debt convertible to common stock. The Warrant Debt had a fair value of $58 thousand. The derivative had a fair value of $120 thousand. The conversion feature is an embedded derivative; thus, for
accounting purposes, the conversion feature is bifurcated and accounted for separately from the PFG Debt and Warrant Debt as a derivative liability measured at fair value at each reporting period. 
As of September30, 2015, the estimated fair value of the derivative liability associated with the warrants issued in connection with the Loan and
Security Agreement, was $109 thousand. The change in the fair value of the derivative liability between the issuance date and September30, 2015, was recorded as a gain of $12 thousand included in the other income expense. 
The proceeds from the Loan and Security Agreement were allocated between the PFG Debt and the Warrant Debt inclusive of its conversion feature based on
their relative fair value on the date of issuance which resulted in initial carrying values of $1322 million and $178 thousand, respectively. The conversion feature of $178 thousand is treated together as a debt discount on the PFG Debt and will be
accreted to interest expense under the effective interest method over the three-year term of the PFG Debt and the five-year term of the Warrant Debt. For fiscal 
63 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
2015, the Company recorded accretion of discount expense associated with the warrants issued with the PFG loan of $5 thousand as well as $22 thousand related to amortization of the debt discount.
There was no accretion of discount expense or related amortization expense recorded in fiscal 2014 as the loan was funded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. 
The fair values of term debt and warrant debt are based on the present value of expected future cash flows and assumptions about current interest rates and
the creditworthiness of the Company Level 3. At May13, 2015, the carrying amounts of the Companys term debt and warrant debt totaled $1322 million and $178 thousand, respectively. At May13, 2015, the Companys term debt and
warrant debt were recorded at fair value. At September30, 2015, the derivative liability was remeasured at fair value. The fair value of the bifurcated conversion feature represented by the warrant derivative liability is based on a Black
Scholes option pricing model with assumptions for stock price, exercise price, volatility, expected term, risk free interest rate and dividend yield similar to those described previously for share-based compensation which were generally observable
Level 2. On August12, 2015, the Company and PFG entered into a waiver agreement to waive the existing covenant default and to change the exercise

In addition to the deferred tax liability detailed above, the Company has a $124 thousand deferred tax asset.
The amount is recorded within the prepaid expenses and other current assets line on the consolidated balance sheet and is primarily related to net operating losses of MSKK. 
At September30, 2015, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $93 million for U.S. Federal and $52 million for state tax
purposes. For Federal tax purposes, the carryforwards expire in varying amounts between 2019 and 2035. For state tax purposes, the carryforwards expire in varying amounts between 2015 and 2034. Utilization of the Companys net operating loss
may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss
carryforwards before utilization. In addition, the Company has research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $418 thousand, which expire in varying amounts between 2019 and 2020. 
The Company maintains an additional paid-in-capital APIC pool which represents the excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation that are
available to absorb future tax deficiencies. If the amount of future tax deficiencies is greater than the available APIC pool, the Company records the excess as income tax expense in its consolidated statements of income. For fiscal 2015 and fiscal
2014, the Company had a sufficient APIC pool to cover any tax deficiencies recorded and as a result, these deficiencies did not affect its results of operations. At September30, 2015, the Company has $11 million of net operating loss carry
forwards for which a benefit would be recorded in APIC when realized. Earnings of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S.
taxation upon repatriation to the U.S. and the Companys tax provision reflects the related incremental U.S. tax except for certain foreign subsidiaries whose unremitted earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. At
September30, 2015, unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. No deferred tax liability has been recognized with regard to the remittance of such earnings after MSKK and MediaMission BV acquisitions
were completed during the year. Because of the availability of U.S. foreign tax credits, it is likely no U.S. tax would be due if such earnings were repatriated. 
Beginning with an acquisition in fiscal year 2002, the Company has amortized Goodwill for tax purposes over a 15 year life. Goodwill is not amortized for book
purposes. Tax amortization is not applicable to the goodwill from the foreign acquisitions that took place during fiscal 2015 since the foreign goodwill is non-deductible for US federal tax purposes. 
The difference between the book and tax balance of certain of the companys goodwill creates a deferred tax liability and an annual tax expense. Because
of the long term nature of the goodwill timing difference, tax planning strategies cannot be utilized with respect to the deferred tax liability. The Companys tax rate differs from the expected tax rate each reporting period as a result of the
aforementioned items. The balance of the Deferred Tax Liability was $43 million at September30, 2015 and September30, 2014, respectively. The Company recorded a deferred tax liability related to the Customer Relationship intangibles
value acquired as part of the purchase of MediaMission BV and Mediasite KK. The Company also recorded tax expense related to the step-up gain on its original equity investment in Mediasite KK. The Company has some other temporary
differences related to its Mediasite KK subsidiary. In accordance with accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes, the Company has concluded
that a reserve for income tax contingencies is not necessary. The Companys practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company had no accruals for interest and penalties on the
Companys Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September30, 2015 or September30, 2014 and has not recognized any interest or penalties in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for either of the twelve month periods
ended September30, 2015 or 2014.

Acquisition of MediaMission Holding B.V. 
On December16, 2013, Sonic Foundry completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of MediaMission Holding B.V., the owner
of 100% of the outstanding stock in MediaMission B.V., MediaMission and MediaMission Hosting B.V. Sonic Foundry paid $1493 million for all the outstanding stock in MediaMission Holding B.V., comprised of $458,000 cash, $687,000
subordinated note payable over three years interest rate of 65% and $348,000 in shares of Sonic Foundry stock. The stock portion of the purchase price consisted of 37,608 shares of Sonic Foundry common stock. In connection with the acquisition of
MediaMission Holding B.V., the Company entered into employment agreements with the two managing principals of MediaMission. As a result of the acquisition, the Company further increased its presence in the European market. The goodwill of $932
thousand arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of the Company and MediaMission. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. 
The Company recorded the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The fair value of the customer
relationships was estimated by applying the income approach. That measure is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, and therefore represents Level 3 inputs. Key assumptions include a discount rate of 28 percent, estimated
effective tax rate of 20 percent, and estimated customer attrition rate of 15 percent. The Company believes that the information provides a reasonable basis for estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The customer
relationship intangible is amortized on a straight line basis over ten year years and amortization is categorized as a selling and marketing expense. The

Acquisition of MSKK 
On January14, 2014, Sonic Foundry paid approximately $57 million for the remaining stock in Mediasite KK, comprised of equal
components of approximately $19 million cash, subordinated note payable in one year interest rate of 5% and value in shares of Sonic Foundry. The stock portion of the purchase price consisted of 189,222
70 Table of Contents Sonic Foundry, Inc. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
For the Year Ended September 30, 2015 
shares of Sonic Foundry common stock. Assets acquired include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and customer relationship and other intangibles and liabilities assumed include
accounts payable, debt, taxes payable and unearned revenues. Prior to completion of this acquisition, the Company owned a minority interest of approximately 26% of Mediasite KK. In connection with the acquisition, the one quarter lag in reporting
their results was eliminated. The Company determined that the acquisition was deemed to be a material business combination. During the second fiscal quarter of 2014, this initial investment was valued at the same amount as the value when control was
achieved which resulted in a non-cash gain of approximately $14 million. This amount was partially offset by a $901 thousand tax expense associated with the gain. As a result of the acquisition, the Company increased its presence in the Japanese
market. The goodwill of $29 million arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies expected from combining the operations of the Company and Mediasite KK. None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. 
The Company recorded the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The fair value of the customer

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

annually for impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value. 
The Company performs annual goodwill impairment test as of July1, and tested goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisitions of Mediasite,
MediaMission and Mediasite KK and determined it was not impaired. For purposes of the test, goodwill on the Companys books is evaluated within three separate reporting units. 
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended September30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, are as follows:  Balance as of September30, 2013 7,576 Goodwill acquired during year Mediasite KK 2,906 MediaMission 933 Foreign currency translation adjustment 230

adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations, although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of pending actions. 
On October26, 2012, a complaint was filed by Astute Technology, LLC Astute against one of our customers in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Texas Case No2:012-cv-689. The complaint alleges patent infringement. Because we agreed to indemnify our customers from costs and damages in connection with infringement we defended the complaint. 
On February5, 2013, we filed a complaint against Astute in the Western District of Wisconsin Case No13-cv-87. The complaint is for declaratory
judgment of non-infringement and invalidity of three Unites States patents held by Astute. In June 2014, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with Astute Technology, LLC Astute. The key terms of the agreement were: 1 a grant of a non-revocable license of Astute patents to the Company; 2 a grant of a fully paid, non-refundable license of certain Sonic Foundry patents to
Astute; 3 both Astute and our customer agreed to identify three meetings they currently capture that the other party will not seek or respond to any request for proposal; and 4 a payment of $135 million to Astute. Pursuant to the settlement
agreement, the payments were made in three equal amounts with the first paid in June 2014, the second paid in October 2014 and the final installment paid in March 2015. The Company contributed $11 million of the $135 million payable to Astute with
our customer paying the residual amount. Of the $11 million, $428 thousand related to prior use and was recorded as a charge to income during fiscal 2014. The remaining $672 thousand was recorded as a product right asset, which is being amortized,
on a straight-line basis, over the remaining life of the patents, through 2020. Future amounts due to Astute were accrued for at the time of settlement.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
Based on evaluations as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the
participation of our management team, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e, and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based
on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September30, 2015. 
Limitations on the effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Managements Assessment 
Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the
circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act
Rules 13a-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control- Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the 2013 COSO Framework on May14, 2013. The 2013 COSO Framework outlines the 17 underlying principles and the following fundamental components of a companys internal control: icontrol
environment, iirisk assessment, iiicontrol activities, ivinformation and communication, and vmonitoring. The 2013 Framework was adopted in the fiscal year ended September30, 2015. 
Based on evaluations at September30, 2015, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, with the participation of our management
team, have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15 eand 15d-15 eunder the Securities Exchange Act and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Disclosure controls and procedures ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that material information relating to the Company is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding

required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September30, 2015. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Company made changes to its internal control over financial reporting as referred to in Paragraph 4b of the Certifications of the Companys
principal executive officer and principal financial officer included as exhibits to this report as it relates to the acquisitions that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect the Companys internal control over financial
reporting. We reported on three material weaknesses during fiscal 2015. The first material weakness was in internal control over the financial reporting
and monitoring of Mediasite KK MSKK which was identified in fiscal 2013. Our internal controls related to the capture of MSKKs historical information, the accounting for our investment in MSKK based on that information, and the
review of such accounting did not operate effectively and were not sufficient to ensure that our accounting was in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The second material weakness related to controls over the research and
analysis of accounting for non-standard contract provisions which was identified in fiscal 2014. The company did not adequately assess some unique contract implications of one large contract with a customer during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.
Both of these material weaknesses were remediated by the quarter ending December31, 2014. The third material weakness relates to controls over the preparation of consolidated financial statements and was first reported in fiscal 2014. We
instituted certain controls and procedures to obtain the necessary information to properly consolidate the foreign operations and added additional resources to address any non-standard contract provisions. The controls and procedures allow the
Company to obtain accurate financial information in a timely fashion which is in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. The third quarter of fiscal 2014 also represented the first full quarter of operations of the foreign
subsidiaries as part of consolidated operations. Over time, we have continued to gain an understanding of the laws and customs which we were previously unfamiliar with, overcame certain challenges with language barriers and time zone differences,
and implemented controls surrounding the consolidation of these foreign operations with our domestic operations. The third material weakness was remediated during fiscal 2015. 
Remediation The aforementioned internal controls over
financial reporting of our foreign operations have provided a framework to remediate the material weakness surrounding our consolidation process. We reviewed our processes and controls and deployed our additional accounting resources to design and
implement effective controls over our consolidation process. Finally, we utilized our additional resources to appropriately address any non-standard contract provisions during the year. We feel that our efforts to establish processes and controls as
well as adding additional resources to our accounting team made significant improvements to our processes and controls and that the Company has remediated each of the aforementioned material weaknesses. Item 1.
