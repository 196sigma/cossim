REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To
the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. In
our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP

CIPHERGEN BIOSYSTEMS,INC.      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    
1.Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  The Company  Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. the Company or Ciphergen develops, manufactures and sells ProteinChip Systems for life science researchers.
The core technology, which is patented, is Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization SELDI. The systems consist of ProteinChip Readers, ProteinChip Software and related accessories, which are
used in conjunction with consumable ProteinChip Arrays. These products are sold primarily to biologists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and academic and government research
laboratories. The Company also provides research services through its Biomarker Discovery Center laboratories and process proteomics centers, and chromatography sorbents used for protein
purification through its BioSepra subsidiary.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company reported its 30% ownership interest in Ciphergen Biosystems KK, a joint venture in Japan, using
the equity method of accounting through August31, 2002, at which time the Company acquired a 70% majority interest and began consolidation of Ciphergen Biosystems KK, with the noncontrolling
interest being reported as minority interest in the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Certain Risks and Uncertainties  The Company products and services are currently concentrated in a single segment of the life science research field, which is characterized by rapid
technological advances and changes in customer requirements. The success of the Company depends on management ability to anticipate and to respond quickly and adequately to technological
developments in its industry, changes in customer requirements and changes in industry standards. Any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or services could have a
material adverse effect on the Company business and operating results. The
Company licenses certain technologies that are used in products that represent substantially all of its revenues. An inability to retain such technology licenses could result in a
material adverse effect to the Company. Additionally, some of the raw materials and components used in its products are from single-source suppliers. If the Company is unable to obtain such raw
materials and components, its financial condition and operating results could be significantly impacted. 
58  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Investments  Management determines the appropriate classification of the Company investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase, and
re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies all securities as available-for-sale and carries them at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses related to these securities included as a component of other comprehensive income until realized. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest income. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method. The cost of securities sold is
based on the specific identification method. 
The
Company investment objectives include the safety and preservation of invested funds and liquidity of investments that is sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. Cash, cash
equivalents and investments in debt securities are with high credit-quality financial institutions, commercial companies and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. However,
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value; therefore, the estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized or would
be paid in a current market exchange. The effect of using different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may be material to the estimated fair value amounts. 
The
carrying amounts of certain of the Company financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair
value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the capital leases approximates their fair value based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar
terms. The fair value of
the equipment financing loan was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using applicable spreads to approximate current interest rates available to the Company. Convertible senior notes have
an estimated fair value based on quoted market prices. The fair values of the equipment financing loan and the convertible senior notes as compared to their book values as of December31, 2003
were as follows in thousands: BookValue
FairValue Equipment financing loan 1,752 1,752 Convertible senior notes 27,515 32,400 29,267 34,152 Concentration of Credit Risk  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Most of
the Company cash and cash equivalents as of December31, 2003 were deposited with financial institutions in the U.S. and exceeded federally 
59 
insured
amounts. The Company also maintains cash deposits with banks in Western Europe, Canada, China and Japan. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash
equivalents. 
The
Company accounts receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable. No customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2003 or 2002.  Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis, or market value.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed for financial reporting
purposes principally using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery and equipment, 2-8years; computer equipment and software,
3-4years; furniture and fixtures, 3-10years; buildings and leasehold improvements, the lesser of their economic life or the term of the underlying lease. Assets
being installed or under construction are shown as construction in progress. Construction in progress is valued based on expenditures incurred up to the balance sheet date. When the constructed asset
is ready for its intended purpose, the total cost is transferred to the relevant asset class and depreciation commences. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as incurred. Gains
and losses resulting from disposals of assets are reflected in the year of disposition.  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired in the Company
acquisitions of IllumeSys Pacific,Inc. in 1997, Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. in 1998, BioSepra S.A. in 2001 and Ciphergen Biosystems KK in 2002. Prior to the adoption of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No142 SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January1, 2002, goodwill was being amortized on a straight-line basis
over five years. 
Goodwill
is reviewed for impairment at least annually and in the interim whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. Upon
adoption of
SFAS142, the Company performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and noted no such impairment of goodwill. 
Other
intangible assets consist of patents and developed product technology arising from the acquisition of the BioSepra business, as well as a technology license acquired in connection
with the settlement of litigation in 2003. These intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of seven years in the case of the patents and
developed product technology and 17years in the case of the technology license. They are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
of an asset may no longer be recoverable. 
60  Long-lived Assets  Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of an asset group carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the
asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets. Other long-term assets consist primarily of the offering costs of the convertible senior notes and security deposits for the
Company leased facilities.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue from product sales is recognized upon product shipment, provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables are deemed probable.
Revenue from shipping and handling is generally recognized upon product shipment, based on the amount billed to customers for shipping and handling. The related cost of shipping and handling is
included in cost of revenue upon product shipment. 
The
Company generally offers a standard warranty in the form of a maintenance contract on each ProteinChip System, ProteinChip TandemMS Interface and accessory shipped. These
typically include coverage for parts, labor and software bug fixes for a specified period, typically one year. Revenue
related to these maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the maintenance contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect the Company warranty costs include
the number of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. Revenue from separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts is deferred and
recognized over the maintenance contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Revenue
from research contracts is recognized as the work is performed, based on the achievement of substantive milestones described in the contracts. Revenue from up-front
payments is deferred and recognized ratably over the expected term of the research contract. For
revenue arrangements with multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time for example, where Ciphergen has delivered the hardware and software but is also obligated
to provide services, maintenance and/or training, the Company evaluates whether the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer, whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is
reliably determinable, and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within the Company control. When all these conditions are met, the Company recognizes revenue on the
delivered elements. If any one of these conditions is not met, the Company defers the recognition of revenue until all these conditions are met or all elements have been delivered. Fair values for
ongoing maintenance are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers. Fair values for services, such as training or consulting, are based upon separate sales by the Company of those
services to other customers.  Research and Development Costs  Research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and related costs,
materials and supplies used in the development of new products, and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers. Software development costs incurred in the research and development of new
products are expensed as incurred 
61 
until
technological feasibility is established. To date, products and upgrades have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time.  Advertising Costs  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $232,000 in 2003, $354,000 in 2002 and $313,000 in 2001.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company accounts for its stock-based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method of accounting. Unearned compensation expense is based
on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Company stock and the exercise price. Unearned compensation is amortized and expensed using an accelerated method.
The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees using the fair value method of accounting. Had
compensation expense for options granted to employees, officers and directors been determined based on fair value at the grant date, the Company net loss per share would have
increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per share data: Years Ended December31 2003

value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in 2003, 2002 and 2001 with the following weighted assumptions: Stock Option Plan
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 2003
2002

price 62 
The
expected average life is based on the assumption that stock options on average are exercised 5years after they are granted. The risk-free interest rate was
calculated in accordance with the grant date and expected average life.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation
allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.  Foreign Currency Translation  The functional currencies of BioSepra S.A. and Ciphergen Biosystems KK are the euro and yen, respectively. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of these
operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect
during the period. The gains and losses from foreign currency translation of these subsidiaries' financial statements are recorded directly into a separate component of stockholders' equity under the
caption Accumulated other comprehensive income. 
The
functional currency of all other non-U.S. operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities of these foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars at current period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of expense are translated using historical rates of exchange. Income and expense
elements are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are recorded as other
income or loss in the statement of operations, and were not material for all years presented.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on Issue No00-21 EITF 00-21, Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or
rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF 00-21 apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2003, with earlier application permitted.
The Company adopted EITF 00-21 on January1, 2003, which did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or
consolidated cash flows. 
In
May2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No150 SFAS150, Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS150 established standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with
characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS150 was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning
of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS150 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial position, consolidated results
of operations or consolidated cash flows. 
63  In
May2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No03-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, to
Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software. The FASB ratified this consensus in August2003. EITF Issue
No03-5 affirms that AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 applies to non-software deliverables, such as hardware, in an arrangement if the software is essential
to the functionality of the non-software deliverables. The adoption of EITF Issue No03-5 did not have a material impact on the Company consolidated financial
position, consolidated statement of operations or consolidated cash flows. 
In
December2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No104, Revenue Recognition, which codifies, revises and rescinds certain sections of SAB
No101, Revenue Recognition, in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The changes
noted in SAB No104 did not have a material effect on the Company consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows. 2.Marketable Securities

Depreciation
expense for property, plant and equipment was $4,112 in 2003, $3,076 in 2002 and $2,082 in 2001. 
5.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
The Company adopted SFAS142 on January1, 2002 for all goodwill and other intangible assets. As a result, goodwill is no longer amortized but
rather tested for impairment at least annually and in the interim whenever circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Upon adoption, the Company performed a transitional goodwill impairment
assessment and noted no such impairment of goodwill. The Company also performed annual impairment tests in 2002 and 2003, and determined that 
65  no
impairment had occurred. Goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following in thousands: December 31, 2003

May28, 2014, provided that such license fees will not exceed $10million during calendar year 2003 or $100million in the aggregate. The
total cost of the litigation settlement amounted to $208million, of which $73million was attributed to periods prior to April1, 2003 and expensed in the
second quarter of 2003. $906,000 was amortized to cost of revenue in the remainder of 2003, and the remaining $126million will be amortized to cost of revenue in future periods through the
second quarter of 2014.

Ciphergen has a direct field service organization that provides service for its products. The Company generally includes a standard 12month warranty on
its ProteinChip Systems, ProteinChip Tandem MS Interfaces and accessories in the form of a maintenance contract upon initial sale, after which maintenance and support may be provided under a
separately priced contract or on an individual call basis. 
Changes
in product warranty obligations, including separately priced maintenance obligations, during the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002 were as follows in thousands: 2003
2002 Balance at beginning of period 1,800 1,096 Add: Costs incurred for maintenance contracts 2,009 1,299 Revenue deferred for separately priced maintenance contracts 5,221 2,737 Less: Settlements made under maintenance contracts 2,009 1,299 Revenue recognized for separately priced maintenance contracts 3,579 2,033 Balance at end of period 3,442 1,800 Revenue
for maintenance contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable maintenance contract. Costs are recognized as incurred. 
67  8.Long-term Debt and Capital Leases  Convertible Senior Notes  On August22, 2003, the Company closed the sale of $300million of convertible senior notes due September1, 2008. Offering costs were
approximately $18million. Interest on the notes is 45% per annum on the principal amount, payable semiannually on March1 and September1, beginning March1, 2004. The
notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity of the notes into shares of the Company common stock initially at a conversion rate of 1088329 shares per
$1,000 principal amount of the notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $919 per share. The conversion price, and hence the conversion rate, is subject to adjustment upon the
occurrence of certain events, such as stock splits, stock dividends and other distributions or recapitalizations. Because the market value of the stock rose above the conversion price between the day
the notes were priced and the closing date, the Company recorded a discount of $2,677,000 related to the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature resulting from this price change and the
fact that the initial purchaser of the notes was not required to purchase the notes until the closing date. Immediately after the closing, Ciphergen common stock had a market price of $1001 per
share, or $082 per share higher than the conversion price. The value of the beneficial conversion feature was determined by multiplying this difference in the per share price of Ciphergen common
stock by the 3,264,987 underlying shares. This amount will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the five-year term of the notes, or shorter period in
the event of conversion of the notes. Amortization in 2003 amounted to $192,000. 
The
notes are the Company senior unsecured obligations and rank on parity in right of payment with all of the Company existing and future senior unsecured debt and rank senior to the
Company existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes. The notes are also effectively subordinated in right of payment to the Company existing and future
secured debt, to the
extent of such security, and to its subsidiaries' liabilities. The indenture does not limit the incurrence by the Company or its subsidiaries of other indebtedness. The
Company may redeem the notes at its option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after September1, 2006 at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest,
provided that the notes will be redeemable only if the closing price of the stock equals or exceeds 150% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days within a period of 30
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date of the notice of the redemption. The 3,264,987 shares that could be issued if all convertible senior notes were converted into common
stock have not been included in the calculation of loss per share, as these potential common shares are antidilutive. Upon a change of control, each holder of the notes may require the Company to
repurchase some or all of the notes at specified redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The debenture contains a put option that entitles the holder to require the Company to redeem the
debenture at a price equal to 110% of the principal balance upon a change in control of the Company prior to August31, 2004 1075% from September1, 2004 through August31, 2005
and 1050% thereafter. The Company does not anticipate that the put option will have significant value because no change of control is currently contemplated.  Equipment Financing Loan  In June2003, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation to obtain financing for up to
$50million of capital equipment purchases. The loan 
68 
is
collateralized by the equipment being financed as well as certain other assets of the Company. As of December31, 2003, the Company had financed $21million of capital equipment
purchases through this facility at an annual interest rate of 748%, repayable in monthly installments over 36months from the date of each drawdown under the agreement. As of
December31, 2003, the balance outstanding on the loan, including interest charges, was $19million, with the final payment scheduled for July1, 2006. The Company may utilize
the remaining balance of this facility to purchase additional capital equipment no later than June30, 2004.  Capital Leases  The Company leases its facility in France under a capital lease with an independent finance company, which expires on February3, 2011. Upon expiration,
the Company may acquire the facility for a nominal amount. The Company also leases certain machinery and equipment in Japan under capital
lease agreements with Sumitomo Corporation and other independent finance companies; these leases expire at various times through March31, 2008. The interest rate on one capital lease is
variable based on the Euribor rate; the others are fixed rates. The weighted average interest rate was 39% at December31, 2003. 
As
of December31, 2003, future minimum lease payments under capital lease agreements were as follows in thousands: 2004 421 2005 408 2006 407 2007 410 2008 411 2009 and after 937 Total minimum lease payments 2,994 Less: amount representing interest 396 Present value of minimum lease payments 2,598 Less: Current portion 324 Non-current portion 2,274 9.Foreign Currency Contracts 
During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of currency fluctuations as a
result of an intercompany loan of approximately $10million, denominated in yen, to the Company subsidiary in Japan. The effect of exchange rate changes on the forward exchange contracts is
expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the intercompany loan. As of December31, 2003, the Company had one forward contract to sell approximately 107million Japanese
yen at a rate of 10686 yen per U.S. dollar. Because there is no fixed maturity date for the intercompany loan, the Company closes each forward contract and enters a new one monthly. Net realized
foreign currency gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in other income expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the
year ended December31, 2003. 
69  10.Commitments and Contingencies  Operating Leases  The Company leases various equipment and facilities to support its worldwide manufacturing, research and development, Biomarker Discovery Center, and sales and
marketing activities. Total rent expense under all leases, net of sublease income, was $3,514,000, $2,828,000 and $1,791,000 in the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The Company leases its Fremont facility under a non-cancelable operating lease that expires on July31, 2008. The lease provides for escalations of lease payments of approximately 4% per year.
Sublease income paid by a tenant at the Company Fremont facility was $0 in 2003, $475,000 in 2002 and $1,583,000 in 2001. 
As
of December31, 2003, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, exclusive of sublease income, were as follows in thousands: 2004 3,982 2005 3,765 2006 3,408 2007 3,280 2008 2,766 17,201 In
March 2004, the Company entered into a six-year lease agreement for an office and lab in the U.K. Total payments will be approximately $811,000 over the life of the lease.  Inventory Purchase Obligations  The Company has non-cancelable agreements with certain vendors obligating Ciphergen to purchase approximately $1million of inventory during 2004.  Joint Development Agreement  In February1995, the Company entered into a joint development agreement with Stanford Research Systems which was amended in June2000. It provided
for the issuance of a total of 949,113 shares of SeriesB preferred stock upon achievement of specified development milestones. All preferred stock converted to common stock on a
one-for-one basis on September26, 2000 in conjunction with the Company initial public offering. Through December31, 1999, a total of 712,613 shares of
preferred stock were issued under the agreement. During 2000, two additional milestones were attained and 25,800 shares of preferred stock valued at $379,000 and 12,900 shares of common stock valued
at $142,000 were issued, respectively. In 2001, a total of 51,600 common shares valued at $268,000 were issued upon the attainment of four additional milestones. In 2002, 49,450 common shares valued
at $131,000 were issued upon completion of a milestone. No shares were issued pursuant to this agreement in 2003. The remaining 96,750 shares will be issued as common stock upon
the achievement of additional milestones. The value of these shares was recorded as research and development expense when the development milestones were achieved. 11.Stockholders' Equity 
At December31, 2003 and 2002, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock were authorized, but no shares were issued or outstanding. 
70  12.Stock Options, Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan  1993 Stock Option Plan  The Company has no shares of common stock reserved for sale to employees, directors or consultants under its 1993 Stock Option Plan the 1993 Plan. Under the
1993 Plan, options were granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of the common stock for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options are exercisable
when granted and such unvested shares are subject to repurchase upon termination of employment. Should the employment of the holders of common stock subject to repurchase terminate prior to full
vesting of the outstanding shares, the Company may repurchase all unvested shares at a price per share equal to the original exercise price. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years.
At December31, 2003, a total of approximately 65,000 shares of common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average repurchase price of $286 per share. Unexercised
options generally expire ten years from the date of grant five years for incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company common stock. Since the Company IPO, no
options have been granted under the 1993 Plan. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, options for 117,553, 59,427 and 84,731 shares were exercised, respectively. Options for 137,621, 80,113 and 24,319 shares
were canceled during 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively, and the shares reserved under the 1993 Plan were reduced by the same amount.  2000 Stock Plan  In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Stock Plan the 2000 Plan. At December31, 2003, the Company had 494,254 shares of common stock
reserved for sale to employees, directors and consultants under this stock option plan. Under the 2000 Plan, options may be granted at prices not lower than 85% and 100% of the fair market value of
the common stock for nonstatutory and statutory stock options, respectively. Options generally vest monthly over a period of five years. During 2001, options for 1,105,100 shares were granted and
options for 41,517 shares were canceled. No options were exercised in 2001. During 2002, options for 1,183,400 shares were granted, options for 2,666 shares were exercised, and options for 126,634

2,032 474 Stock-Based Compensation 
During the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, the exercise prices of all options granted were equal to fair market value on the dates of grant.
During the period from April1997 through December31, 2003, the Company recorded $211million of stock-based compensation related to stock options granted to consultants and
employees. For options granted to consultants, the 
72  Company
determined the fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: expected lives of five years; weighted average risk-free rate
calculated using rates between 45% and 62%; expected dividend yield of zero percent; volatility of 75% and deemed values of common stock between $035 and $1467 per share. Stock compensation
expense is being recognized in accordance with an accelerated amortization method, over the vesting periods of the related options, which are generally five years. 
The
allocation of stock-based compensation expense by functional area was as follows in thousands: Years Ended December31 2003
2002
2001 Cost of revenue 81 124 232 Research and development 187 36 583 Sales and marketing 274 398 919 General and administrative 876 1,586 2,913 Total stock-based compensation 1,418 2,072 4,647 Warrants 
At December31, 2002, warrants to purchase 9,010 shares of common stock were outstanding, at a weighted average exercise price of $354 per share. These
warrants were exercised or canceled during 2003, and at December31, 2003, no warrants remained outstanding. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In April2000, the stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company
through payroll deductions. Purchases are made semi-annually at a price equal to the lower of 85% of the closing price on the applicable offering commencement date or 85% of the closing
price at the end of the purchase period. At December31, 2003, the Company had 15,454 shares of common stock reserved for purchase by employees under this Plan. During 2003, 2002 and 2001,
purchases of 310,026, 175,519 and 114,001 shares, respectively, were made under this Plan. There was no activity under this plan in 2000. 
On
January1, 2003 and 2004, an additional 250,000 and 290,795 shares, respectively, were reserved for purchase under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 13.Income Taxes 
The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the current tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the
amounts expected to be realized. 
The
provision for income taxes was due to current foreign income taxes, which were $14million, $61,000 and $143,000 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. 
Based
on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has
provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2003. 
73  Net
deferred tax assets liabilities consisted of the following in thousands: December31 2003

of December31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1114million for federal and $210million for state tax purposes. If
not utilized, these carryforwards will expire beginning in 2009 for federal purposes and 2004 for state purposes. 
The
Company had research credit carryforwards of approximately $32million and $32million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the
federal research credit carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in 2010. The California research credit can be carried forward indefinitely. The
Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event
the Company has a change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted. 
Deferred
taxes are not provided for the earnings of the Company foreign subsidiaries, as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of the foreign
subsidiaries and the Company intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings to expand its international operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional
tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings should they become subject to U.S. tax. 
14.Net Loss per Share 
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential common shares outstanding during the period, if their effect is dilutive.
Potential common shares include 
74  common
stock subject to repurchase, common stock issuable under the Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
warrants.

In January1999, the Company formed Ciphergen Biosystems KK and took a 30% equity interest in this joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation to distribute
the Company products in Japan. On August31, 2002, the Company acquired an additional 40% ownership in Ciphergen Biosystems KK, bringing its total ownership to 70%. Ciphergen believes
acquiring majority control of Ciphergen Biosystems KK will facilitate expansion of the Company activities in Japan, including the establishment of a Biomarker Discovery Center laboratory and the
distribution of BioSepra sorbents. The Company paid $424,000 in cash for the additional shares of Ciphergen Biosystems KK common stock and incurred direct acquisition costs of $22,000. The acquisition
was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Accordingly, the results of operations of Ciphergen Biosystems KK and the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
were included in the Company consolidated financial statements beginning September1, 2002. The Company acquired $1,318,000 of 
75  cash
with Ciphergen Biosystems KK and paid $3,960,000 to repay working capital loans Sumitomo had provided to the joint venture. The
total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows in thousands: Tangible net assets acquired Accounts receivable, net, and other current assets 1,352 Inventories 376 Property and equipment 1,300 Other tangible assets 326 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including working capital loans 5,469 Capital lease obligations 376 2,491 Excess of purchase price over net assets acquired 1,619 Net cash acquired upon purchase of Ciphergen Biosystems KK common stock 872 The
amount of the purchase price in excess of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and is evaluated for impairment at least annually and more often if circumstances warrant. 
16.Acquired In-Process Technology 
In connection with the acquisiton of BioSepra in 2001, the Company recorded a $10million charge to acquired in-process technology. The amount
was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The value of the projects identified to be in
progress was determined by estimating the future cash flows of the product and discounting those net cash flows back to their present value at a discount rate consistent with the inherent risk of the
particular project. The net cash flows from the identified in-process projects were expected to commence at various times from 2002 to 2004 and included estimates of research and
development costs needed to bring the project from its current state of development to a point of commercial feasibility. The cash flows were based on expected future revenues, cost of revenues,
selling, general and administrative costs, research and development costs needed to maintain the project throughout its life cycle, and applicable income taxes for the projects. The discount rates
used in the present value calculations were derived from the weighted-average cost of capital of BioSepra and adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle of the
particular project. Such discount rates ranged between 19% and 25% for all projects. Development of the technologies remains a substantial risk to the Company due to factors including the remaining
effort to achieve technological feasibility, rapidly changing customer markets and competitive threats from other companies. Actual expenses incurred to date have not been materially different from
those used in the calculations described above. 
17.Employee Benefit Plans 
The Company maintains the Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc. 401k Savings Plan for its U.S. employees. The Plan allows eligible employees to defer up to 90 subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit, of their pretax compensation at the discretion of the employee. 
76  Under
the Plan, the Company is not required to make Plan contributions. The Company had not made any contributions to the Plan as of December31, 2003. 
18.Related Parties 
At December31, 2002, the Company had two non-interest bearing notes receivable totaling $230,000 from an officer. The notes were repaid in
2003 on or before their maturity dates. Additionally, the Company has various notes receivable from officers and employees in the aggregate amount of approximately $11million related to the
early exercise of stock options. These full recourse notes have five-year terms, bear interest between 582% and 680% per annum and are collateralized by the underlying stock and other
personal assets. All notes receivable related to the early exercise of options become due immediately upon termination of employment. At December31, 2003, accrued interest on these notes
amounted to $272,000. 
During
the year ended December31, 2002, the Company recorded revenue of approximately $800,000 on sales to a related party. These sales were transactions related to the sale of
equipment and consumables to the Company Japanese joint venture prior to August31, 2002, at which point the Company acquired majority control. The Company also purchased $548,000, $894,000
and $372,000 of inventory in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, from a related party, and in 2002 and 2001 made non-cash payments in the form of Ciphergen common stock to this related
party under the terms of a joint development agreement. See Note10. 
19.Segment Information and Geographic Data 
Ciphergen revenue is derived from the sales of related products and services on a worldwide basis. Although discrete components that earn revenues and incur
expenses exist, significant expenses such as sales and marketing and corporate administration are not incurred by nor allocated to these operating units but rather are employed by the entire
enterprise. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker evaluates resource allocation not on a product or geographic basis, but rather on an enterprise-wide basis. Therefore,
management has determined that Ciphergen operates in only one reportable segment, which is the protein research tools and collaborative services business. 
The
following table reflects the results of the Company sales to external customers by similar products and services for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 in
