PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Insight Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries the Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the years in the three-year period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.generally
accepted accounting principles. As discussed in note11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No109, as of January1, 2007. As discussed in note12
to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No123R, Share-Based Payment, as of January1, 2006. As discussed in note1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No47, Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations an interpretation of FASB Statement No143, as of
December31, 2005. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, Insight Enterprises, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, and our report
dated February27, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. s/ KPMG LLP Phoenix, Arizona

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Insight Enterprises, Inc. We have audited Insight Enterprises, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Insight
Enterprises, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Item9A a, Managements Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Insight Enterprises, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December31, 2007, and our report dated February27, 2008, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. s/ KPMG LLP Phoenix, Arizona

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business We are a leading provider of brand-name information technology IT hardware, software and
services to large enterprises, small- to medium-sized businesses SMB and public sector
institutions in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia-Pacific. The Company is
organized in the following three operating segments, which are primarily defined by their related
geographies   
Operating Segment
Geography   North America
United States and Canada     EMEA
Europe, Middle East and Africa     APAC
Asia-Pacific Currently, our offerings in North America and the United Kingdom include brand-name IT
hardware, software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA segment and in APAC
currently only include software and select software-related services. Acquisitions and Dispositions On January24, 2008, we announced the signing of an agreement and plan of merger to acquire
privately-held Calence, LLC Calence, one of the nations largest independent technology service
providers specializing in Cisco networking solutions, unified communications and managed services.
This acquisition is consistent with our vision and strategy to become a global value added reseller
of technology solutions through continued investment in certain key technology categories,
including networking and advanced communications. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we will
acquire Calence for a purchase price of $125,000,000. Up to an additional $35,000,000 in purchase
price consideration may be due if certain performance targets are achieved over the next four
years. The purchase price is subject to customary working capital and hold-back adjustments. The
acquisition has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to
customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval. We expect the acquisition to close
early in second quarter of 2008. On March1, 2007, we completed the sale of PC Wholesale, a division of our North America
operating segment. As a result of the disposition, PC Wholesales results of operations for all
periods presented are classified as a discontinued operation. See further information in Note 19. On September7, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Software Spectrum, a global technology
solutions provider with expertise in the selection, purchase and management of software. The cash
purchase price of $287,000,000 plus working capital of $64,380,000, which included cash acquired of
$30,285,000, was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over fair
value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Software Spectrums results of operations
have been included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date. On June30, 2006, we completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding stock of Direct Alliance
Corporation Direct Alliance, a business process outsourcing provider in the U.S., for a cash
purchase price of $46,250,000, subject to earn out and claw back provisions. Accordingly, Direct
Alliances results of operations for all periods presented are classified as a discontinued
operation. See further information in Note 19. Principles of Consolidation and Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. References to the Company, we, us, our and other similar
words refer to Insight Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context
suggests otherwise. 50 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these estimates
and assumptions affect the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts, write-downs of inventories,
litigation-related obligations and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade receivables are not overstated
due to uncollectibility. The allowance is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable
based on historical write-offs, evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic
environment. We write off individual accounts against the reserve when we become aware of a
clients or vendors inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of bankruptcy
filings, or deterioration in the clients or vendors operating results or financial position. Inventories We state inventories, principally purchased IT hardware, at the lower of weighted average cost
which approximates cost under the first-in, first-out method or market. We evaluate inventories
for excess, obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal
margins. Write-downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value
and take into account our contractual provisions with our partners governing price protection,
stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence. Inventories not available for sale relate to product sales transactions in which we are
warehousing the product and will be deploying the product to clients designated locations
subsequent to period-end. Additionally, we may perform services on a portion of the product prior
to shipment to our clients and will be paid a fee for doing so. Although the product contracts are
non-cancelable with customary credit terms beginning the date the inventories are segregated in our
warehouse and invoiced to the client, and the warranty periods begin on the date of invoice, these
transactions do not meet the sales recognition criteria under GAAP. Therefore, we have not
recorded sales and the inventories are classified as inventories not available for sale on our
consolidated balance sheet until the product is shipped. If clients remit payment before we ship
product to them, we record the payments received as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance
sheet until such time as the product is shipped. Property and Equipment We state property and equipment at cost. We capitalize major improvements and betterments,
while maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed as incurred. Depreciation or
amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated economic lives
of the assets   
Estimated Economic Life
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of underlying lease term or asset life   Furniture and fixtures
2-7 years   Equipment
3-5 years   Software
3-10 years   Buildings
29 years Costs incurred to develop internal-use software during the application development stage are
capitalized. External direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining
internal-use computer software and payroll and payroll-related costs for teammates who are directly
associated with and who devote time to internal-use computer software projects, to the extent of
the time spent directly on the project, are capitalized. 51 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which
indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets
may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of long-lived assets
may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected
undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their
remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any, is based on the
excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated
fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. We perform an annual review
in the fourth quarter of every year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment
exist, to determine if the carrying value of recorded goodwill is impaired. The impairment review
process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying
value. See additional discussion of the impairment review process at Note 4. Intangible Assets We amortize intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Software Spectrum using the
straight-line method over the following estimated economic lives of the intangible assets

Fully amortized at December31, 2007 Self Insurance We are self-insured for medical insurance up to certain annual stop-loss limits and workers
compensation claims up to certain deductible limits. We establish reserves for claims, both
reported and incurred but not reported, using currently available information as well as our
historical claims experience. As of December31, 2007, we have
$800,000 on deposit with our claims
administrator which acts as security for our future payment obligations under our workers
compensation program. Foreign Currencies We use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency. The functional currencies of our
significant foreign subsidiaries are generally the local currencies. Accordingly, assets and
liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at
the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for
each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in other
comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity. Net foreign currency
transaction gainslosses, including transaction gainslosses on intercompany balances that are
not of a long-term investment nature, are reported as a separate component of non-operating
incomeexpense in our consolidated statements of earnings. Sales Recognition We adhere to guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in Staff Accounting
Bulletin No104, Revenue Recognition SAB 104, issued by the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission the SEC. Under SAB 104, sales are recognized when title and risk of loss
are passed to the client, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale, delivery has
occurred and/or services have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Using these tests, the vast majority of our hardware sales
represent product sales recognized upon shipment. Usual sales terms are F.O.B. shipping point or
equivalent, at which time title and risk of loss have passed to the client and delivery has
occurred. We make provisions for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our
return policy based upon historical return rates. For those sales with F.O.B. destination terms,
we do not recognize sales until products are delivered to the client. 52 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued We also adhere to the guidelines and principles of software revenue recognition described in
Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition SOP 97-2. Revenue is recognized
from software sales when clients acquire the right to use or copy software under license, but in no
case prior to the commencement of the term of the initial software license agreement, provided that
all other revenue recognition criteria have been met i.e., evidence of the arrangement exists, the
fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the fee is probable. From time to time, in the sale of hardware, software and services, we may enter into contracts
that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. Sales of services currently
represent a small percentage of our net sales, and a significant amount of services that are
performed in conjunction with hardware and software sales are completed in our facilities prior to
shipment of the product. In these circumstances, net sales for the hardware, software and services
are recognized upon shipment. Net sales of services that are performed at client locations are
often service-only contracts and are recorded as sales when the services are performed. If the
service is performed at a client location in conjunction with a hardware, software or other
services sale, we recognize net sales in accordance with SAB 104 and Emerging Issues Task Force
EITF 00-21 Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. Accordingly, we
recognize sales for delivered items only when all of the following criteria are satisfied   
the delivered items has value to the client on a stand-alone basis   
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items;
and   
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item,
delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially
in our control. We sell certain third-party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products
for which we are not the primary obligor. These sales do not meet the criteria for gross sales
recognition as defined in SAB 104 and EITF 99-19, Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus
Net as an Agent EITF 99-19, and thus are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. As we
enter into contracts with third-party service providers or vendors, we evaluate whether the
subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales in accordance with
the sales recognition criteria outlined in SAB 104 and EITF 99-19. We determine whether we act as
a principal in the transaction and assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if we are simply
acting as an agent or broker. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded
in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in costs of goods
sold. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is
recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the
transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold. Partner Funding We receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume
sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs.
Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as a reduction
to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is
allocated to inventories based on the applicable incentives from each partner and is recorded in
cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing
expense programs is recorded as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in
the period the program takes place only if the consideration represents a reimbursement of
specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental,
identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. The amount of partner
funding recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses totaled $25,135,000 20,138,000 and $9,630,000 for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
increase from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to the acquisition of Software Spectrum. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as they are incurred. Advertising expense of $26,661,000 23,950,000 and $18,839,000 was recorded for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. These amounts were partially offset by partner funding received pursuant to shared
marketing expense programs recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses, as
discussed above. Shipping and Handling We record freight billed to our clients as net sales and the related freight costs as costs of
goods sold. 53 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable earnings in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the
enactment date. Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations FASB Financial Interpretation No47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations FIN No47 requires that companies recognize a liability for the fair value of a
legal obligation to perform asset-retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if
the amount can be reasonably estimated. Some of our facility leases stipulate that any leasehold
improvements performed by us with landlord approval become the landlords property upon expiration
of the lease. However, some of our landlords further reserve the right to make the determination
as to whether the premises must be returned to their original condition, normal wear and tear
excepted, at our expense. Because of these provisions, we are required to record a liability for
the estimated fair value of this legal obligation to return the premises to the original condition
with the offset recorded as an increase to the cost of the leasehold improvements. Upon adoption
of FIN No47, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded leasehold improvements of $1,310,000
and long term liabilities of $2,289,000. Had the obligation been recorded at January1, 2005, the
balance would have been $1,625,000. Additionally, we recorded a non-cash cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle of $979,000 $649,000, net of tax, representing cumulative
amortization of the leasehold improvements and accretion of the long term liability since the lease
inception dates. The effect on net earnings would have been immaterial and there would have been
no effect on earnings per share if this interpretation had been applied during the year ended
December31, 2005. Net Earnings From Continuing Operations Per Share EPS Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings from continuing operations available to common
stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted
EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the
effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options, restricted stock
awards and restricted stock units. A reconciliation of the denominators of the basic and diluted
EPS calculations follows in thousands, except per share data

Reclassifications Current deferred income tax assets, long-term deferred income tax assets and long-term
deferred income tax liabilities as previously reported of December31, 2006 were increased by
$5,200,000, $900,000 and $6,100,000, respectively. Such reclassification of deferred tax assets
has no effect on previously reported income tax expense amounts. We separately presented buildings held for lease on the consolidated balance sheet at
December31, 2006. We have reported these assets within property and equipment in the accompanying
balance sheets as of December31, 2007 and 2006. See additional discussion in Notes 3 and 19. We reclassified $17,697,000 of accruals for value-added taxes in EMEA at December31, 2006 to
accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheet as of December31, 2006 to conform to the
presentation at December31, 2007. As discussed in Note 19, we have reported the results of operations of PC Wholesale, which we
sold on March1, 2007, as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings for
all periods presented. As a result, the statements of earnings for the years ended December31,
2006 and 2005 have been reclassified. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No157, Fair Value Measurements SFASNo157, which provides guidance for determining fair
value to measure assets and liabilities. The standard also responds to investors requests for
more information about 1the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair
value, 2the information used to measure fair value, and 3the effect that fair-value
measurements have on earnings. SFASNo157 will apply whenever another standard requires or
permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use
of fair value to any new circumstances. SFASNo157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
On February12, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
FSP FAS 157-2, which delays the
effective date of SFAS No157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except
those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis at least annually, until fiscal years beginning after November15, 2008, and interim
periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the FSP. On January1, 2008, we
will adopt SFAS No157, except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities noted in FSP FAS 157-2. We do not expect that the partial
adoption of SFAS No157 in 2008 nor the full adoption in 2009 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In February2007, the FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No115 SFAS No159,
which becomes effective for fiscal periods beginning after November15, 2007. Under SFAS No159,
companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts
at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings
each reporting period. This election, called the fair value option, will enable some companies
to reduce volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
differently. We do not expect that the adoption of SFAS No159 will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial statements and disclosures. In December2007, the FASB issued SFAS No141 revised 2007, Business Combinations
SFASNo141R. SFASNo141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired.
SFASNo141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and
financial effects of the business combination. In addition, under SFASNo141R, changes in
deferred tax asset valuation
allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement
period will impact income taxes. SFASNo141R is effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year
that begins after December15, 2008, and early adoption is not permitted. We will adopt SFAS No.
141R for all business combinations consummated after January1, 2009. 55 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 2 Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents are assumed to be the fair value because of
the liquidity of these instruments. The carrying amounts for accounts receivable, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of our variable rate long-term debt approximates
fair value because these borrowings have variable interest rate terms that approximate market
interest rates for similar debt instruments. 3 Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following in thousands

implement a new IT system. We determined that portions of the old IT system would no longer be
used after March31, 2007, which shortened its estimated useful life and increased the depreciation
for the year ended December31, 2006 by approximately $2,880,000. 4 Goodwill The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December31, 2007 are as

We perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of every year, or more frequently if
indicators of potential impairment exist, to determine if the carrying value of the recorded
goodwill is impaired. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a
significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition,
a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the
strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant
declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to
expected historical or projected future results of operations. The impairment review process
compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. In
testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the estimated fair value of the
reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book
value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If,
however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then we are required to
compare the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. The estimate of implied
fair value of goodwill may require
independent valuations of certain internally generated and unrecognized intangible assets,
such as trademarks. If the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that
goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. The results of
the 2007, 2006 and 2005 annual assessments indicated that goodwill was not impaired. The
adjustments to goodwill primarily consist of foreign currency translation adjustments. 56 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

In September2006, we entered into a credit agreement with various financial institutions that
provides credit facilities of up to $150,000,000 to finance, in part, the acquisition of Software
Spectrum and for general corporate purposes. The credit facilities are composed of a five-year
revolving credit facility in the amount of $75,000,000 and a five-year term loan facility in the
amount of $75,000,000. Additionally, we amended our accounts receivable securitization financing
facility to increase the maximum funding available under the facility to $225,000,000 and extend
its maturity through September7, 2009. Deferred financing fees of $1,552,000 were capitalized in
conjunction with entering into the credit facilities. Such fees are being amortized to interest
expense over the five-year term of the term loan facility. The five-year term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments through September2011.
Amounts outstanding under the term loan bear interest at a floating rate equal to the London
Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus a spread of 0625% to 1375% 545% at December31, 2007. 57 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued At December31, 2007 and 2006, $0 and $15,000,000, respectively, was outstanding under our
$75,000,000 revolving line of credit. Amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit bear
interest, at our option, at the prime rate or a
floating rate equal to a LIBOR based rate plus a rate advance fee of 0625% to 1375%
depending on the level of our leverage ratio 725% and 545% per annum, respectively, at December
31, 2007. In addition, we pay a commitment fee of 015% on the unused portion of the line.
Because we generally use this line for short-term borrowing needs, our borrowings are generally at
the prime rate and amounts outstanding are recorded as current liabilities. The credit facility
expires on September7, 2011. At December31, 2007, $75,000,000 was available under the line of
credit. The revolving line of credit also has a feature which allows us to increase the
availability on the line of credit by $37,500,000, upon request. We do not pay any fees on the
increased availability under the line until we activate the additional credit. We have an agreement to sell receivables periodically to a special purpose accounts receivable
and financing entity the SPE, which is exclusively engaged in purchasing receivables from us.
The SPE is a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote entity that we have included in our consolidated
financial statements. The SPE funds its purchases by selling undivided interests in up to
$225,000,000 of eligible trade accounts receivable to a multi-seller conduit administered by an
independent financial institution. The sales to the conduit do not qualify for sale treatment
under SFAS No140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment
of Liabilities, as we maintain effective control over the receivables that are sold. Accordingly,
the receivables remain recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. At December31, 2007 and 2006,
the SPE owned $396,126,000 and $397,123,000, respectively, of receivables recorded at fair value
and included in our consolidated balance sheets, of which $198,599,000 and $215,307,000,
respectively, was eligible for funding. The financing facility expires September7, 2009.
Interest is payable monthly, and the interest rate at December31, 2007 on borrowed funds was 587%
per annum, including the 055% commitment fee on the total $225,000,000 facility. We also pay a
0225% usage fee on the unused balance. During the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, our
weighted average interest rate per annum and weighted average borrowings under the facility were
63% and $123,097,000 and 57% and $63,948,000, respectively. At December31, 2007, $52,599,000
was available under the facility. Our financing facilities contain various covenants customary for transactions of this type,
including the requirement that we comply with maximum leverage and minimum fixed charge ratio
requirements and meet monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. If we fail to comply
with these covenants, the lenders would be able to demand payment within a specified period of
time. As of December31, 2007, we failed to comply with a covenant, as definedinour accounts
receivable securitization financing facility agreement, thatrequires us tohave no more than a
certain percentage of aged receivablesas compared to total receivables. In January2008, we
amended our securitization facility, effective December31, 2007, to change the definition of the
covenant, including an amendmentto the definition of how the covenant is calculated and its
maximum limit. At December31, 2007, we were in compliance with the amended terms. 7 Share Repurchase Program On December5, 2005, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000,000 of
our common stock. During the year ended December31, 2007, we purchased 1,955,646 shares on the
open market at an average price of $2557 per share, which represented the full amount authorized
under the repurchase program. All shares repurchased have been retired. On November13, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional
$50,000,000 of our common stock. There were no repurchases under this new program as of December
31, 2007. 8 Leases We have several non-cancelable operating leases with third parties, primarily for
administrative and distribution center space and computer equipment. Our facilities leases
generally provide for periodic rent increases and many contain escalation clauses and renewal
options. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Rental expense
for these third-party operating leases was $13,343,000, $9,491,000 and $7,267,000 for the years
ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and is included in selling and administrative
expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. 58 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

9 Severance, Restructuring and Acquisition Integration Activities Severance Costs Expensed in 2007 During the year ended December31, 2007, North America, EMEA and APAC recorded severance
expense of $2,960,000, $177,000 and $64,000, respectively, primarily associated with the retirement
of our chief financial officer. In connection with our chief financial officers retirement, we
agreed to provide him with payments and benefits consistent with those required for termination
without cause under his existing employment agreement, including a lump sum severance payment equal
to two times his base salary plus two times his 2006 bonus. The total severance amount related to
this retirement of $2,842,000 also includes non-cash stock-based compensation expense for a 90-day
extension of the post termination exercise period for stock options. Of the severance amounts
expensed in 2007, EMEA paid $177,000 during 2007. All other amounts are expected to be paid during
2008. Acquisition-Related Costs Capitalized in 2006 as a Cost of Acquisition of Software Spectrum We recorded $9,738,000 of employee termination benefits and $1,676,000 of facility based costs
in connection with the integration of Software Spectrum. These costs were accounted for under EITF
Issue No95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with Purchase Business Combinations, and
were based on the integration plans that were committed to by management. Accordingly, these costs

$2,724,000 is expected to be paid after 2008 and is therefore included in other liabilities
long-term. Severance Costs Expensed in 2006 During the year ended December31, 2006, North America and EMEA recorded severance expense of
$508,000 and $221,000, respectively, associated with the elimination of Insight positions as part
of our Software Spectrum integration plan and expense reduction plans. These amounts had all been
paid as of December31, 2006. 59 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

restructuring costs of $7,458,000, of which $6,447,000 represented the present value of the
remaining lease obligations on the previously vacated office property and $1,011,000 represented
duplicate rent expense for the new facility for the last half of 2005. The following table details the changes in this liability during the year ended December31,

As of December31, 2007, we have U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards NOLs of
$509,000 that begin to expire in 2008 and will fully expire in 2027. We also have NOLs from
various non-U.S. jurisdictions of $58,678,000. While the majority of the non-U.S. NOLs have no
expiration date, $512,000 will begin to expire in 2016 and will fully expire in 2017. In addition,
we have a foreign tax credit carryforward of $5,081,000 that begins to expire in 2015 and will
fully expire in 2017. On the basis of currently available information, we have provided valuation allowances for
certain of our deferred tax assets where we believe it is likely that the related tax benefits will
not be realized. At December31, 2007, our valuation allowances totaled $19,975,000, representing
all of our U.S. state NOLs, a portion of our non-U.S. NOLs, depreciation allowances, and a U.S.
deferred tax asset related to Software Spectrum foreign branches. In the future, if we determine
that additional realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not, the reversal of
the related valuation allowance will reduce income tax expense by $11,103,000 and will reduce
goodwill related to the Software Spectrum acquisition by $8,872,000. However, upon the January1,
2009 adoption of SFAS No141R, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax
uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense including those
associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No141R. At December
31, 2006, our valuation allowances totaled $19,830,000, representing all of our U.S. state NOLs, a
portion of our non-U.S. NOLs, depreciation allowances, and a U.S. deferred tax asset related to
Software Spectrum foreign branches. We believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be
generated as a result of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies, together with the tax
effects of deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover our remaining deferred tax
assets. In the future, if we determine that realization of the remaining deferred tax asset is not
more likely than not, we will need to increase our valuation allowance and record additional income
tax expense. The following table summarizes the change in the valuation allowance in thousands

Tax benefits of $1,948,000, $390,000 and $1,161,000 in the years ended December31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock
programs were applied to stockholders equity. Various taxing jurisdictions are examining our tax returns for various tax years. Although
the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the ultimate
resolution of these examinations will not result in a material adverse effect to our financial
position or results of operations. FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of
FASB Statement No109 FIN 48, requires that companies recognize the effect of a tax position
in their consolidated financial statements if there is a greater likelihood than not of the
position being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the position. We adopted the
provisions of FIN 48 effective January1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in no cumulative
effect adjustment to our retained earnings. However, in order to conform to the balance sheet
presentation requirements of FIN 48, we classified certain unrecognized tax benefits on our balance
sheet from current assets to non-current assets. 62 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued As of January1, 2007 the date we adopted FIN 48 and December31, 2007, we had approximately
$10,300,000 and $13,500,000, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits. Of these amounts,
approximately $1,500,000 and $2,600,000, respectively, relate to accrued interest. A

Our policy to classify interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions as a
component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings did not change as a
result of implementing the provisions of FIN 48. As of December31, 2007, if recognized, $2,200,000 of the liability associated with uncertain
tax positions would affect our effective tax rate. The remaining $11,300,000 balance arose from
business combinations that, if recognized, ultimately would be recorded as an adjustment to
goodwill or a receivable with no effect on our effective tax rate. However, upon adoption of SFAS
No141R on January1, 2009, any reversal of a valuation allowance established in purchase
accounting will be a benefit to earnings. We do not believe there will be any changes over the
next twelve months that would have a material effect on our effective tax rate. Various subsidiaries, including all U.S. companies, are currently under audit for various tax
years between 2002 and 2005. It is reasonably possible that the examination phase of some of these
audits may conclude in the next twelve months, and the related unrecognized tax benefits for
certain tax positions will significantly decrease. However, based on the status of the
examinations, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made at this time. We, including our subsidiaries, file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and
many state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the U.S., federal income tax returns for 2004
and 2005 are currently under examination. Any subsequent years remain open to examination. For
U.S. state and local as well as non-U.S. jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally varies
between three and ten years. 12 Stock Based Compensation On January1, 2006, we adopted SFAS No123 revised 2004, Share Based Payment SFAS No.
123R, which requires stock-based compensation to be measured based on the fair value of the award
on the date of grant and the corresponding expense to be recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. In March2005, the SEC issued
SAB No107 Share Based Payment SAB No107, relating to SFAS No123R. We have applied the
provisions of SAB No107 in our adoption of SFAS No123R. We adopted SFAS No123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method,
the provisions of SFAS No123R apply to all awards granted or modified after the date on which we
adopted SFAS No123R, and compensation expense must be recognized for any unvested stock option
awards outstanding based upon the fair value used in determining our pro forma disclosures under
FASB Statement No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123. We have not
restated prior periods for the adoption of SFAS No123R. We have recorded stock-based
compensation expense in prior periods related to the amortization of the fair value of restricted
stock awards over their respective vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is classified
in the same line item of the consolidated statements of earnings as other payroll-related expenses
for the specific employee. 63 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

Recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Company Plans On October1, 2007 Insights Board of Directors approved the 2007 Omnibus Plan the 2007
Plan, and the 2007 Plan became effective when it was approved by Insights stockholders at the
annual meeting on November12, 2007. The 2007 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee
of Insights Board of Directors, and except as provided below, the Compensation Committee has the
exclusive authority to administer the 2007 Plan, including the power to determine eligibility, the
types of awards to be granted, the price and the timing of awards. Under the 2007 Plan, the
Compensation Committee may delegate some of its authority to our Chief Executive Officer to grant
awards to individuals other than individuals who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act. Teammates,
officers and members of the Board of Directors are eligible for awards under the 2007 Plan, and
consultants and independent contractors are also eligible if they provide bona fide services to
Insight that are not related to capital raising or promoting or maintaining a market for Insights
stock. The 2007 Plan allows for awards of options, stock appreciation rights SARs, restricted
stock, restricted stock units RSUs, performance awards as well as grants of cash awards. A total
of 4,250,000 shares of stock are reserved for awards issued under the 2007 Plan. As of December
31, 2007, 4,032,500 shares of stock were available for grant under the 2007 Plan. 64 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued In October1997, the stockholders approved the establishment of the 1998 Long-Term Incentive
Plan the 1998 LTIP for our officers, teammates, directors, consultants and independent
contractors. The 1998 LTIP authorized grants of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock
options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted common stock and
performance-based awards. In 2000, the stockholders approved an amendment to the 1998 LTIP
increasing the number of shares eligible for awards to 6,000,000 and allowing our Board of
Directors to reserve which they have done additional shares such that the number of shares of
common stock available for grant under the 1998 LTIP and any of our other option plans, plus the
number of options to acquire shares of common stock granted but not yet exercised, or in the case
of restricted stock, granted but not yet vested, under the 1998 LTIP and any of our other option
plans, shall not exceed 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock at the time of
calculation of the additional shares. Upon stockholder approval of the 2007 Plan in November2007,
as discussed above, there will be no more grants under the 1998 LTIP. In September1998, we established the 1998 Employee Restricted Stock Plan the 1998 Employee
RSP for our teammates. The total number of restricted common stock shares available for grant
under the 1998 Employee RSP was 562,500. There were no grants of restricted common stock under
this plan during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Upon stockholder approval of
the 2007 Plan in November2007, as discussed above, there will be no more grants under the 1998
Employee RSP. In December1998, we established the 1998 Officer Restricted Stock Plan the 1998 Officer
RSP for our officers. The total number of restricted common stock shares available for grant
under the 1998 Officer RSP was 56,250. There were no grants of restricted common stock under this
plan during the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. Upon stockholder approval of the
2007 Plan in November2007, as discussed above, there will be no more grants under the 1998 Officer
RSP. In September1999, we established the 1999 Broad Based Employee Stock Option Plan the 1999
Broad Based Plan for our teammates. The total number of stock options initially available for
grant under the 1999 Broad Based Plan was 1,500,000; provided, however, that no more than 20% of
the shares of stock available under the 1999 Broad Based Plan may be awarded to the officers of the
Company. Upon stockholder approval of the 2007 Plan in November2007, as discussed above, there
will be no more grants under the 1999 Broad Based Plan. Accounting for Stock Options Before SFAS No123R Implementation Prior to our adoption of SFAS No123R, we applied the intrinsic value-based method of
accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees APB No25 and related interpretations to account for our fixed-plan stock
options. Under this method, compensation expense was recorded on the date of grant only if the
current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. SFAS No123 established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based
method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. Pro forma expense was presented
in our disclosures using the accelerated vesting methodology of FASB Interpretation No28
Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. To
determine the pro forma expense, we valued our stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Our determination of fair value of stock options on the
date of grant using an option-pricing model was affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions
regarding a number of subjective variables. These variables include   
assumptions related to the expected life of the options, which were based on
evaluations of historical and expected future employee exercise behavior   
the risk-free interest rate, which was based on the U.S. Treasury rates at the date of
grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life at the grant date; and   
the historical price volatility of our stock, which was used as the basis for the
expected volatility assumption. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value options granted during
the year ended December31, 2005 were

Consistent with SFAS No123R and SAB No107, we considered the historical volatility of our
stock price in determining our expected volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is
based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the stock options. The expected
life of stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to
remain outstanding calculated using the simplified method as prescribed in SAB No107. For the years ended December31, 2007 and 2006, we recorded in continuing operations
stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, net of forfeitures, of $3,435,000 and
$8,145,000, respectively. As of December31, 2007, total compensation cost related to nonvested
stock options not yet recognized is $1,701,000, which is expected to be recognized over the next
083years on a weighted-average basis. Included in the amount for the year ended December31, 2007 is $366,000 of cash payments made
in May through August2007 to teammates whose stock options expired during the period that
registration statements for our stock plans were suspended as a result of the delay in the filing
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December31, 2006 and $136,000 of cash
payments to be made to teammates pursuant to a formal Tender Offer the Tender Offer which
allowed teammates to avoid adverse tax consequences under IRC Section409A by amending certain
options that had been retroactively priced. A total of 63 teammates participated in the Tender
Offer. Pursuant to the Tender Offer, the exercise price per share in effect for each tendered
option was amended to the fair market value per share of our common stock on the measurement date
determined for that option for financial accounting purposes. Each participant who had an option
with an exercise price that was amended also became entitled to receive in early 2008 a special
cash payment with respect to that option to compensate them for the spread lost in the amendment.
The amount of the cash payment for each eligible option was calculated by multiplying ithe
amount by which the new exercise price of the option was higher than the exercise price per share
previously in effect for that option, times iithe number of shares of our common stock that the
holder could buy under that option. During 2007, we also recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense for a 90-day
extension of the post termination exercise period for stock options related to the retirement of
our former chief financial officer. The modification expense of $186,000 was recorded in severance
and restructuring expenses. We used the criteria in SFAS No123R to calculate and establish the beginning balance of the
additional paid-in capital pool APIC pool related to the tax effects of employee stock-based
compensation and to determine the subsequent effect on the APIC pool and consolidated statements of
cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that were outstanding
upon adoption of SFAS No123R. 66 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

Accounting for Restricted Stock We have issued shares of restricted common stock and RSUs as incentives to certain officers
and teammates. We recognize compensation expense associated with the issuance of such shares and
RSUs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for each respective share and RSU. The total
compensation expense associated with restricted stock represents the value based upon the number of
shares or RSUs awarded multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant.
Recipients of restricted stock shares are entitled to receive any dividends declared on our common
stock and have voting rights, regardless of whether such shares have vested. Recipients of RSUs do
not have voting or dividend rights until the vesting conditions are satisfied and shares are
released. 67 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued Starting in 2006, we have elected to primarily issue service-based and performance-based RSUs
instead of stock options and restricted stock shares. The number of RSUs ultimately awarded under
the performance-based RSUs will vary based on whether we achieve certain financial results. We
will record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of
RSUs that will be issued under the grants of performance-based RSUs. Additionally, the
compensation expense is adjusted for our estimate of forfeitures. For the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded in continuing operations
stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock shares
and RSUs of $8,109,000, $5,293,000 and $745,000, respectively. As of December31, 2007, total
compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock shares and RSUs not yet recognized is
$18,274,000, which is expected to be recognized over the next year on a weighted-average basis. The following table summarizes our restricted stock activity, including restricted stock
shares and RSUs, during the year ended December31, 2007

The fair value of vested restricted stock shares and RSUs represents the
total pre-tax fair value, based on the closing
stock price on the day of vesting, which would have been received by holders of restricted
stock shares and RSUs had all such holders sold their underlying shares on that date. The
aggregate intrinsic value for vested restricted stock shares and RSUs during 2006 was $1,604,270.   b
The aggregate fair value of the nonvested restricted stock shares and the RSUs
expected to vest represents the total pre-tax fair value, based on our closing stock price
of $1824 as of December31, 2007, which would have been received by holders of restricted
stock shares and RSUs had all such holders sold their underlying shares on that date. 13 Benefit Plans We have adopted a defined contribution benefit plan the Defined Contribution Plan which
complies with section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. We currently match 25% of the
teammates pre-tax contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation per pay period.
During 2006, the termination of all Direct Alliance participants constituted a partial plan
termination in which all Direct Alliance participants were fully vested in all company match
amounts. The acquisition of Software Spectrum in 2006 resulted in approximately 800 new employees
that are eligible for the Defined Contribution Plan. Contribution expense under this plan,
including amounts recorded in discontinued operations, was $1,691,000, $2,230,000 and $1,467,000
for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During 2007, we established the Insight Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan Deferred
Compensation Plan which will be effective beginning January1, 2008. The Deferred Compensation
Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan maintained primarily to provide deferred
compensation benefits for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as defined
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The Deferred Compensation Plan
permits participants voluntarily to defer receipt of compensation. Participants earn a rate of
return on their deferred amounts based on their selection from a variety of independently managed
funds. We do not provide a guaranteed rate of return on these deferred amounts. The rate of
return realized depends on the participants fund selections and market performance of these funds.
The Deferred Compensation Plan was adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee and ratified
by the Board of Directors. 68 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 14 Stockholder Rights Agreement On December14, 1998, each stockholder of record received one Preferred Share Purchase Right
Right for each outstanding share of common stock owned. Each Right entitles stockholders to
buy 00148 of a share of our SeriesA Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $8888. The Rights
will be exercisable if a person or group acquires 15% or more of our common stock or announces a
tender offer for 15% or more of our common stock. However, should this occur, the Right will
entitle its holder to purchase, at the Rights exercise price, a number of shares of common stock
having a market value at the time of twice the Rights exercise price. Rights held by the 15% holder will become void
and will not be exercisable to purchase shares at the bargain purchase price. If we are acquired
in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person acquires 15% or more of our
common stock, each Right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the Rights then current exercise
price, a number of the acquiring companys common shares having a market value at the time of twice
the Rights exercise price. On January11, 2008, the Board of Directors resolved to allow the
current stockholder rights plan to expire in accordance with its terms on December14, 2008. 15 Commitments and Contingencies Contractual We have entered into a sponsorship agreement through 2013 with the Valley of the Sun Bowl
Foundation, d/b/a Insight Bowl, which is the not-for-profit entity that conducts the Insight Bowl
post-season intercollegiate football game. We have committed to pay an aggregate amount of
approximately $8,400,000 through 2013 for sponsorship arrangements, ticket purchases and
miscellaneous expenses. We have committed to pay the Arizona Cardinals an aggregate amount of approximately $8,800,000
through February2014 for advertising and marketing events at the University of Phoenix stadium. In July2007, we signed a Statement of Work with Wipro Limited Wipro to assist us in
integrating our hardware, services and software distribution operations in the U.S., Canada, EMEA
and APAC on mySAP. At December31, 2007, under that Statement of Work, we had a commitment of
approximately $14,350,000 based on certain milestones to be reached in 2008 and 2009, assuming that
the projects described in the Statement of Work were to proceed to completion without variation or
early termination. Pursuant to a termination for convenience clause, we have served an early
termination notice and are negotiating a new scope of work with Wipro. In the ordinary course of business, we issue performance bonds to secure our performance under
certain contracts or state tax requirements. As of December31, 2007, we had approximately
$794,000 of performance bonds outstanding. These bonds are issued on our behalf by a surety
company on an unsecured basis; however, if the surety company is ever required to pay out under the
bonds, we have contractually agreed to reimburse the surety company. Employment Contracts We have employment contracts with certain officers and management teammates under which
severance payments would become payable and accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation would
occur in the event of specified terminations without cause or terminations under certain
circumstances after a change in control. If such persons were terminated without cause or under
certain circumstances after a change of control, and the severance payments under the current
employment agreements were to become payable, the severance payments would generally range from
three months of the teammates salary up to two times the teammates annual salary and bonus. Guaranties In the ordinary course of business, we may guarantee the indebtedness of our subsidiaries to
vendors and clients. We have not recorded specific liabilities for these guaranties in the
consolidated financial statements because we have recorded the underlying liabilities associated
with the guaranties. In the event we are required to perform under the related contracts, we
believe the cost of such performance would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position or results of operations. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may
agree to indemnify either our client or a third-party service provider in the arrangement from
certain losses incurred relating to services performed on our behalf or for losses arising from
defined events, which may include litigation or claims relating to past performance. These
arrangements include, but are not limited to, our indemnification of our officers and directors to
the maximum extent under the laws of the State of Delaware, the indemnification of our landlords
for certain claims arising from our use of leased facilities, and the indemnification of the
lenders that provide our credit facilities for certain claims arising from their extension of
credit to us. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.
Management believes that payments, if any, related to these indemnifications are not probable at
December31, 2007 and, if incurred, would not be material. Accordingly, we have not accrued any
liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements. 69 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued In connection with our sale of Direct Alliance in June2006, the sale agreement contains
certain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we are required to indemnify the buyer for a
limited period of time for liabilities, losses or expenses arising out of breaches of covenants and
certain breaches of representations and warranties relating to the condition of the business prior
to and at the time of sale. Management believes that payments related to these indemnifications,
if any, are not probable at December31, 2007 and, if incurred, would not be material. The sale agreement for our sale of PC Wholesale in March2007 contains certain indemnification
provisions pursuant to which we are required to indemnify the buyer for a limited period of time
for liabilities, losses or expenses arising out of breaches of covenants and certain breaches of
representations and warranties relating to the condition of the business prior to and at the time
of sale. Management believes that payments related to these indemnifications, if any, are not
probable at December31, 2007 and, if incurred, would not be material. Legal Proceedings We are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business,
including preference payment claims asserted in client bankruptcy proceedings, claims of alleged
infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, claims of
alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws
and regulations. In accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No5, we make a
provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly
and are adjusted to reflect the effects of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal
counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular claim. Although litigation is
inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any probable and
estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that the results of our operations or cash flows
could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the resolution of a legal
proceeding. Legal expenses related to defense, negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of
outside legal counsel are expensed as incurred. In October2006, we received a letter of informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain
documents relating to our historical stock option grants and practices. We have cooperated with
the SEC and will continue to do so. We cannot predict the outcome of this inquiry. Software Spectrum, Inc., as successor to CST, is party to litigation brought in the Belgian
courts regarding a dispute over the terms of a tender awarded by the Belgian Ministry of Defence
MOD in November2000. In February2001, CST brought a breach of contract suit against MOD in
the Court of First Instance in Brussels and claimed breach of contract damages in the amount of
approximately $150,000. MOD counterclaimed against CST for cost to cover in the amount of
approximately $2,700,000, and, in July2002, CST added a Belgian subsidiary of Microsoft as a
defendant. We believe that MODs counterclaims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending the
claim. We cannot make an estimate of the possible range of loss, if any, related to this
claim. Contingencies Related to Third-Party Review From time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We
are also subject to various governmental, client and vendor audits. We continually assess whether
or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of
SFAS No5. Where appropriate, we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the consolidated
financial statements. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of
operations and our cash flows. 70 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

- Includes $7,206,000 resulting from the Software Spectrum acquisition. 17 Segment and Geographic Information We operate in three reportable geographic operating segments: North America; EMEA; and APAC.
Currently, our offerings in North America and the United Kingdom include brand-name IT hardware,
software and services. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA segment and in APAC currently
only include software and select software-related services. We have not disclosed net sales amounts
by product or service type for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, as it is
impracticable for us to do so. SFAS No131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information
SFAS No131, requires disclosures of certain information regarding operating segments,
products and services, geographic areas of operation and major clients. The method for determining
what information to report under SFAS No131 is based upon the management approach, or the way
that management organizes the operating segments within a company, for which separate financial
information is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM in deciding how
to allocate resources. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. All intercompany transactions are eliminated upon consolidation, and there are no differences
between the accounting policies used to measure profit and loss for our segments and on a
consolidated basis. Net sales are defined as net sales to external clients. None of our clients
exceeded ten percent of consolidated net sales for the year ended December31, 2007. A portion of our operating segments selling and administrative expenses arise from shared
services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to them in order to realize
economies of scale and to use resources efficiently. These expenses, collectively identified as
corporate charges, include senior management expenses, internal audit, legal, tax, insurance
services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to our
operating segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we considered to be a
reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the
operating segments. 71 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

$470,239,000 and $24,020,000, respectively, attributed to the United Kingdom. Net sales by
geographic area are presented by attributing net sales to external customers based on the domicile
of the selling location. Although we are affected by the international economic climate, management does not believe
material credit risk concentration existed at December31, 2007. We monitor our clients financial
condition and do not require collateral. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses
related to accounts receivable from any individual client or similar groups of clients. 18 Non-Operating Income Expense, Net Non-operating incomeexpense, net consists primarily of interest income, interest expense
and foreign currency exchange gainslosses. Interest income was generated through short-term
investments. Interest expense primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities. Net
foreign currency exchange gainslosses consist primarily of net foreign currency transaction
gains or losses for intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. Other
expense, net, consists primarily of bank fees associated with our financing facilities and cash
management. 19 Discontinued Operations PC Wholesale On March1, 2007, we completed the sale of PC Wholesale, a division of our North America
operating segment that sells to other resellers. The sale of PC Wholesale is consistent with our
strategic plan as we concluded that selling IT products to other resellers is not a core element of
our growth strategy. The transaction generated proceeds of
$28,631,000. In the fourth quarter of 2007, we resolved certain
post-closing contingencies and recognized an additional gain on the sale
of PC Wholesale of $350,000, $264,000 net of taxes. This resolution
will require a cash payment of $900,000 to be made in 2008. In accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS No144, we have reported the results of operations of PC Wholesale as a
discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. We
did not allocate interest, general corporate overhead expense or non-specific partner funding to
the discontinued operation. PC Wholesales accounts receivable and inventory was approximately
$15,000,000 and $6,000,000, respectively, at December31, 2006. Other assets and liabilities of PC
Wholesale included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2006 were not material. 73 Table of Contents INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

Direct Alliance On June30, 2006, we completed the sale of 100% of the outstanding stock of Direct Alliance
for a purchase price of $46,500,000, subject to a working capital adjustment. The purchase price
did not include real estate and intercompany receivables, which had an estimated fair value of
$49,400,000 book value of $43,237,000 and were distributed to us immediately prior to closing.
In addition to payment of the purchase price, the buyer is obligated to make a one-time bonus
payment to us if Direct Alliance achieves certain gross profit levels for the year ended December
31, 2006 Earn Out. Additionally, the buyer is entitled to a claw back of the purchase price of
up to $5,000,000 if certain Direct Alliance client contracts are not renewed on terms prescribed in
the sale agreement. The Company is in the process of negotiating the final resolution of the Earn
Out and the claw back, which may result in additional gain recorded on the sale. Additionally, on
June30, 2006, we paid $2,696,000 to the holders of 1,997,500 exercised Direct Alliance stock
options. If additional gain is recorded on the sale as a result of final resolution of the Earn
Out and clawback, additional amounts will also be paid to the holders of 1,997,500 exercised Direct
Alliance stock options. In accordance with SFAS No144, we have reported the results of operations of Direct Alliance
as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented.
We did not allocate interest or general corporate overhead expense to the discontinued operation. On June30, 2006, in connection with the sale of Direct Alliance, we entered into a

21 Subsequent Event On January24, 2008, we announced the signing of an agreement and plan of merger to acquire
privately-held Calence for a purchase price of $125,000,000. Up to an additional $35,000,000 in
purchase price consideration may be due if certain performance targets are achieved over the next
four years. To facilitate the acquisition of Calence, we have received a commitment from a
financial institution to provide up to $275,000,000 in new credit to finance the acquisition and
for general corporate purposes. It is contemplated that the new revolving facility will be funded
through a syndicate of banks and will replace our current $75,000,000 revolving credit facility and
our $75,000,000 term loan.
