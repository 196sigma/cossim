REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To Transaction Network Services, Inc.:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Transaction
Network Services, Inc. a Delaware corporation and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1998 and 1997, and the related statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1998. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Transaction Network
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

TRANSACTION NETWORK SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Transaction Network Services, Inc. the Company or TNS was incorporated
in August 1990 to build and operate a communications network focused on the
network services needs of the POS Point-of-Sale/ Point-of-Service transaction
processing industry through its POS division. In September 1998, the Company
significantly expanded its POS network services business through a $643 million
acquisition of the rights to provide services under certain customer service
contracts relating to AT Corp. Transaction Access Service TAS.
Additionally, in 1998, the Company expanded the service offerings of its POS
division through the acquisitions of certain assets of Suntech Processing
Systems, LLC Suntech and OmniLink Communications Corporation OmniLink.
Suntech proprietary host-interface processing technology allows for leased
line automated teller machines ATM to be converted into dial-up ATM.
OmniLink develops, manufactures and markets modems for electronic commerce,
Internet access, telecommuting and advanced office communications.
In June 1994, the Company acquired Fortune Telecommunications, Inc. FTI
of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, which formed the Company Telecom Services Division
TSD. TSD provides customers in the telecommunications industry with
telephone call fraud control, billing validation and other services.
In March 1997, the TNS Financial Services Division was created to serve the
data communications needs of the financial services industry. In January 1999,
the Company acquired Transline Communications, Inc. Transline in a
transaction structured to be accounted for as a pooling of interests.
Transline core business is comprised of voice and data services provided to
financial institutions for futures, options, and commodities trading.
In June 1996, the Company formed Transaction Network Services Limited
TNSL, a majority-owned subsidiary. TNSL provides POS network services in
Ireland and serves as TNS' European technology and marketing center to support
current and future European operations. In October 1997, through TNSL, the
Company acquired a majority interest in Pronoma Systems AB which has been
renamed Transaction Network Services TNS AB TNSAB and operates as a TNSL
subsidiary located in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1998 the Company, through
TNSL, acquired a 50% interest in ATOS Ireland Limited Atos. Atos has been
renamed Switchtran Limited Switchtran and provides processing services,
primarily for cash withdrawals, for a network of ATM located throughout
Ireland. In September 1998, the Company entered into a 60% owned joint venture
in the United Kingdom UK named Transaction Network Services UK Limited
TNSUK. TNSUK operates as a TNS subsidiary located in Sheffield, England. In
November 1998, the Company, through TNSL, formed Transaction Network Services,
Societe Anonyme. TNSSA. TNSSA operates as a TNS subsidiary located in Paris,
France. In January 1999, the Company acquired Transline Ltd.--a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Transline, located in London, England. TNSL, TNSAB, TNSUK, TNSSA
and Transline, Ltd. utilize the Company network technology to provide POS and
other transaction services in their respective countries.
The Company currently operates four segments or divisions: 1 the POS
Division which includes the Company TransXpress-Registered Trademark- network
services for the POS transaction processing industry, 2 the Telecom Services
Division TSD which includes FTI CARD*TEL-Registered Trademark- telephone
call billing validation and fraud control services and other services targeting
primarily the telecommunications industry, 3 the Financial Services Division
FSD which provides the TNS FastLink-Registered Trademark- Data Service and
other transaction oriented trading applications primarily to the financial
services industry, and 4 the International Systems Division ISD which
markets the Company products and services internationally.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated in consolidation.
The majority of the Company revenues are derived from the transmission of
POS transactions predominantly credit and debit card transactions, that are
processed electronically by a small number of third party POS
43
transaction processors. The Company TransXpress-Registered Trademark- network
services implement proprietary technology that provides a communications link
between the merchant site and the transaction processor. The Company markets its
TransXpress-Registered Trademark-network services directly to third party POS
transaction processors, who in turn resell the Company network services as a
part of the processors' own services.
The Company CARD*TEL-Registered Trademark- telecommunications services
utilize proprietary fraud control technology and databases to provide real-time
telephone call billing validation and fraud control services to the
telecommunications industry, including long distance telephone companies,
operator services providers, information services providers and private pay
telephone companies.
The TNS FastLink-Registered Trademark- Data Service includes primarily
electronic communication of indications of interest, orders and execution
reports that are normally phoned between traders or transmitted via proprietary
systems over a secure TCP/IP network developed, operated and maintained by TNS.
The Company operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties
including, among others, reliance on major customers, rapidly changing
technology, the Year 2000, limited suppliers, current and potential competitors
with significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources,
government regulation and the ability to successfully integrate acquired
operations.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
DILUTED AND BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing
income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common
shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue
common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Options to purchase
79,800 shares of common stock in the price range of $2263 through $2550 per
share were outstanding during 1998 but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common shares.

RECENT AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Statement No. 130 Reporting Comprehensive Income. Statement No. 130 requires
the Company to present an aggregate amount of comprehensive income and the
components of other comprehensive income in its 1998 financial statements
and/or notes thereto. The Company adopted Statement No. 130 in 1998. In July
1997, the FASB issued Statement No. 131 Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information. Statement No. 131 requires the Company to
disclose segment information using a management approach beginning with its
44
December 31, 1998 financial statements. The Company adopted Statement No. 131 in
1998. In March 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position 98-1 Accounting for
the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, SOP
98-1. SOP 98-1 requires the Company to capitalize internal computer software
costs once certain capitalization criteria are met. SOP 98-1 is effective
January 1, 1999 and is applied to all projects in progress upon the initial
application of the SOP. A significant percentage of the Company historical
engineering and development expenses are costs that are now required to be
capitalized under SOP 98-1. Accordingly, the Company expects SOP 98-1 to have a
material impact by reducing the Company 1999 engineering and development
expenses. In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement No. 133 Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement No. 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments including
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. It requires
that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. The Company will be
required to adopt Statement No. 133 on January 1, 2000. Statement No. 133 will
not be applied retroactively to the financial statements of prior periods. The
Company has not yet determined the impact of adopting Statement No. 133.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company considers all securities purchased with an original maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company
determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of
purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. At
December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company marketable securities consisted
primarily of money market accounts classified as cash equivalents, U.S.
government and government agency securities, and investment grade corporate
bonds, all of which the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold
until maturity. These securities are reported at amortized cost. The contractual
maturities of held to maturity securities are all less than one year.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of each class of financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate
that value:
CURRENT ASSETS AND CURRENT LIABILITIES
The carrying amount approximated fair value because of the short maturity of
these instruments.
INVESTMENTS
At December 31, 1998, the fair values of marketable securities based on
quoted market prices on national exchanges approximated the carrying amounts.
Certain of the Company financial instruments included in investments have no
quoted market prices. The Company believes by reference to stated interest rates
and collateral held, the fair value of the assets would not differ materially
from their carrying values.
LONG-TERM DEBT
The fair value of the Company long-term debt is based upon quoted market
prices for the same and similar issues, giving consideration to quality,
interest rates, maturity and other characteristics. At December 31, 1998, the
fair value approximated the carrying amount since the interest rate will be
reset in May 1999.
CREDIT RISK
The Company assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of
cash equivalents, investments including non-marketable securities of
approximately $37 million, and accounts receivable. The Company places its
marketable security investments in instruments that meet high credit quality
standards as specified in the Company investment policy guidelines. Marketable
securities were approximately $27 million at December 31, 1998, all of which
mature in less than one year. The Company invests in non-marketable securities
after
45
consideration of the financial condition of the borrower and the overall
business relationship. Non-marketable securities were approximately $37 million
at December 31, 1998. Non-marketable securities mature on the following dates 300,000 in 1999, $350,000 in 2000, $150,000 in 2001, $600,000 in 2002 and $23
million in 2005. Accounts receivable consist of geographically dispersed
customers, and the Company has not experienced significant losses related to
uncollectible accounts from its POS, FSD or international customers. Revenues
from its telecommunications services customers are subject to a higher degree of
credit risk than is the case for the Company POS services customers. The
Company reserves for the credit risk associated with this customer base. The
allowance for doubtful accounts was $558,000 at December 31, 1998 and $530,000
at December 31, 1997. The Company 5 largest customers represented 44% of total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998.
LONG-LIVED ASSETS
The Company long-lived assets consist of network equipment and intangible
assets. The Company periodically reviews the value of its long-lived assets to
determine if an impairment has occurred. The Company considers expected cash
flows and estimated future operating results, trends, and other available
information in assessing whether the long-lived asset is impaired.
EQUIPMENT
Network and office equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation expense is
calculated using the straight-line method. Network equipment is depreciated over
estimated useful lives of three to seven years. Office equipment is depreciated
over estimated useful lives of three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the lesser of the useful life or the lease term.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets primarily consist of goodwill, contract rights,
non-compete agreements, and software. Intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over useful lives ranging from two to twenty years.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes services revenue as the related services are
performed. Advance payments for services are deferred and recognized as revenue
when earned. POS services revenue is derived primarily from the transmission
through the Company network of transaction information between merchant or
service provider POS terminals and transaction-processing computer centers. TSD
revenue consists primarily of fees charged on a per query basis to customers for
telephone call fraud-control and billing validation services. FSD revenue is
derived primarily from monthly recurring fees. International revenue consists
primarily of POS services revenue, royalties, software license fees and
equipment sales. Revenue from equipment sales is recognized upon shipment.
Revenue from software licenses is recognized ratably over the term of the
agreement. Revenue from royalties is recognized when earned.
COST OF NETWORK SERVICES
Cost of network services principally includes usage charges for data
transmission and database access, leased digital transmission capacity charges,
transmission capacity installation charges, activation charges, salaries,
equipment maintenance and other related network costs. These costs are expensed
by the Company as incurred. Depreciation expense on network equipment was
$5,367,000, $4,124,000 and $3,623,000 for the years ended December 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996, respectively, and is included in depreciation expense.
ENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditures for engineering and development activities are charged to
expense as incurred.
46
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under
Statement No. 109, deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon
the difference between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and
liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rate. Deferred income tax expense or
benefits are based upon the changes in the asset or liability from period to
period.
MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES
The Company has provided the minority shareholders of TNSL, TNSAB,
Switchtran and TNSUK the right to put their shares to the Company at the fair
value of the shares at the exercise date. The Company also has the right to call
the minority shares of TNSL, TNSAB and TNSUK at fair value. The put and call
provisions related to TNSL are exercisable beginning in 2000 and expire in 2007.
The put and call provisions related to TNSAB are exercisable beginning in 2001
and expire in 2003. The put provisions related to Switchtran are exercisable
between February 1, 1999 and March 31, 1999. The Switchtran put price was
approximately $20 million at December 31, 1998. The put and call provisions
related to TNSUK are exercisable beginning in 2003 and expire in 2005. Fair
value amounts for these puts and calls are not available as they represent an
interest in companies whose stock is not publicly traded.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform
with the current year presentation.
2. ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS:
AMNEX, INC.
On March 29, 1996, the Company completed an asset purchase from AMNEX, Inc.
AMNEX of AMNEX proprietary fraud-control system and related databases used
to provide fraud control and billing validation services. The transaction also
included a ten-year exclusive service agreement and other agreements. The
Company paid approximately $15 million in cash for these assets.
In December 1997, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with AMNEX
in exchange for certain revisions made to the exclusive service agreement. The
consulting agreement required an initial payment of approximately $180,000 and
monthly payments of approximately $33,000 through June 30, 2002. The consulting
agreement provided that, in the case of a material breach by AMNEX, the
remaining monthly payments become immediately due and payable as liquidated
damages. In May 1998, the Company delivered a notice of default to AMNEX for
non-payment of fees under the exclusive service agreement and consulting
agreement. On July 29, 1998, the Company filed arbitration proceedings with the
American Arbitration Association against AMNEX. In January 1999, prior to the
commencement of the arbitration proceedings, the parties entered into a
settlement agreement. The settlement agreement required AMNEX to pay $530,000 of
accounts receivable, which was collected in 1999. AMNEX further agreed to pay
the Company $17 million, with interest, in 24 equal monthly installments of
approximately $79,000 beginning in March 1999. The monthly payments are to be
made directly to the Company from AMNEX billing agent. As of December 31 1998,
the Company has net assets related to AMNEX of approximately $16 million,
including accounts receivable of approximately $530,000 and intangible assets of
approximately $11 million.
CONVERTIBLE DEBT
In July 1997, the Company obtained a five-year exclusive data services
agreement, a joint marketing agreement and invested $20 million in the form of
a subordinated convertible note with another company. Interest on the note is
payable each August, beginning in August 1998. Alternatively, under the terms of
the
47
note, the borrower may issue an additional note equal to the accrued interest on
terms and with rights identical to the original note. In August 1998, the
borrower issued a $300,000 note for the amount of interest accrued on the
original note. At any time, the Company may convert all or any portion of the
principal plus accrued interest into a minority interest in the customers'
common stock. The borrower may redeem up to 50% of the notes at any time up
until August 1999 at a specified annual internal rate of return. The notes
mature in August 2005, and as a result, the notes are recorded as long-term
investments. The notes are classified as available for sale securities due to
their conversion provisions. Fair value approximated carrying value at December
31, 1998.
TERM LOANS
In July 1997, the Company entered into a $250,000 secured term loan with a
customer. The Company also paid this customer $500,000 for a software license to
use the customer proprietary call monitoring and screening system and related
databases along with an option to purchase a minority interest in the customer.
Certain collateral secures the term loan, interest is payable monthly, and
principal payments are due in three annual payments on the next three loan
anniversary dates. In connection with the term loan, the Company signed a debt
subordination agreement with the customer senior creditor. In April 1998, the
Company received notice from the senior creditor that the borrower was in
default. Under the debt subordination agreement, the Company could not receive
payments from the customer for a specified period. Management is negotiating
terms for payment of the loan. In the event that the result of these
negotiations is unsatisfactory to management, the Company will consider all
options available under the loan and applicable law. Management believes that
these assets are recoverable through future cash flows. Any adjustment to the
book value of these assets will result in a non-cash accounting charge. At
December 31, 1998, there was $250,000 outstanding under this term loan.
In August 1997, the Company made a $500,000 secured term loan to a company.
Interest is payable monthly and principal was due in February 1998. The customer
repaid $100,000 of principal in 1997. In February 1998, the Company agreed to
amend the term loan to provide for equal monthly payments of principal and
interest over a 24-month period. At December 31, 1998, there was $260,000
outstanding under this term loan.
In December 1997, the Company executed a $450,000 secured term loan with a
customer. The principal balance included the conversion of approximately
$316,000 of accounts receivable. Interest is payable monthly beginning February
1998. Principal is payable in 36 monthly installments beginning January 2000.
Certain collateral, including the stock of the customer, secures the loan. At
December 31, 1998, there was $450,000 outstanding under this term loan.

In connection with the TAS acquisition, the Company entered into the
Revolver. The Revolver provides for unsecured LIBOR or base rate borrowings at
the Company option. A margin is added to the applicable LIBOR or base rate
based upon the Company ratio of total debt to annualized operating cash flow,
as defined. The interest rate at December 31, 1998 was 595% LIBOR plus 75
basis points and the weighted average interest rate was 623% for 1998. The
LIBOR loan outstanding at December 31, 1998, matures in May 1999. Interest on
LIBOR loans is paid at expiration or, for LIBOR loans with an original maturity
of greater than 90 days, both at 90 days from inception and on expiration.
Interest on base rate loans is paid on March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31. The Revolver matures in September 2001 and is subject to annual
renewals thereafter. Borrowings may be repaid at any time without penalty
subject to minimum repayment amounts. The Revolver includes a commitment fee
based upon the average unused balance. The Revolver also includes certain
financial and non-financial restrictive covenants including minimum operating
cash flow requirements and limitations on investments, other borrowings, capital
expenditures and acquisitions. Acquisitions are subject to pro-forma covenant
compliance. Due to market conditions subsequent to year-end, the Company and its
primary lender, agreed to temporarily reduce the maximum borrowing under the
Revolver from $75 million to $62 million until June 30, 1999, while the primary
lender seeks an additional bank to participate in the
50
syndication. Accordingly, the current amount available for additional borrowings
under the Revolver is approximately $27 million. Should an additional bank
elect to participate in the syndication, the Revolver will be increased to its
previous $75 million limitation, however, if an additional bank is not located,
the Revolver will be permanently reduced to $60 million.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In 1994, the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
Eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their base earnings toward the
semi-annual purchase of Common Stock. Under the terms of the plan, 250,000
shares of authorized Common Stock were reserved for purchase at 85% of the fair
market price at the beginning or end of each six-month offering period,
whichever is lower. During 1996, employees purchased 9,124 shares at $1218 per
share and 14,582 shares at $1020 per share. During 1997, employees purchased
11,265 shares at $1020 per share and 12,958 shares at $1094 per share. During
1998, employees purchased 9,870 shares at $1349 per share and 9,990 shares at
$1719 per share. The weighted average fair value for shares purchased under the
ESPP was $568 for 1998, $360 for 1997and $279 for 1996.
The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 123
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. If compensation cost for the
Company stock option and stock purchase plans had been determined based on the
fair value at the grant date for awards in 1998, 1997, and 1996 consistent with
the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company net earnings and earnings per
share would have been the pro forma amounts indicated below:
