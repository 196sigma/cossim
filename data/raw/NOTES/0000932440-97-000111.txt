24             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Board of Directors
TV Filme, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TV Filme,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years ended December 31, 1996. These financial
statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Company  management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
TV Filme, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the three years
ended December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.                         ERNST & YOUNG

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
A. COMPANY BACKGROUND
In connection with an initial public offering of its Common Stock the
Initial Public Offering, TV Filme, Inc. the Company was formed in April
1996 to become the holding company of and successor to ITSA-Intercontinental
Telecomunicacoes S.A. and its subsidiaries ITSA. The transfer of ITSA to the
Company has been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
ITSA was formed in May 1994 as a holding company for and successor to TV Filme
Servicos de Telecomunicacoes S.A. TVFSA. The transfer of TVFSA to ITSA has
been accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interests.
In connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company has entered
into a restructuring the Restructuring pursuant to which all of the
preferred stock of ITSA was converted into common stock of ITSA, based on the
conversion rates at the date of issuance of the preferred stock. Each share of
common stock of ITSA was exchanged for 1,844 shares of Common Stock of the
Company. As all of the preferred stock of ITSA has been converted and there were
no preferred dividends paid or due as a result of the conversion, all preferred
and common stock issuances of the predecessor companies have been reflected as
issuances of Common Stock of the Company. Prior to the consummation of the
Initial Public Offering and the Restructuring, TVFSA operated the Company
wireless cable system in Brasilia, and held the licenses to operate the
Company wireless cable systems in Brasilia, Goiania and Belem. ITSA owned
substantially all of TVFSA, TV Filme Goiania Servicos de Telecomunicacoes Ltda.
TV Filme Goiania and TV Filme Belem Servicos de Telecomunicacoes Ltda. TV
Filme Belem. Pursuant to the Restructuring, i 51% of the voting stock of
TVFSA was transferred to an entity, all of which is owned by certain existing
shareholders of ITSA who are Brazilian nationals, with ITSA retaining 49% of the
voting stock and 83% of the economic interests in TVFSA; ii the operating
assets of the wireless cable system of Brasilia were transferred from TVFSA to
TV Filme Brasilia Servicos de Telecomunicacoes Ltda. TV Filme Brasilia,
which is substantially owned by ITSA; and iii TVFSA has entered into various
agreements with ITSA and its subsidiaries pursuant to which, among other things,
TVFSA has authorized ITSA to operate the existing wireless cable systems under
its current licenses. Subsequent to the Restructuring and the Initial Public
Offering, the Company owns 100% of ITSA, which holds 49% of the voting stock and
83% of the economic interests of TVFSA and 100% of TV Filme Brasilia, TV Filme
Goiania and TV Filme Belem.
Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include
i TVFSA on a historical basis from inception through May 1994 and ii ITSA
and its subsidiaries on a historical basis since May 1994 as though they have
been part of the Company for all periods presented. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
The Company develops, owns and operates pay television systems in
mid-sized markets in Brazil. The Company has established wireless cable
operating systems in the cities of Brasilia, Goiania and Belem. Applications
have been made for the Company to operate systems in an additional 27 markets in
Brazil. Although the economic situation in Brazil has improved since July 1994,
when the government introduced the Real Plan, a return to high levels of
inflation and currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Company
operations.
B. METHOD OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States in
U.S. dollars. Amounts in Brazilian currency have been remeasured into U.S.
dollars in accordance with the methodology set forth in Statement of Financial
Accounting
30 Standards No. 52 as it applies to entities operating in highly inflationary
economies. Supplies, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and deferred
installation fees and the related income statement accounts are remeasured at
exchange rates in effect when the assets were acquired or the liabilities were
incurred. All other assets and liabilities are remeasured at year end exchange
rates, and all other income and expense items are remeasured at average exchange
rates prevailing during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are included in
exchange and translation gains losses.
C. NET LOSS PER SHARE
Net loss per share is calculated using the weighted average number of
shares of stock outstanding during the period together with the number of shares
issuable upon the exercise of options and warrants issued during the twelve
months prior to the filing of the Initial Public Offering. The computation of
fully diluted pro forma net loss per share of common stock was antidilutive;
therefore, the amounts reported for primary and fully diluted loss per share are
the same.
D. CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
E. SUPPLIES
Supplies are recorded at the lower of cost or market.
F. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company capitalizes
materials, subcontractor costs, labor and overhead incurred associated with
initial subscriber installations. The Company continues to depreciate the full
installation cost subsequent to any subscriber disconnections.
Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis using estimated useful
lives ranging from 5 to 10 years for buildings and leasehold improvements, 5
years for machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures and installation
costs.
G. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are comprised primarily of pay television licenses,
which are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 10 years.
Accumulated amortization at December 31, 1995 and 1996 was $131,000 and
$159,000, respectively.
H. REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenues from subscribers are recognized in the period service is
rendered. Installation fees are recognized as revenue to the extent of direct
selling costs incurred, with the remainder deferred and amortized to income over
a five year period.
I. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS
The Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $315,000 and
$666,000 at December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively. Charges to the allowance
during 1995 and 1996 were $0 and $945,000, respectively.                    31    J. STOCK OPTIONS
The Company accounts for stock options granted to employees in accordance
with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25. Under APB 25, because the exercise
price of the Company employee stock option grants is greater than or equal to
the market price on the date of grant, no compensation is recognized.
K. INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense approximates the amount of cash interest paid.
L. USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
M. RECLASSIFICATION
Certain 1994 and 1995 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
1996 presentation.
2. Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is comprised of the following at December
31                          1995     1996

1996, respectively.
3. Related Party Transactions
Substantially all programming is supplied by a subsidiary of Tevecap S.A.
Tevecap, a stockholder of the Company, pursuant to a programming contract.
Amounts paid to such affiliate in 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $178,000, $1,334,000
and $6,731,000, respectively, net of discounts on programming fees compared to
list prices. Such discounts were received during 1994 and the first ten months
of 1995, and in 1994 and 1995 were $340,000 and $539,000, respectively. No
discounts were received in 1996 and such discounts are not expected to recur.
The Company purchases from Tevecap a program guide which it distributes to its
subscribers monthly. Amounts paid to Tevecap in 1994, 1995 and 1996 were $0 113,000 and $750,000, respectively.                    32    Receivables  from Tevecap and Abril S.A.  Abril,  the majority
stockholder of Tevecap, bear interest at the Brazilian interbank rate CDI

in 1995.
In 1994, the Company purchased two licenses to operate wireless cable
systems from Abril for $400,000 each, payable in four equal annual installments,
which do not bear interest. Included in payables to affiliates at December 31,
1995 and 1996 is $600,000 and $400,000, respectively, related to this purchase.
Other payables to Abril and its affiliates bear interest at the CDI plus 08 which ranged from 324% to 441% per month. Interest expense to Abril and its
affiliates was $433,000 in 1996.
The Company  purchases  equipment  and supplies from vendors under

options were vested at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock at the
date of the 1995 grant was deemed to be $312,000 and, therefore, a charge for

Company, which amount has been included in selling, general and administrative
expenses.
5. Stock-Option Plan
In connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Board of Directors of
the Company adopted and the stockholders of the Company approved the 1996 Stock
Option Plan the Plan. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options to
officers, key employees, consultants and directors of the Company. The Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board and the total number of
shares of Common Stock for which options may be granted pursuant to the Plan is
936,432, subject to certain adjustments reflecting changes in the Company
capitalization. The Plan allows the granting of incentive stock options, which
may not have an exercise price below the greater of par value or the market
value on the date of grant, and non-qualified stock options, which have no
restrictions as to exercise price other than the exercise price cannot be below
par value. All options must be exercised no later than 10 years from the date of
grant. Options to purchase 407,000 shares of Common Stock were granted upon the
consummation of the Initial Public Offering, 297,000 of which are exercisable at
$1000 per share, and 110,000 of which are exercisable at $1100 per share, and
which generally vest 20% per year for five years beginning on the first
anniversary of consummation of the Initial Public Offering. Options to purchase
an additional 10,000 shares of Common Stock were granted in December 1996 at an
exercise price of $1175.
Pro forma information regarding net loss and loss per share has been
determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options under
the fair value method of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of
grant using a  Black-Scholes  option  pricing  model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 1996: risk-free interest rate of 63%, dividend
yield of 0%; volatility factor of the expected market price of the Common Stock
of 46; and a weighted-average expected life of the option of 75 years.
For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period. The Company
pro forma information for the year ended December 31, 1996 follows in thousands
of dollars            Pro forma net loss     $2,208
Pro forma loss per share   22    6. Long-term debt
On December 20, 1996, the Company issued $140 million principal amount of
12-7/8% Senior Notes due December 15, 2004 the Senior Notes. The proceeds of
the Senior Notes were loaned to ITSA and evidenced by an intercompany note.
Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each
year, commencing on June 15, 1997. Of the $140 million loaned to ITSA,
approximately $335 million was used to purchase government  securities,
scheduled interest and principal payments on which is in an amount sufficient to
provide for payment in full when due of the first four scheduled interest
payments on the Senior Notes. In connection with the transfer of the proceeds of
the Senior Notes to ITSA and remittance of reais to U.S. dollars, the Company
incurred exchange losses of approximately $600,000. This amount was reflected in
exchange and translation gain losses at December 31, 1996. Debt issuance costs
are capitalized and amortized over the period of the debt under the effective
yield method.
The Senior Notes are redeemable on or after December 15, 2000 at the
option of the Company, in whole or in part from time to time, at specified
redemption prices declining annually to 100% of the principal amount on or after
December 15, 2003, plus accrued interest. The Senior Notes contain certain
covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur
additional indebtedness and pay dividends or make certain other
34 distributions. Upon a change of control, the Company is required to make an
offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In
accordance with the covenants of the Senior Notes, at December 31, 1996, the
Company is unable to make any dividend payments.
The Company believes the recorded value of the Senior Notes approximates
the fair value at December 31, 1996.
7. Income Taxes
The reasons for the difference between total tax expense benefit and the
amount computed by applying the effective Brazilian tax rate to income before
income taxes are as follows                        1994   1995   1996
IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
Income taxes benefit at effective
Brazilian rate.  $249  $1,064  $ 613
Effect of monetary adjustments under
Brazilian tax law.  709   765     Nondeductible compensation expense.   --    150    78
Effect of change in tax rate.   --    267   232
Other    --    198     Increase decrease in valuation allowance.   460   316   767
Tax expense    --    --                                    The Company has not recognized any future income tax benefit for its net
operating loss carryforwards in excess of net deferred tax liabilities as it is
not assured that it will be able to realize a benefit for such losses in the
future. The net operating loss carryforwards amounted to $122 million at
December 31, 1996, of which approximately $12 million was attributable to TV
Filme Servicos. As a result of the Restructuring, the net operating loss
carryforwards of TV Filme Servicos, which is no longer a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company, are available only to offset its own income and are not
available to offset any profits generated by TV Filme and its consolidated
subsidiaries. Under Brazilian law, net operating losses may be carried forward
for an unlimited period of time. Use of these losses, however, is restricted to
30% of taxable income in a tax period.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The approximate effect of
temporary differences as of December 31, 1995 and 1996 is as follows                    35                              1995  1996

Effective January 1, 1996, the effective Brazilian tax rate declined from
48% to 305%. This has been reflected in the deferred tax assets and liabilities
at December 31, 1995. Effective January 1, 1997, the effective Brazilian tax
rate increased from 305% to 335%. This has been reflected in the deferred tax
assets and liabilities at December 31, 1996.
7. Commitments

transmission tower rental agreements. Rent expense amounted to approximately
$128,000, $1,395,000 and $2,062,000 for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995
and 1996, respectively. A substantial number of these rental agreements are
renewed on a continuous basis. The Company also has entered into various
