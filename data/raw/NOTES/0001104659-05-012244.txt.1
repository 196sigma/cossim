54 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING
FIRM 
We have completed an
integrated audit of Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.s 2004 consolidated financial
statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002 consolidated financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
United States. Our opinions, based on
our audits, are presented below.
Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under a1,present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Ciphergen
Biosystems, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index
appearing under a 2 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.
An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
Internal control
over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore,
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
COSO. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of
internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that ipertain to the
maintenance  55 of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Organization
and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company
Ciphergen Biosystems,Inc.
the Company or Ciphergen develops, manufactures and sells ProteinChip
Systems for life science researchers. The core technology, which is patented,
is Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization SELDI. The systems consist
of ProteinChip Readers, ProteinChip Software and related accessories, which are
used in conjunction with consumable ProteinChip Arrays. These products are sold
primarily to biologists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and
academic and government research laboratories. The Company also provides
research services through its Biomarker Discovery Center laboratories.
Basis of
Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain financial statement items have been reclassified to
conform to the current years format. These reclassifications had no impact on
previously reported results of operations.
BioSepra S.A. was a wholly-owned subsidiary and was
consolidated through November 30, 2004, at which time the Company sold BioSepra
S.A., along with other assets related to its process chromotography business. All
comparative periods shown in the statements of operations have been restated to
reflect the BioSepra business as a discontinued operation.
The Company has incurred
significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception.
At December 31, 2004, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $1604 million.
Management believes that currently available resources will provide sufficient
funds to enable the Company to meet its obligations at least through the next
twelve months. If anticipated operating results are not achieved, however,
management believes that planned expenditures may need to be reduced, extending
the time period over which the currently available resources will be adequate to
fund the Companys operations. At such time as the Company requires additional
funding, the Company will seek to raise such additional funding from various
possible sources, including the public equity market, private financings, sales
of assets, collaborative arrangements and debt. If additional capital is raised
through the issuance of equity securities convertible into equity, stockholders
will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or
privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock. There can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such financing, or obtain it
on acceptable terms.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 61 Certain Risks and
Uncertainties
The Companys products and services are currently
concentrated in a single segment of the life science research field, which is
characterized by rapid technological advances and changes in customer
requirements. The success of the Company depends on managements ability to
anticipate and to respond quickly and adequately to technological developments
in its industry, changes in customer requirements and changes in industry
standards. Any significant delays in the development or introduction of new
products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Companys
business and operating results.
The Company licenses
certain technologies that are used in products that represent substantially all
of its revenues. An inability to retain such technology licenses could result
in a material adverse effect to the Company. Additionally, some of the raw
materials and components used in its products are from single-source
suppliers. If the Company is unable to obtain such raw materials and
components, its financial condition and operating results could be
significantly impacted.
Cash and Cash
Equivalents
The Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.
Investments
Management determines the appropriate classification
of the Companys investments in marketable debt securities at the time of
purchase, and re-evaluates this designation at each balance sheet date. At
December31, 2004, the Company classified all marketable securities as available-for-sale
and carries them at fair value with unrealized gains or losses related to these
securities included as a component of other comprehensive income until
realized. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, which is included in interest
income. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific
identification method. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.
The carrying value of the Companys investment in a
fixed rate annuity, which is not within the scope of SFAS 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, approximates fair value due to its
short maturity.
The Companys investment
objectives include the safety and preservation of invested funds and liquidity
of investments that is sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. Cash, cash
equivalents and investments in debt securities are with high credit-quality
financial institutions, commercial companies and government agencies in order
to limit the amount of credit exposure.
Fair Value of
Financial Instruments
The estimated fair value of financial instruments has
been determined using available market information or other appropriate
valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in
interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value; therefore, the
estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized
or would be paid in a current market exchange. The effect of using different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may be material to the
estimated fair value amounts.
The
carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments including
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying
value of the capital leases approximates their fair value based on the
borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar
terms. The fair value of the equipment financing loan was estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using applicable spreads to  62 approximate current interest rates available to the
Company. Convertible senior notes have an estimated fair value based on quoted
market prices. The fair values of the equipment financing loan and the
convertible senior notes as compared to their book values as of December31,
2004 were as follows in thousands

Concentration of
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents
and accounts receivable. Most of the Companys cash and cash equivalents as of December31,
2004 were deposited with financial institutions in the U.S. and exceeded
federally insured amounts. The Company also maintains cash deposits with banks
in Western Europe, Canada, China and Japan. The Company has not experienced any
losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents.
The Companys accounts
receivable are derived from sales made to customers located in North America,
Europe and Asia. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral. The
Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected
collectibility of accounts receivable. No customer accounted for more than 10%
of revenue in 2004 or 2003.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at
the lower of standard cost, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out
basis, or market value. Cost includes direct materials, direct labor,
contracted manufacturing services and manufacturing overhead. Reserves for
potentially excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based on managements analysis
of inventory levels, planned changes in product offerings, sales forecasts and
other factors.
Property, Plant and
Equipment
Property and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and
amortization are computed for financial reporting purposes principally using
the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: machinery
and equipment, 3-5years; computer equipment and software, 3years;
furniture and fixtures, 5years; buildings and leasehold improvements, the
lesser of their economic life or the term of the underlying lease. Assets being
installed or under construction are shown as construction in progress.
Construction in progress is valued based on expenditures incurred up to the balance
sheet date. When the constructed asset is ready for its intended purpose, the
total cost is transferred to the relevant asset class and depreciation
commences. The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to operations as
incurred. Gains and losses resulting from disposals of assets are reflected in
the year of disposition.
Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price
over the estimated fair value of the tangible and intangible net assets
acquired in the Companys acquisitions of IllumeSys Pacific,Inc. in 1997,
Ciphergen Technologies,Inc. in 1998 and Ciphergen Biosystems KK in 2002
and 2004. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and in the
interim whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of goodwill may be impaired. Upon adoption of SFAS142, the Company
performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and noted no such
impairment of goodwill. 63 Other intangible assets
represent a technology license acquired in connection with the settlement of
litigation in 2003 which is stated at cost and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 17years. Other
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be
recoverable.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as
property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets, are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by comparison of
an asset groups carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows the
asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which
the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net
cash flows arising from the assets. Other long-term assets consist
primarily of the offering costs of the convertible senior notes and security
deposits for the Companys leased facilities.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon product
shipment, provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the
receivables is reasonably assured. Revenue from shipping and handling is
generally recognized upon product shipment, based on the amount billed to
customers for shipping and handling. The related cost of shipping and handling
is included in cost of revenue upon product shipment.
Revenue from sales
of separately priced software products is recognized when realized or
realizable and earned, which is when the following criteria are met persuasive
evidence of an agreement exists the
price is fixed or determinable the
product has been delivered no
significant obligations remain, and
collection
of the receivable is deemed probable.
The Company generally includes a standard 12-month warranty
on its instruments and accessories in the form of a maintenance contract upon
initial sale. The Company also sells separately priced maintenance extended
warranty contracts, which are generally for 12 or 24months, upon expiration
of the initial warranty. No distinction is made between a standard warranty and
a maintenance extended warranty contract. Coverage under both the standard
and extended warranty maintenance contracts is identical. Because Ciphergen
does not offer traditional warranties but enhances them such that they are
identical to separately priced maintenance contracts, they are accounted for in
the same way. Revenue for both the standard and extended warranty maintenance
contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance contract term.
Related costs are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect the Companys
warranty costs include the number of installed units, historical and
anticipated rates of warranty claims, and cost per claim. 
For revenue from Biomarker Discovery Center contracts
and other consulting contracts, if elements are specifically tied to a separate
earnings process, then revenue related to an element is recognized when the
specific performance obligation associated with that element is completed. When
revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings
process, they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Revenue
from Biomarker Discovery Center services and other consulting contracts is
recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service as
described in Ciphergens agreement with the customer. Often there is only a
single element, namely delivery of a scientific report  64 upon completion of
Ciphergens analysis of customer samples, in which case the Company recognizes
all the revenue upon the conclusion of the project when all deliverables have
been provided to the customer. Revenue is deferred for fees received before
earned. Ciphergens training is billed based on published course fees and the
Company generally recognizes revenue as the training is provided to the
customer.
For revenue arrangements
with multiple elements that are delivered at different points in time for
example, where Ciphergen has delivered the hardware and software but is also
obligated to provide services, maintenance and/or training, the Company
evaluates whether the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer,
whether the fair value of the undelivered elements is reliably determinable,
and whether the delivery of the remaining elements is probable and within the
Companys control. When all these conditions are met, the Company recognizes revenue
on the delivered elements. If any one of these conditions is not met, the
Company defers the recognition of revenue until all these conditions are met or
all elements have been delivered. Fair values for ongoing maintenance are based
upon separate sales of renewals to other customers. Fair values for services,
such as training or consulting, are based upon separate sales by the Company of
those services to other customers.
Research and
Development Costs
Research and development
expenditures are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development
costs consist primarily of payroll and related costs, materials and supplies
used in the development of new products, and fees paid to consultants and
outside service providers. Software development costs incurred in the research
and development of new products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility is established. To date, products and upgrades have generally
reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially
the same time.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses
advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $665,000 in 2004 279,000 in 2003, and $354,000 in 2002.
Stock-based
Compensation
The Company accounts for its stock-based
employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method of
accounting. Unearned compensation expense is based on the difference, if any,
on the date of the grant between the fair value of the Companys stock and the
exercise price. Unearned compensation is amortized and expensed using an
accelerated method. The Company accounts for stock issued to non-employees
using the fair value method of accounting. 65 Had
compensation expense for options granted to employees, officers and directors
been determined based on fair value at the grant date, the Companys net loss
per share would have increased to the pro forma amounts indicated below in
thousands, except per share data

The expected average life
is based on the assumption that stock options on average are exercised
5years after they are granted. The risk-free interest rate was calculated
in accordance with the grant date and expected average life.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for
income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates
in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred
tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
Foreign Currency
Translation
The functional currency of Ciphergen Biosystems KK is
the Japanese yen. Accordingly, all balance sheet accounts of this operation are
translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of Ciphergen Biosystems KK are
translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period, and
the gains and losses from foreign currency  66 translation are recorded
directly into a separate component of stockholders equity under the caption Accumulated
other comprehensive income.
The functional currency of BioSepra S.A. was the euro.
Upon the completion of the sale of BioSepra on November30, 2004, the
cumulative translation adjustment relating to BioSepra was included in the
determination of the gain on the sale.
The functional currency of all other non-U.S.
operations is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, all monetary assets and liabilities
of these foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current
period-end exchange rates and non-monetary assets and related elements of
expense are translated using historical rates of exchange. Income and expense
elements are translated to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates in effect
during the period. Gains and losses from the foreign currency transactions of
these subsidiaries are recorded as other income or loss in the statement of
operations, and were not material for all years presented.
Recent Accounting
Pronouncements
In October2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004 Jobs Act was signed into law by the President of the United States.
The Jobs Act contains numerous corporate tax changes, including eliminating a
tax benefit relating to U.S. product exports, a lower U.S. tax rate on non-U.S.
dividends and a new deduction relating to U.S. manufacturing. The Company is in
the process of evaluating this legislation. However, the Jobs Act is not
anticipated to materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
In November2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB 43, Chapter4. SFAS No151
requires certain inventory costs to be recognized as current period expenses. This
standard also provides guidance for the allocation of fixed production overhead
costs. This standard is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal
years beginning after June15, 2005. The Company will adopt this standard
in fiscal 2006. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, this standard
will have on the financial statements of the Company.
In December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123
Revised, Share-Based Payment. This standard revises SFAS No123, APB
25 and related accounting interpretations, and eliminates the use of the intrinsic
value method. As noted previously, the Company currently uses the intrinsic
value method of APB 25 to value stock options, and accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recognized for stock options. This standard requires the
expensing of all stock-based compensation, including stock options, using the
fair value method. For the Company, the effective date of this standard will be
July1, 2005. The Company has not yet determined the impact this standard
will have on its financial statements.
In December2004, the
FASB issued SFAS No153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary AssetsAn Amendment of
APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS 153
eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
of similar productive assets in paragraph 21bof APB Opinion No29,
Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception
for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a
nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the
entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS
153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning after June15, 2005 and is
required to be adopted by Ciphergen in the third quarter of 2005. The Company
is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have on
its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, but
does not expect it to have a material impact. 67 2. Marketable Securities and Other

to their maturity date to meet operating needs. The total amortized cost of the
securities sold prior to maturity during the year was not material. The loss on
these sales was also not material. During 2003, no marketable securities were
sold prior to maturity.
At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the Company had an investment in a fixed rate annuity with a fair value
of approximately $22 million and $21 million, respectively. On February 28,
2005, the Company exercised its option to renew the annuity for one year at an
estimated interest rate of 30% per annum.

was $4,741 in 2004, $4,112 in 2003 and $3,076 in 2002.
Approximately $6,081 of
net property, plant and equipment was included in the sale of the BioSepra
business on November30, 2004.
5. Purchase
of Additional Ownership Interest in Ciphergen Biosystems KK
In January1999, the Company formed Ciphergen
Biosystems KK and took a 30% equity interest in this joint venture with
Sumitomo Corporation to distribute the Companys products in Japan. On August31,
2002, the Company acquired an additional 40% ownership in Ciphergen Biosystems
KK, bringing its total ownership to 70%. On March23, 2004, the Company
acquired the remaining 30% equity stake in Ciphergen Biosystems KK, bringing
its total ownership to 100%, in order to facilitate further expansion of the
Companys activities in Japan. The Company paid $10 million in cash to SC
BioSciences a unit of Sumitomo Corporation for the final 30% of the shares of
Ciphergen Biosystems KK common stock. Acquisition costs were immaterial. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The
total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed as follows in thousands

On November30,
2004, Ciphergen completed the sale to Pall Corporation of its wholly-owned
French subsidiary, BioSepra S.A., along with selected other assets together the
BioSepra business. The sale of the BioSepra business generated net proceeds
of approximately $270 million. An additional $10 million is being held in an
interest-bearing escrow account for one year, upon which claims for selling
price adjustments may be made by the buyer. The Company recognized an $185

7. Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets
The
Company adopted SFAS142 on January1, 2002 for all goodwill and
other intangible assets. As a result, goodwill is no longer amortized but
rather tested for impairment at least annually and in the interim whenever circumstances
indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Upon adoption, the Company performed  70 a transitional goodwill impairment assessment and
noted no such impairment of goodwill. The Company also performed annual
impairment tests in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and determined that no impairment had
occurred. Goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following in

Annual amortization expense for these intangible
assets is expected to be approximately $1,209,000 in 2005; $1,209,000 in 2006 622,000 in 2007; and zero in subsequent years. Amortization expense for the
acquired license related to the litigation settlement is charged to cost of
revenue.
The acquired license is amortized to cost of revenue.
It is related to the May28, 2003 litigation settlement between Ciphergen
and Molecular Analytical Systems,Inc. MAS, LumiCyte,Inc. LumiCyte,
and T.William Hutchens whereby the Company acquired the undisputed
exclusive rights granted to MAS under patents licensed from Baylor College of
Medicine and the parties released all claims against each other. These patent
rights refer to technology known as SELDI-TOF-MS, and provide the Company with
an exclusive worldwide license and right to sublicense the technology and to
commercialize any and all products, information and services derived from the
technology without limitation.
Furthermore,
LumiCyte assigned all rights granted to it from MAS and related to the Baylor
College of Medicine patents to the Company without restriction. As part of the
settlement a Ciphergen paid LumiCyte
$30million in cash b Ciphergen issued to
LumiCyte 1,250,000 shares of Ciphergen common stock which were valued at
$78million; and
c Ciphergen agreed to pay
license fees to MAS based on the revenues Ciphergen and its affiliates derive
from the SELDI technology and recognize between February21, 2003 and May28,
2014,  71 provided that such license
fees will not exceed $10million during calendar year 2003 or
$100million in the aggregate. Although $100 million is the maximum
amount that could be payable, management believes it is likely that in the
remaining approximately nine years until May2014, the Company will
achieve cumulative sales sufficient to reach this upper limit. Through December31,
2004, the Company had paid or accrued a total of $17million in such
license fees.
The total cost of the
litigation settlement, including future license fees, is expected to be
$208million. Management cannot predict the amount of future revenue that
will be earned over the remaining life of the technology. Therefore, the
license fees are not recognized based on revenue. Rather, the license rights
are treated as an intangible asset that the Company purchased, and are
amortized over its 17-year useful life, from April1997 to May2014,
using the straight line method. Of the total anticipated settlement costs of
$208 million, $73million was attributed to periods prior to April1,
2003 and expensed in the second quarter of 2003. $906,000 was amortized to cost
of revenue in the remainder of 2003, $12 million was amortized to cost of
revenue in 2004, and the remaining $114million will be amortized to cost
of revenue in future periods through the second quarter of 2014. The cost is
being prorated between cost of products revenue and cost of services revenue
based on the ratio of SELDI-based products revenue to SELDI-based services
revenue.

9. Warranties
and Maintenance Contracts
Ciphergen has a direct field service organization that
provides service for its products. The Company generally includes a standard
12month warranty on its ProteinChip Systems, ProteinChip Tandem MS
Interfaces and accessories in the form of a maintenance contract upon initial
sale, after which maintenance and support may be provided under a separately
priced contract or on an individual call basis. Ciphergen makes no distinction
between a standard warranty and a maintenance extended warranty contract. The
Company substitutes a maintenance contract in place of a standard 12-month
warranty on its instruments and accessories upon initial sale. Ciphergen also
sells separately priced maintenance extended warranty contracts, which are
generally for 12 or 24 months, upon expiration of the initial warranty. Coverage
under both the standard and extended warranty maintenance contracts is
identical. Because the Company does not offer traditional warranties but
enhances them such that they are identical to our separately priced maintenance
contracts, management believes it is appropriate to account for them in the
same way. Revenue for both the standard and extended warranty maintenance
contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period
of the applicable maintenance contract. Related costs are recognized as
incurred. 72 Changes

obligations, during the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003 were as

10. Long-term
Debt and Capital Leases
45% Convertible
Senior Notes Due 2008
On August22, 2003, the Company closed the sale
of $300million of convertible senior notes due September1, 2008.
Offering costs were approximately $19million. Interest on the notes is
45% per annum on the principal amount, payable semiannually on March1
and September1, beginning March1, 2004. The effective interest rate
is 585% per annum. The notes are convertible, at the option of the holder, at
any time on or prior to maturity of the notes into shares of the Companys
common stock initially at a conversion rate of 1088329 shares per $1,000
principal amount of the notes, which is equal to a conversion price of
approximately $919 per share. The conversion price, and hence the conversion
rate, is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, such as
stock splits, stock dividends and other distributions or recapitalizations.
Because the market value of the stock rose above the conversion price between
the day the notes were priced and the closing date, the Company recorded a
discount of $2,677,000 related to the intrinsic value of the beneficial
conversion feature resulting from this price change and the fact that the
initial purchaser of the notes was not required to purchase the notes until the
closing date. Immediately after the closing, Ciphergen common stock had a
market price of $1001 per share, or $082 per share higher than the conversion
price. The value of the beneficial conversion feature was determined by
multiplying this difference in the per share price of Ciphergens common stock
by the 3,264,987 underlying shares. This amount will be amortized to interest
expense using the effective interest method over the five-year term of the
notes, or shorter period in the event of conversion of the notes. Amortization
in 2004 and 2003 amounted to $536,000 and $192,000, respectively.
The notes are the Companys senior unsecured
obligations and rank on parity in right of payment with all of the Companys
existing and future senior unsecured debt and rank senior to the Companys
existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the
notes. The notes are also effectively subordinated in right of payment to the
Companys existing and future secured debt, to the extent of such security, and
to its subsidiaries liabilities. The indenture does not limit the incurrence
by the Company or its subsidiaries of other indebtedness.
The Company may redeem the notes at its option, in
whole or in part, at any time on or after September1, 2006 at specified redemption
prices plus accrued and unpaid interest, provided that the notes will be
redeemable only if the closing price of the stock equals or exceeds 150% of the
conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days within a period of
30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before the date of the
notice of the redemption. The 3,264,987 shares that could be issued if all
convertible senior notes were converted into common stock have not been
included in the calculation of loss per share, as these potential common shares
are antidilutive. Upon a change of control, each holder of the notes may
require the Company to repurchase some or all of the notes at specified
redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The debenture contains a
put option that entitles the holder to require the Company to redeem the
debenture at a price equal to 1075% of the principal balance upon a change in
control of the Company prior to August31, 2005 and 1050% thereafter. The
Company does not  73 anticipate that the put
option will have significant value because no change of control is currently
contemplated.
The notes and common stock
issuable upon conversion of the notes were registered with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission on FormS-3 on October8, 2003, and at December31,
2004 all notes remained issued and outstanding.
Equipment Financing
Loan
In June2003, the Company entered into a loan and
security agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation to obtain
financing for up to $50million of capital equipment purchases. The loan
is collateralized by the equipment being financed as well as certain other
assets of the Company. As of June30, 2004, the last day on which the
Company could draw against this facility, the Company had financed
$21million of capital equipment purchases through this facility at an
annual interest rate of 748%, repayable in monthly installments over
36months from the date of each drawdown under the agreement. As of December31,
2004, the balance outstanding on the loan, including interest charges, was
approximately $13million, with the final payment scheduled for July1,
2006.
Capital Leases
The Company leases certain machinery and equipment in
Japan under capital lease agreements with Sumitomo Corporation and other
independent finance companies; these leases expire at various times through July31,
2009. The interest rates are fixed rates. The weighted average interest rate
was 50% at December31, 2004.

11. Foreign
Currency Contracts
During the year ended December31,
2004, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the
volatility of currency fluctuations as a result of an intercompany loan of
approximately $10million, denominated in yen, to the Companys
subsidiary in Japan. The effect of exchange rate changes on the forward
exchange contracts largely offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the
intercompany loan. As of December31, 2004, there were no forward
contracts outstanding. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses related
to foreign currency forward contracts were recorded in other income expense
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and were not material for the year
ended December31, 2004. 74 12. Commitments
and Contingencies
Operating Leases
The Company leases various equipment and facilities to
support its worldwide manufacturing, research and development, Biomarker
Discovery Center, and sales and marketing activities. Total rent expense under
all leases, net of sublease income, was $3,685,000, $3,514,000, and $2,828,000
in the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
Company leases its Fremont facility under a non-cancelable operating
lease that expires on July31, 2008. The lease provides for escalations of
lease payments of approximately 4% per year. Sublease income paid by a tenant
at the Companys Fremont facility was $0 in 2004 and 2003, and $475,000 in
2002.

into an agreement to fund a Biomarker Discovery Center collaboration with The
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Under this agreement, Ciphergen
has an obligation to fund a total of $914,000 for the period from December 2004

Plan 
The Company has no shares
of common stock reserved for sale to employees, directors or consultants under
its 1993 Stock Option Plan the 1993 Plan. Under the 1993 Plan, options were

over a period of five years and unexercised options generally expire ten years
from the date of grant. At December31, 2004, a total of 4,637 shares of
common stock were subject to repurchase by the Company at a weighted average
repurchase price of $349 per share. Since the Companys initial public
offering, no options have been granted under the 1993 Plan. During 2002, 2003

Stock-Based Compensation
During the years ended December31,
2002, 2003 and 2004, the exercise prices of all options granted were equal to
fair market value on the dates of grant. During the period from April1997
through December31, 2004, the Company recorded $209 million of stock-based
compensation related to stock options granted to consultants and employees. For
options granted to consultants, the Company determined the fair value of the
options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following  77 assumptions:
expected lives of five years; weighted average risk-free rate calculated using
rates between 45% and 62%; expected dividend yield of zero percent;
volatility of 75% and deemed values of common stock between $035 and $1467
per share. Stock compensation expense was recognized in accordance with an
accelerated amortization method, over the vesting periods of the related
options, which are generally five years.
The
allocation of stock-based compensation expense by functional area was as

Warrants
At December31, 2002,
warrants to purchase 9,010 shares of common stock were outstanding, at a
weighted average exercise price of $354 per share. These warrants were
exercised or canceled during 2003, and at December31, 2003 and 2004, no
warrants remained outstanding.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In April2000, the
stockholders approved the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which
eligible employees may purchase common stock of the Company through payroll
deductions. Purchases are made semi-annually at a price equal to the lower of
85% of the closing price on the applicable offering commencement date or 85% of
the closing price at the end of the purchase period. At December31, 2004,
the Company had 250,040 shares of common stock reserved for purchase by
employees under this Plan. During 2002, 2003 and 2004, purchases of 175,519,
310,026 and 306,209 shares, respectively, were made under this Plan. There was
no activity under this plan in 2000.
On January1, 2003,
2004 and 2005 an additional 250,000, 290,795 and 180,000 shares, respectively,
were reserved for purchase under the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. On June3,
2004, the stockholders approved an additional 250,000 shares to be reserved for
this Plan.
15. Income Taxes
The Company accounts for
income taxes using the liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets
and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the current tax laws
and rates. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized.
The Company has incurred
income tax liabilities primarily in France and Japan, as well as in most of the
other countries outside the U.S. in which it operates.The Companys provision
for income taxes was due to current foreign income taxes, which were $172,000 14million and $61,000 for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively, including discontinued operations. Excluding
discontinued operations, current foreign income taxes were an expense of $109,000,
a benefit of $47,000 and a benefit of $44,000 for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Based on the available objective evidence, management
believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not
be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company has provided a full valuation
allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2004. 78 Net
deferred tax assets liabilities consisted of the following in thousands

Pre-tax U.S. losses were $214 million, $398 million
and $313 million and pre-tax foreign income was $18 million, 46 million and
$23 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including discontinued
operations. Excluding discontinued operations, pre-tax U.S. losses were $384
million, $395 million and $300 million and pre-tax foreign income or losses
were income of $18 million, income of $641,000 and a loss of $629,000 in 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.
As of December31, 2004, the Company had net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1222million for federal
and $157million for state tax purposes. If not utilized, these carryforwards
will expire beginning in 2009 for federal purposes and 2005 for state purposes.
The Company had research credit carryforwards of
approximately $40million and $37million for federal and state
income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research credit
carryforward will expire in various amounts beginning in 2011. The California
research credit can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Internal Revenue Code limits the use of net
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes
occur in the stock ownership of a company. In the event the Company has a
change in ownership, utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted.
The Company has used net operating loss carryforwards
to reduce its income tax liabilities in France and Japan. It fully utilized its
French net operating loss carryforwards in 2003, resulting in higher French
income tax liability in 2003 when BioSepra generated net income, although this
was followed in 2004 by a net loss. The Company fully utilized its Japanese net
operating loss carryforwards in 2004, resulting in higher 2004 Japanese income
tax liability.
Deferred taxes are not provided for the earnings of
the Companys foreign subsidiaries, as those earnings are considered permanently
reinvested in the operations of the foreign subsidiaries and the Company
intends to continue to reinvest its undistributed international earnings to
expand its international  79 operations. It is not
practical to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on the
foreign earnings should they become subject to U.S. tax.
16. Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income loss generally represents all
changes in stockholders equity except those resulting from investments or contributions
by stockholders. The Companys unrealized gains losses on available-for-sale
investments and cumulative translation adjustments represent the components of
comprehensive income loss that are excluded from the net income loss.

per Share
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net
loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net
loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and potential
common shares outstanding during the period, if their effect is dilutive.
Potential common shares include shares that could be issued if all convertible
senior notes were converted into common stock, common stock subject to
repurchase, common stock issuable under the Companys 2000 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants.

compensation at the discretion of the employee. Under the Plan, the Company is
not required to make Plan contributions. The Company had not made any
contributions to the Plan as of December31, 2004.

The Company also purchased
from Stanford Research Systems $894,000 and $548,000 of inventory in 2002 and
2003, respectively, during which time the supplier was deemed to be a related
party by virtue of the fact that its President was a member of Ciphergens
Board of Directors. The Company also made non-cash payments in the form of 49,450
shares of Ciphergen common stock to this related party in 2002 under the terms
of a joint development agreement. See Note12. This director resigned
from the Board on April7, 2003, and in 2004 the vendor was no longer
considered a related party. 81 20. Segment
Information and Geographic Data
Ciphergens revenue is derived from the sales of
related products and services on a worldwide basis. Although discrete
components that earn revenues and incur expenses exist, significant expenses
such as sales and marketing and corporate administration are not incurred by
nor allocated to these operating units but rather are employed by the entire
enterprise. Additionally, the chief operating decision maker evaluates resource
allocation not on a product or geographic basis, but rather on an
enterprise-wide basis. Therefore, management has determined that Ciphergen
operates in only one reportable segment, which is the protein research tools
and collaborative services business.
The
following table reflects the results of the Companys sales to external
customers by similar products and services for the years ended December31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 in thousands. Revenue from discontinued operations has
been excluded.

21. Quarterly
Consolidated Financial Data Unaudited
The
following table presents certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial
information for the eight quarters ended December31, 2004. Revenue and
gross profit for discontinued operations have been excluded in all periods
shown as a result of the sale of our BioSepra business. In the second quarter
of 2003, gross profit was reduced and net loss was increased by the inclusion
of a non-recurring $73million  82 expense related to the settlement of litigation. See
Note7. In managements opinion, this information has been prepared on the
same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and includes all
adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, except for the
non-recurring expense resulting from the litigation settlement necessary to
present fairly the unaudited quarterly results of operations set forth herein.
