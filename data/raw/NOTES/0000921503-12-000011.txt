No single customer accounts for 10% or more of Net Sales. Foreign Currency Translation The Companys international subsidiaries generally use their local currency as their functional currency.Therefore, all Balance Sheet accounts of international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the year-end rates of exchange and Statement of Earnings items are translated using the weighted average exchange rates for the period.Resulting translation adjustments are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income loss AOCI within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Transactional gains and losses arising from the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions in a currency other than the local functional currency are included in Foreign
exchange and other, net within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Investments The Company makes investments from time to time in the ordinary course of its business that may include common and preferred equity securities, debt instruments all maturing within one year, mutual funds, cost investments and long-term investments and/or joint ventures. The Companys investments are accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topics 320 Investments debt and equity securities and 325, Investments - other. The Company reviews investments for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative factors.
Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities that are considered temporary and are not the result of a credit loss are included in AOCI, net of applicable taxes, while realized gains and losses are reported in earnings. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases, intercompany payables and certain loans. It does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.The Company has also hedged the net assets of certain of its foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts. The Company has designated forward exchange contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in AOCI until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged.With regard to commitments for inventory purchases, upon payment of each commitment, the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from AOCI upon sale of the asset assigned and is realized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.If a hedging instrument
is sold or terminated prior to maturity, gains and losses are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is settled.However, if the hedged item is probable of no longer occurring, the resultant gain or loss on thehedge is recognized into earnings immediately. The Company has designated its foreign currency forward contracts related to certain foreign denominated loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges.The gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge. For consolidated financial statement presentation, net cash flows from such hedges are classified in the categories of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows with the items being hedged. Forward contracts held with each bank are presented within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a net asset or liability, based on netting agreements with each bank and whether the forward contracts are in a net gain or loss position. Refer to Note 8 for further details on our accounting for derivative instruments.  48 Return to Top Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly-liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.Insignificant amounts due from credit card companies for the settlement of credit card transactions are included in cash equivalents because they are both short-term and highly-liquid instruments and typically take one to three business days to be received by the Company. The major credit card companies making these payments are highly accredited businesses and the Company does not deem them as having material counterparty credit risk. The Company holds its cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions. Cash balances in the Companys U.S. concentration accounts are fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation with no limit per bank. The Company has $21 million of restricted cash, reported in Investments, in certificates of deposits, of which $18 million is used as collateral to standby letters of credit. This cash will be restricted until the standby letters of credit are relieved by the beneficiaries. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method.The Company records provisions for obsolete, excess and unmarketable inventory in Cost of goods sold. Shipping and Handling The Company classifies shipping and handling fees billed to customers as Revenue, and shipping and handling costs as Cost of goods sold. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.Depreciation expense for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was $100 million, $108 million and $128 million, respectively.The amortization of assets obtained through capital leases is also recorded as a component of depreciation expense. Depreciation is provided for principally by use of the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes.Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the respective leases or the service lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.The Company records gains and losses from the sale of
property, plant and equipment in operating profit. The principal estimated lives used in determining depreciation are as follows Buildings 27 to 40 years Leasehold improvements 5 to 10 years Machinery and equipment 5 to 12 years Office furniture, data processing equipment and software 3 to7 years Goodwill and Other Indefinite Lived Intangibles Goodwill and Other indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired. The Company performs its annual assessment of impairment as of January 31. For goodwill, the first step is to identify whether a potential impairment exists. This is done by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill.Fair value for each of the Companys reporting units is estimated utilizing a combination of valuation techniques, namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple analysis. The discounted cash flow analysis assumes the fair value of an asset can be estimated by the economic benefit or net cash flows the asset will generate over the life of the asset, discounted to its present value. The discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and the investment
risk factors. The market multiple analysis estimates fair value based on what other participants in the market have recently paid for reasonably similar assets. Adjustments are made to compensate for differences between the reasonably similar assets and the assets being valued. The fair value of the reporting units is derived by using a combination of the two valuation techniques described above. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, no further analysis is necessary. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the estimated fair value of the goodwill. If fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the goodwill and a charge to operating expense.  49 Return to Top For indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value for indefinite-lived intangible assets and compares this value to book value. The underlying concept of the relief from royalty method is that the inherent economic value of intangibles is directly related to the timing of future cash flows associated with the intangible asset. Similar to the income approach or discounted cash flow methodology used to determine the fair value of goodwill, the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is equal to the present value of after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset based on an applicable royalty rate. The royalty rate is determined by
using existing market comparables for royalty agreements. The arms-length agreements generally support a rate that is a percentage of direct sales. This approach is based on the premise that the free cash flow is a more valid criterion for measuring value than book or accounting profits. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company reviews long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable. When indicators are present, management determines whether there has been an impairment on long-lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset.The amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value.Long-lived assets that meet the definition
of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value. Assets or asset groups are determined at the lowest level possible for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For assets whose aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, the assets are considered potentially impaired and actual impairments, if any, would be determined to the extent the assets carrying value exceeds its aggregate fair value. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Loss AOCI is comprised of foreign currency cumulative translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in debt and equity securities, the net gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments and net investment hedges and a realized gain on a Pension Plan termination.The Company reports, by major components and as a single total, the change in comprehensive income loss during the period as part of the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The following table presents the components of the Companys cumulative AOCI, net of deferred tax liabilities of $123 million and $61 million as ofDecember and January 31, 2011, respectively. In thousands Foreign currency 
translation adjustments Unrealized gain on certain investments Net gain loss on cash flow hedges Net gain on net investment hedges Accumulated other comprehensive income Balance at January 31, 2011 13,102 534 130 5,596 19,102 Balance at December 31, 2011 5,234 658 374 5,596 11,862  50 Return to Top Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on taxable income, statutory tax rates and the impact of non-deductible items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.The Company periodically estimates whether its tax benefits are more likely than not sustainable on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.There are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company transacts business.The judgments and
estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations.If such changes take place, there is a risk that the Companys tax expense may increase or decrease in any period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the Companys best estimate of the tax benefits and costs expected to realize in the future. The Company establishes valuation allowances to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes ASC 740, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position for which we have established a tax reserve is audited and finally resolved, and the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction a current summary is provided in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. When facts and circumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and
record any necessary adjustments to the provision. The Company has determined that a portion of its undistributed foreign earnings are not reinvested indefinitely by its non-U.S. subsidiaries, and accordingly, recorded a deferred income tax expense related to these undistributed earnings. The Company periodically reassesses whether the non-U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely. Revenue Recognition Revenues consist of sales to customers, net of returns and allowances.The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery, when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer.The Company presents revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs, which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers, volume incentives and other promotions.The Company also records reductions to revenue, based primarily on historical experience, for estimated customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors, product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue.In some instances, the Company receives payment in advance of product delivery.Such advance payments occur primarily in the direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred
revenue.Upon delivery of product for which advance payment has been made, the related deferred revenue is reversed and recorded to revenue. Gift card sales are also included in deferred revenue. Upon redemption or when redemption is remote, the related deferred revenue is recorded to revenue. The Company considers applicable escheat laws and historical redemption data when realizing gift card revenue. The Company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts for its trade and note receivables.The allowance is determined based on the Companys evaluation of specific customers ability to pay, aging of receivables, historical experience and the current economic environment. The sales price for the Companys products sold is fixed prior to the time of shipment to the customer.Customers do not have the right to return product, except for rights to return that the Company believes are typical of the industry for such reasons as damaged goods, shipping errors or similar occurrences. The Company is not required to repurchase products from its customers and does not have
regular practice of doing so. The Company does not make any sales under consignment or similar arrangements. Earnings per Common and Common Equivalent Share Basic earnings per common share and common share equivalents are computed based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. These outstanding shares include both outstanding common shares and vested restricted stock units RSUs as common stock equivalents. Diluted earnings per common share and common share 
equivalents reflect the potential dilution that could occur if options and fixed awards to be issued under stock-based compensation arrangements were converted into common stock.  51 Return to Top Employee Stock Compensation The Company has share-based compensation plans as described in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP the Company measures and records compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expenses Cost of goods sold includes the cost of raw materials and their procurement costs, inbound and outbound freight, and the direct and indirect costs associated with the personnel, resources and property plant and equipment related to the manufacturing, warehousing, inventory management and order fulfillment functions. Selling expenses include commissions paid to consultants and promoters, customer service costs, the costs associated with trade shows and showrooms, catalog costs including printing and shipping, the salaries and benefits related to personnel within the marketing and selling functions, costs associated with promotional offers to independent consultants and promoters, and other selling and marketing
expenses. Administrative and other expenses includes salaries and related benefits associated with various administrative departments, including human resources, legal, information technology, finance and executive, as well as professional fees and administrative facility costs associated with leased buildings, office equipment and supplies. Promotional Offers to Independent Consultants and Promoters The Companys Direct Selling sales are generated by its independent consultants and promoters, who strive to maximize the interrelated objectives of selling product, scheduling or booking parties or events and recruiting new consultants and promoters.In order to encourage its consultants and promoters to accomplish these goals, the Company makes monthly promotional offers including free or discounted products to consultants, promoters and customers, as well as annual incentive trips and the payment of bonuses to consultants and promoters. Promotions, including free or discounted products, are designed to increase revenues by providing incentives for customers and guests attending shows whose purchases exceed a certain level. Promotional offers for free products are recorded as a charge to Cost of goods sold when incurred, and promotional offers for discounted products are recorded as a reduction of revenue when incurred with the full cost of the product being charged to Cost of goods sold.Sales bonuses are awarded based on achieving certain ranks within the compensation plan. These bonuses are paid monthly and are charged to selling expenses when earned. Annual incentive trips and bonuses are awarded to consultants and promoters who recruit new consultants or promoters or achieve certain sales levels. Estimated costs related to these promotional offers are recorded as compensation within Selling expense as they are earned. For the eleven month period ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010, related promotional expenses were recorded of $235 million, $103 million and $86 million, respectively. Advertising and Catalog Costs The Company expenses the costs of advertising as incurred, except the costs for direct-response advertising, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of future benefit. For the eleven month period ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010, advertising expenses were recorded of $646 million, $673 million and $682 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2011 and January 31, 2011, prepaid advertising expenses totaled $90 million and $69 million, respectively.  52 Return to Top Direct-response advertising relates to the Miles Kimball business and consists primarily of the costs to produce direct-mail order catalogs.The capitalized production costs are amortized for each specific catalog mailing over the period following catalog distribution in proportion to revenues orders received, compared to total estimated revenues for that particular catalog mailing.The amortization period is generally from three to six months and does not exceed twelve months. In certain of the Companys Wholesale and Direct Selling businesses, catalog production costs are capitalized and expensed as the catalogs are distributed, generally over less than a twelve month period. Note 2. Change in Accounting Principle Historically, the Company consolidated the financial statements of the PartyLite European, Mexican and Australian operations and the ViSalus Sciences operating resultsusing a calendar year-end basis, thereby reporting the results of these entities on a one month lag. Effective November 1, 2011, the Company has eliminated this one month lag to conform to the Companys fiscal year-end. This change is preferable as it 1 aligns the fiscal year-ends of the Companys PartyLites international operations and the ViSalus Sciences business with the parent and other subsidiaries, except for certain subsidiaries that operate on a 52 or 53 week fiscal year end and 2 results in contemporaneous
reporting of these entities operating results. Section 810-10-45-13 of the Accounting Standards Codification codification requires the elimination of a reporting lag between a parent and subsidiary to be reported as a change in accounting principle. Topic 250 of the codification requires this change to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented and as such the Companys reported results for the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 have been adjusted for this retrospective application.The following tables present the effect of this change in accounting principle on the statement of financial position as of January 31, 2011 and on the operating results and statements of cash flow as of and for the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010.  53 Return to Top BLYTH, INC.

ASU No2011-04 does not extend the use of fair value accounting, but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within U.S. GAAP. The amendments in ASU No2011-04 change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. Amendments in ASU No2011-04 include those that: 1clarify the FASBs
intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, and 2change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the FASB does not intend for the amendments in ASU No2011-04 to result in a change in the application of the requirements in Topic 820. ASU No2011-04 is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December15, 2011. Accordingly, the Company will adopt ASU No2011-04 commencing in 2012. The adoption of ASU No2011-04 is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income ASU 2011-05. Under ASU 2011-05, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. Under both options, an entity will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date
for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05 ASU 2011-12, which deferred the requirement to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income while the FASB further deliberates this aspect of the proposal. These amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income and also do not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented. ASU 2011-05, as amended by ASU 2011-12, is effective for us on January 1, 2012. The adoption of this guidance will not impact our accounting for comprehensive income, but will affect our presentation of components of
comprehensive income and is not expected to have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment ASU 2011-08.This update amended the procedures surrounding goodwill impairment testing to permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. On December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ASU 2011-11. The new disclosure requirements mandate that entities disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of collateral received and posted in connection with master netting agreements or similar arrangements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. This ASU will not have
a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, but will change the Companys disclosure policies for financial derivative instruments.  59 Return to Top Note 4. Business Acquisitions In August 2008, the Company signed a definitive agreement to purchase ViSalus, a direct seller of weight management products, nutritional supplements and energy drinks, through a series of investments. In October 2008, the Company completed its initial investment and acquired a 436% equity interest in ViSalus for $130 million in cash and incurred acquisition costs of $10 million for a total cash acquisition cost of $140 million. In April 2011, the Company completed the second phase of its acquisition of ViSalus for approximately $25 million increasing its ownership to 575%. Subsequent to December 31, 2011, the Company completed the third phase of its acquisition of ViSalus and increased its ownership to 735% for approximately $225 million in cash and the issuance of 340,662 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock valued at $146 million that may not be sold or transferred prior to January 12, 2014.Due to the restrictions on transfer, the common stock was issued at a discount to its trading price. The payments in the third closing were based upon an estimate of the 2011 EBITDA pursuant to the formula in the original purchase agreement, and will be adjusted in April 2012for thedifference between the actual 2011 EBITDA and the estimate used in the
third closing. The Company expects to pay approximately $56 million in April 2012 after finaldetermination of the actual 2011 EBITDA, which would bring the total third phase acquisition cost to approximately $427 million. The Company intends to and may be required to purchase the remaining interest in ViSalus to increase ownership to 100%. The fourth phase and final purchase of ViSalus is conditioned upon ViSalus meeting its original purchase agreements 2012 operating target.The Company has the option, but is not required, to acquire the remaining interest in ViSalus if it does not meet this operating target.However, as of December 31, 2011, the operating target for 2012 requiring the additional purchase is anticipated to be met.If ViSalus meets its current projected 2012 EBITDA forecast, the total expected redemption cost of the fourth and final phase will be approximately $214 million to be paid in
2013. The purchase price of the additional investment is equal to a multiple of ViSaluss EBITDA, exclusive of certain unusual items. The payment, if any, may be funded in part using existing cash balances from both domestic and international sources, expected future cash flows from operations and the issuance of common stock and may require the Company to obtain additional sources of external financing. The Company accounted for the acquisition of ViSalus as a business combination under SFAS No. 141 Business Combinations, since the Company obtained control of ViSalus prior to the effective date of ASC 805. The Company analyzed the criteria for consolidation in accordance with ASC 810, and determined it had control since ViSalus was majority owned collectively by Blyth and Ropart Asset Management Fund, LLC and Ropart Asset Management Fund II, LLC collectively, RAM, a related party see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Moreover, the Company took into account the then composition of ViSaluss three-member Board of Managers, one
of whom was an executive officer of the Company, one of whom was a principal of RAM and one of whom was a founder and executive officer of ViSalus.Additionally, the Company and RAM together control ViSaluss compensation committee and control the compensation of the ViSalus executive officer who serves on ViSaluss Board of Managers.Consequently, all of the members of ViSaluss Board of Managers may be deemed to operate under the Companys influence. The Company has also taken into account ViSaluss governing documents, which afford the Company significant rights with respect to major corporate actions and the right to force the other owners of ViSaluss equity to sell in certain circumstances.Finally, the Company considered the mechanisms that are in place to permit it to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interest in ViSalus.  60 Return to Top As discussed above, the Company may be required to purchase the remaining noncontrolling interests in ViSalus if ViSalus meets its 2012 calendar year operating targets. As a result, these noncontrolling interests were determined to be redeemable and are accounted for in accordance with the guidance of ASC 480-10-S99-3A, and the non-codified portions of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-98, Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities. Accordingly, the Company has begun recognizing these noncontrolling interest obligations outside of permanent equity and has accreted changes in their redemption value through the date of redemption during the time at which it was probable that the
noncontrolling interests would be redeemed.The accretion of the redemption value has been recognized as a charge to retained earnings and to the extent that the resulting redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interests, the differential could result in future adjustments in the Companys earnings per share EPS should the redemption value exceed fair value. The carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was $874 million as of December 31, 2011 and has been reflected as Redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of December 31, 2011, the estimated redemption value did not exceed fair value and no adjustment was recorded. The acquisition of ViSalus by Blyth involves related parties, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to Blyth, the other owners of ViSalus, include its three founders each of whom currently own approximately 64% of ViSalus for a total of 192% the founders, RAM which currently owns 41%, and a small group of employees and others who collectively own approximately 32% of ViSalus.Blyths initial investment in ViSalus of $130 million was paid to ViSalus $25 million, RAM $30 million and each of the three founders $25 million each. Blyths second investment of $25 million was paid to RAM $10 million, each of the three founders $03
million each and others $06 million in the aggregate.Blyths third investment in ViSalus, made subsequent to year-end, of $225 million in cash and the issuance of 340,662 unregistered shares of common stock was paid to RAM $99 million in cash, the three founders a total of $76 million in cash and the issuance of a total of 340,662 unregistered shares and others $50 million in cash, in the aggregate. Mr. Goergen, Blyths chairman and chief executive officer, beneficially owns approximately 352% of Blyths outstanding common stock, and together with members of his family, owns substantially all of RAM. ViSalus has recorded equity incentive compensation expense related to certain equity rights and unit holders that allow the settlement of these awards through a future cash payment. As a result, these awards are classified as a liability and are subject to fair value measurement in accordance with ASC section 718 on Stock Compensation. The Company has recorded an expense of $271 million and $19 million in Administrative and Other expense for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the year ended January 31, 2011, respectively.Additional expense or expense reduction may be recorded in future periods for increases or decreases in the fair value of these awards. The fair value of
these awards is based on ViSaluss future operating performance and may change significantly if ViSaluss sales forecasts and operating profits exceed or fallshort of projections. Note 5.Discontinued Operations On May 27, 2011, the Company sold substantially all of the net assets of its seasonal, home dcor and home fragrance business Midwest-CBK within the Wholesale segment for approximately $369 million and incurred a loss of approximately $25 million, net of tax benefits. The agreement provided for a net working capital adjustment of $14 million, which was received subsequent to the sale in July 2011. The Company received cash proceeds of $236 million and a one year promissory note of $119 million included within Other current assets secured by fixed assets sold at the time of the transaction. The Company also received an advance payment of interest on the promissory note of $05 million at the
time of closing. For the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010, revenues for Midwest-CBK were $173 million, $1046 million and $978 million, respectively and loss before income taxes were $51 million, income of $08 million and loss of $93 million, respectively. On February 11, 2011, the Company assigned all the assets and liabilities of the Boca Java business through a court approved assignment for the benefit of its creditors. The proceeds from the sale of the assets were used to discharge the claims of the creditors. In the fourth quarter of the year ended January 31, 2011, the Company assessed the recoverability of these assets and recorded a $11 million impairment charge. This charge was primarily to write down its fixed assets, inventories on hand and other assets, net of any expected recoveries and was recorded to Cost of goods sold and Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings Loss within the Catalog and Internet Segment. Revenue and losses
before income taxes for Boca Java are not significant.  61 Return to Top These transactions are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements and results of operations for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010.

The basis for the preferred stock is their fair value as of February 1, 2009, the date that they were reclassified from trading to available for sale. As of December 31, 2011, the Company held $198 million of available for sale municipal bonds and advance refunded or escrowed-to-maturity bonds collectively referred to as pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest. These investments are recorded at fair value which approximates cost and interest earned on these is realized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of December 31, 2011, the Company held $150 million of short-term bond mutual funds, which are classified as short-term available for sale investments. Unrealized losses on these investments that are considered temporary are recorded in AOCI.These securities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets. As of December and January 31, 2011, the Company held $29 million and $51 million of preferred stock investments, respectively, which are classified as available for sale securities. These securities are valued based on quoted prices in inactive markets. The Company recorded an unrealized gain net of tax of $05 million and $03 million, as of December and January 31, 2011, respectively, in AOCI.  62 Return to Top Also included in long-term investments are certificates of deposit that are held as collateral for the Companys outstanding standby letters of credit and for foreign operations of $21 million as of December and January 31, 2011.These investments are recorded at fair value which approximates cost and interest earned on these isrecorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company holds a $04 million investment obtained through its ViSalus acquisition. This investment was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and was adjusted by the Company proportionate share of investee earnings or loss. As of December 31, 2011, the Company accounts for this investment on a cost basis under ASC 325 as a result of changes in its ownership structure.This investment involves related parties as discussed in Note 16. In addition to the investments noted above, the Company holds mutual funds as part of a deferred compensation plan which are classified as available for sale. As of December and January 31, 2011, the fair value of these securities was $08 million and $10 million, respectively. These securities are valued based on quoted prices in an active market. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are recorded in AOCI. These mutual funds are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table summarizes the proceeds and realized gains on the sale of available for sale investments recorded in Foreign exchange and other within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the year ended January 31, 2011.

Note 8. Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign denominated inventory purchases, net assets of our foreign operations, intercompany payables and loans. It does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.The Company has hedged the net assets of certain of its foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts. The realized and unrealized gains/losses on these hedges are recorded within AOCI until the investment is sold or disposed of. As of December 31, 2011, there were no outstanding net investment hedges. The cumulative net after-tax gain related to net investment hedges in AOCI as of December and
January 31, 2011 was $56 million.  63 Return to Top The Company has designated its foreign currency forward contracts related to certain foreign denominated loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges.The gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge. The Company has designated forward exchange contracts on forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and future purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in AOCI until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged. Upon settlement of each commitment, the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from AOCI and is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset upon sale.If a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity, gains and
losses are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is settled.However, if the hedged item is probable of not occurring, the resultant gain or loss on the terminated hedge is recognized into earnings immediately.The net after-tax unrealized gain included inAOCI at December 31, 2011 for cash flow hedges is $04 million and is expected to be transferred into earnings within the next twelve months upon settlement of the underlying commitment. The net after-tax loss included inAOCI at January 31, 2011 for cash flow hedges was $01 million. For financial statement presentation, net cash flows from such hedges are classified in the categories of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows with the items being hedged. Forward contracts held with each bank are presented within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a net asset or liability, based on netting agreements with each bank and whether the forward contracts are in a net gain or loss position. The foreign exchange contracts outstanding have maturity dates through September 2012.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles Goodwill is subject to an assessment for impairment using a two-step fair value-based test and, as such, other intangibles are also subject to impairment reviews, which must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite- lived intangibles might be impaired. In the second quarter of the year ended January 31, 2010, the ViSalus business, within the Direct Selling segment, revised downward its revenues forecast for the current fiscal year as a result of lower demand for its product reflecting lower consumer spending attributed to the domestic economic recession and a higher than anticipated attrition rate in its promoter base. These factors together required management to focus its efforts on stabilizing its promoter base and curtailing its international expansion plans. Accordingly, management reduced its short-term and long-term forecasts in response to the weakening demand for its products. The impairment analysis performed indicated that the goodwill in ViSalus was
fully impaired, as its fair value was less than its carrying value, including goodwill. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $132 million, during the second quarter of the year ended January 31, 2010. The gross value of goodwill was $155 million in the Direct Selling segment. As of December and January 31, 2011, the carrying amount of the Companys goodwill within the Direct Selling segment was $23 million. Other intangible assets include indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks and customer relationships related to the Companys acquisition of Miles Kimball, Walter Drake and As We Change, which are reported in the Catalog and Internet segment; and other intangible assets of ViSalus, which is reported in the Direct Selling segment. In connection with the ViSalus goodwill impairment analysis performed for the second quarter of the year ended January 31, 2010, the Company also analyzed and recorded additional impairment charges totaling $31 million, for certain of the Companys trade names. This impairment was the result of a downward revision of its revenue forecast, lower consumer spending and higher than anticipated attrition rate in its distributor base. During the year ended January 31, 2011, the Exposures brand under the Miles Kimball business, within the Catalog Internet segment, experienced substantial declines in revenues when compared to its forecasts and prior years. The Company believes this shortfall in revenue was primarily attributable to decreased consumer spending, due to changes in the business environment and adverse economic conditions. As a result of the impairment analysis performed, the indefinite-lived trade name in this brand was determined to be partially impaired, as the fair value of this brand was less than its carrying value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $03 million resulting in a carrying
value of $14 million. During the eleven months ended December 31, 2011, The Home Marketplaces catalog under the Miles Kimball business, within the Catalog Internet segment, was discontinued. Accordingly, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $02 million to eliminate the carrying value of the intangible. The indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks were valued at $85 million and $86 million as of December 31, 2011 and January 31, 2011, respectively.The Company does not amortize the indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks, but rather tests for impairment annually as of January 31, and upon the occurrence of a triggering event. The gross value of all indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks by segment was $281 million in the Catalog Internet segment and $42 million in the Direct Selling segment. The gross value of all customer relationships by segment was $154 million in the Catalog Internet segment and $03 million in the Direct Selling segment.  65 Return to Top Other intangible assets include the following  Direct Selling Segment Catalog Internet Segment Total In thousands Indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks Indefinite-lived trade names and trademarks Customer

The weighted average remaining life of the Companys customer lists was 27 years at December 31, 2011. Note 10.Fair Value Measurements The fair-value hierarchy established in ASC 820prioritizes the inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels as follows 
Level-1 Observable inputs quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities 
Level-2 Observable inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities such as quoted prices for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data 
Level-3 Unobservable inputs includes amounts derived from valuation models where one or more significant inputs are unobservable and require the Company to develop relevant assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following tables summarizes thefinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as ofDecember 31, 2011 and January 31, 2011, and the basis for that measurement, by level within the fair value hierarchy In thousands Balance as of

The Company recorded a charge of $13 million for the fiscal year ended January 2011 representing the difference between its par and liquidated value. The Company values its investments in equity securities within the deferred compensation plan and its investments in short term bond mutual funds using level 1 inputs, by obtaining quoted prices in active markets.The deferred compensation plan assets consist of shares of mutual funds. The Company also enters into both cash flow and fair value hedges by purchasing foreign currency exchange forward contracts. These contracts are valued using level 2 inputs, primarily observable forward foreign exchange rates. The Company values its preferred stock and pre-refunded bond investments using information classified as level 2. This data consists of quoted prices of identical instruments in an inactive market and
third party bid offers. The certificates of deposit that are used to collateralize some of the Companys letters of credit have been valued using information classified as level 2, as these are not traded on the open market and are held unsecured by one counterparty. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and trade payables are considered to be representative of their respective fair values. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company is required, on a non-recurring basis, to adjust the carrying value or provide valuation allowances for certain assets using fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. The Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles and other assets. These assets are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis; however, they are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence that impairment may exist. As of December 31, 2011, there were no indications or circumstances indicating that an impairment might exist. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or sooner if circumstances indicate a condition of impairment may exist. The valuation uses assumptions such as interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. These valuation methods require a significant degree of management judgment concerning the use of internal and external data. In the event these methods indicate that fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is recorded at fair value as determined by the valuation models. As such, the Company classifies goodwill and other intangibles subjected to nonrecurring fair value adjustments as
level3.  67 Return to Top The fair value of the Companys long-lived assets, primarily property, plant and equipment is reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of a long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Management determines whether there has been an impairment of long-lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset.The amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value.Long-lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount
or net realizable value.Assets or asset groups are determined at the lowest level possible for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For assets whose aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value, the assets are considered potentially impaired and actual impairments, if any, would be determined to the extent the assets carrying value exceeds its aggregate fair values. During the eleven months ended December 31, 2011,indefinite-lived intangibles, were written down to $85 million from their carrying value of $87 million. During the year ended January 31, 2011, indefinite-lived intangibles, were written down to $87 million from their carrying value of $90 million, and property, plant and equipment was written down to $899 million from its carrying value of $907 million. The valuation of these assets uses a significant amount of managements judgment and uses information provided by third parties. The local real estate market, regional comparatives, estimated concessions and transaction costs are all considered when determining the fair value of these assets. Due to the nature of this information and the assumptions made by management the Company has classified the inputs used in valuing these assets as level 3.

Such notes contain among other provisions, restrictions on liens on principal property or stock issued to collateralize debt. As of December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with such provisions. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1. The notes
may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time at a specified redemption price. The proceeds of the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes.  68 Return to Top As of December and January 31, 2011, Miles Kimball had approximately $67 million and $72 million, respectively, of long-term debt outstanding under a real estate mortgage note payable which matures June 1, 2020.Under the terms of the note, payments of principal and interest are required monthly at a fixed interest rate of 789%.

The estimated fair value of the Companys $999 million and $1108 million total long-term debt including current portion at December and January 31, 2011 was approximately $1020 million and $1101 million, respectively.The fair value of the liability is determined using the fair value of its notes when traded as an asset in an inactive market and is based on current interest rates, relative credit risk and time to maturity. Due to the nature of the information used, the Company considers these to be level 2 measurements. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total of $20 million available under an uncommitted bank facility to be used for letters of credit. The issuance of letters of credit under this facility will be available until January 31, 2012.As of December 31, 2011, no amount was outstanding under this facility. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $18 million in standby letters of credit outstanding that are collateralized with a certificate of deposit. Note 13.Employee Benefit Plans The Company has defined contribution employee benefit plans in both the United States and certain of its foreign locations, covering substantially all eligible non-union employees.Contributions to all such plans are principally at the Companys discretion.Total expense related to all defined contribution plans in the United States for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was $23 million, $25 million and $25 million, respectively. Certain of the Companys non-U.S. subsidiaries provide pension benefits to employees or participate in government sponsored programs.The cost of these plans or government sponsored programs was $17 million $18 million and $20 million for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Most employees outside the United States are covered by government sponsored and administered programs. Other contributions to government-mandated programs are not expected to be significant. The Company entered into an employment agreement with its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Goergen, dated as of August 1, 2000. This contract has been amended and restated from time to time to extend his term of employment and provide other benefits. Benefits pursuant to the agreement have been funded by a purchased annuity contract.  69 Return to Top Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies In prior years, a state department of revenue proposed to assess additional corporate income taxes on the Company for fiscal years 2002 through 2009.In November, 2011, the Company finalized these audits with the state department of revenue covering the fiscal years 2002 through 2009.As a result of the settlement, a payment was made and charged against the previously established reserves.No additional tax liability exists for these audits. The Company utilizes operating and capital leases for a portion of its facilities and equipment.Generally, the leases provide that the Company pay real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance and other occupancy expenses applicable to leased premises.Certain leases provide for renewal for various periods at stipulated rates. The minimum future rental commitments under operating and capital leases are as follows In thousands For the fiscal years ending December 31 2012 11,861 2013 6,895 2014 5,821 2015 4,612 2016 3,589 and thereafter 5,994 Total minimum payments required 38,772 Rent expense for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was $100 million, $126 million and $121 million, respectively. Pursuant to the employment agreement identified above, upon the death of both Mr. Goergen and his spouse, the Company will, upon the demand of the estate of either Mr. Goergen or his spouse, buy back from such estate up to 1,875,000 shares of Company Common Stock within 90 days of such demand at the fair market value thereof as defined in the employment agreement or register the public offer and sale by such estate of up to 1,875,000 shares of Common Stock.In connection with the employment agreement, the Company and Mr. Goergen entered into a registration rights agreement relating to the registration of up to 1,875,000 shares of Common Stock as described above in the event that the Company chooses not
to purchase such shares upon the death of both Mr. Goergen and his spouse.There is no specified effective date or stock price requirement in the agreements and the Companys only obligation is to use its best efforts to have the registration become effective.The Company will not be obligated to purchase or register such shares, notwithstanding the death of both Mr. Goergen and his spouse, if the survivors estate, or his or her beneficiaries, as the case may be, can then sell all of the shares of the common stock owned by them without registration.At December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded a liability of approximately $02 million related to the estimated future costs to register the securities. Included within Other current assets on the Companys December 31, 2011 consolidated balance sheet is restricted cash ofapproximately $10 million which is being held by a third party bank in connection with a dispute with a former credit card processor.The Company is pursuing release of these funds and we expect the balance will be remitted to the Company within the year. The Company has contingent liabilities that have arisen in the ordinary course of its business, including pending litigation.The Company believes the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

As of December31, 2011, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards, which consisted of approximately $61million of U.S. federal net operating losses limited to IRC section 382 that will expire on December31, 2022, $1461million of U.S. state net operating losses that will begin to expire in 2013, and
foreign net operating losses of $212million, which will begin to expire in 2012. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a $119million U.S. capital loss carryforward which will begin to expire in 2013.Finally, the Company has state deferred tax assets of $10 million, that due to the fact that the businesses that these assets relate to have a history of net operating losses, it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized. As of December 31, 2011, the Company determined that $2125 million of undistributed foreign earnings were not reinvested indefinitely by its non-U.S. subsidiaries.An accumulated deferred tax liability has been recorded against these undistributed earnings of $133 million, a decrease of $113 million over the prior year. Of the current year change,$85 million was recorded as abenefit in the current period. As of December 31, 2011, undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered permanently reinvested, for which deferred income taxes have not been provided, were approximately $924 million. Determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were remitted is not practicable. A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes to the amount computed at the federal statutory rate is as follows  For the eleven months ended For the years ended In thousands December 31, 2011 January 31, 2011 January 31, 2010 Tax at statutory rate 10,367 14,798 11,021 Tax effect of U.S. state income taxes, net of federal benefit 86 419 299 Tax exempt interest 9 33 23 Permanent differences 1,840 212 306 Non-consolidated losses earnings 921 Valuation allowance reduction on non-consolidated NOL carryforward 2,287 224 Valuation allowance movement on capital loss carryforward 313 455 567 Change in reserve for tax contingencies 2,317 591 8,413 Non-deductible goodwill impairment 4,617 Foreign dividend and subpart F income 21,278 16,808 8,880 Tax benefit on undistributed foreign earnings 8,465 2,802 7,207 Foreign tax rate differential 11,956 14,219 14,551 Other 28 35 70  8,024 14,708 9,015 The following is a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, during the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 In thousands Balance as of February 1, 2011 12,211 Gross increases tax positions prior periods Gross decreases tax positions prior periods 2,987 Gross increases tax positions current period Gross decreases tax positions current period Decreases settlements with taxing authorities 5,877 Reductions - lapse of statute of limitations 442 Balance as of December 31, 2011 2,905  72 Return to Top As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $29 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties. This amount represents the portion that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.As of December 31, 2011, the Company had $42 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. Penalties and interest in the amount of $01 million and $06 million adversely impacted the current year and prior year tax rate.As of January 31, 2011, the Company had $69 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. Due to the various jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns and the uncertainty regarding the timing of the settlement of tax audits, it is possible that there could be other significant changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits in 2012, but the amount cannot be estimated. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions.The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The Companys major taxing jurisdictions include the United States including the state jurisdictions of Connecticut, Illinois and Massachusetts, Canada, Germany and Switzerland. In the United States, the Company is currently open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2009 through 2011 and is currently under audit for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011.Additionally, in Canada and Germany the Company is open to examination for fiscal
years 2008 through 2011 and is currently under audit in Canada for fiscal years ended January 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011. In Switzerland, the Company is open to examination for years ended 2008 thru 2010. In prior years, a state department of revenue proposed to assess additional corporate income taxes on the Company for fiscal years 2002 through 2009. In November 2011, the Company finalized these audits with the state department of revenue covering the fiscal years 2002 through 2009.As a result of the settlement, payment was made and charged against the previously established reserves.No additional tax liability exists for these audits. Note 16. Related Party Transactions As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the acquisition of ViSalus in October 2008 involved related parties.

Stock-Based Compensation Summary of Plans As of January 31, 2011, the Company had one active stock-based compensation plan, the Amended and Restated 2003 Omnibus Incentive Plan 2003 Plan, available to grant future awards. In addition, the Company maintains two inactive stock-based compensation plans the Amended and Restated 1994 Employee Stock Option Plan and the Amended and Restated 1994 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors, under which vested and unexercised options remain outstanding. There were 1,020,449 shares authorized for grant under these plans as of December 31, 2011, and there were approximately 795,345 shares available for grant under these plans. The Companys policy is to issue new shares of common stock for all
stock options exercised and restricted stock grants.  73 Return to Top  The Board of Directors and the stockholders of the Company have approved the adoption and subsequent amendments of the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan provides for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, dividend equivalents and other stock unit awards to officers and employees. The 2003 Plan also provides for grants ofnonqualified stock options to directors of the Company who are not, and who have not been during the immediately preceding 12-month period, officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Restricted stock and restricted stock units RSUs are granted to
certain employees to incent performance and retention. RSUs issued under these plans provide that shares awarded may not be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions have lapsed. The release of RSUs on each of the vesting dates is contingent upon continued active employment by the employee until the vesting dates. A total of 43,444 RSUs were granted during the eleven months ended December 31, 2011. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock and RSUs based on estimated fair values. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 included compensation expense for restricted stock, RSUs and stock-based awards granted subsequent to January 31, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, CompensationStock Compensation ASC 718. The Company recognizes these compensation costs net of a
forfeiture rate for only those awards expected to vest, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is over periods of 3 years for stock options; 2 to 5 years for employee restricted stock and RSUs; and 1 to 2 years for non-employee restricted stock and RSUs. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Transactions related to restricted stock and RSUs are summarized as follows Shares Weighted Average

The total recognized tax benefit for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $05 million, $07 million and $09 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of restricted stock and RSUs vested for the eleven months ended December and the year ended January 31, 2011 was $24 million and $12 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock and RSUs granted during the eleven months ended
December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $48, $47 and $33 per share, respectively. The average grant date fair value of restricted stock and RSUs vested for the eleven months ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010 was approximately $46, $67 and $88 per share, respectively.  74 Return to Top As of December 31, 2011, there was $14 million of unearned compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock and RSU awards.This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 18 years.The total unrecognized stock-based compensation cost to be recognized in future periods as of December 31, 2011 does not consider the effect of stock-based awards that may be issued in subsequent periods.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the Companys closing stock price on the last trading day for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on December 31, 2011. Intrinsic value will change in future periods based on the fair market value of the Companys stock and the number of shares outstanding. There were no grants or exercises in the eleven months ended December 31, 2011, or the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010. Note 18. Earnings Per Share Vested restricted stock units issued under the Companys stock-based compensation plans participate in a cash equivalent of the dividends paid to common shareholders and are not considered contingently issuable shares. Accordingly, these RSUs are included in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share as common stock equivalents. RSUs that have not vested and are subject to a risk of forfeiture are included solely in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2011. b Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The objective of this assessment is to determine whether our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. Based on our assessment utilizing the criteria issued by COSO, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. The report appears herein below. c Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph d of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the period ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We have audited Blyth, Inc. and Subsidiaries the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2011 and January 31, 2011, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the eleven month period ended December 31, 2011 and the years ended January 31, 2011 and 2010, and our report dated March 14, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
