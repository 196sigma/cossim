32             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Concentra Corporation   We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Concentra
Corporation as of March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity deficit and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended March 31, 1997. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Concentra
Corporation as of March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
March 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                        /s/ COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P.

CONCENTRA CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A. NATURE OF BUSINESS
Description of Business
Concentra Corporation, formerly ICAD, Inc. the Company was incorporated
in April 1984 and operates in one business segment. The Company develops,
markets and supports software products that automate the engineering and sales
process.
The Company is subject to a number of risks similar to other companies in
the industry, including dependence on two principal products, concentration of
customers, competition from substitute products and larger companies, rapid
technological change, uncertainty of market acceptance of products, dependence
on third-party licensed technology and proprietary technology, dependence on
key personnel, dependence on domestic and international distributors and
resellers, the need to obtain additional financing, and the risks associated
with international operations.
The Company has experienced and may experience in the future significant
quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in its operating results. Factors such as the
timing of significant orders, the timing of new product introductions and
upgrades, the length of customer product evaluation periods, the mix of products
sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenues could contribute to
this quarterly variability. A substantial portion of the Company revenues in a
quarter are derived from purchase orders received in that quarter, which makes
the Company financial performance more susceptible to an unexpected downturn
in business and more unpredictable. In addition, the Company expenses levels
are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels and a shortfall in
expected revenues could therefore result in a disproportionate decrease in the
Company net income.
B. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Use of Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and would
impact financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Those
instruments with maturities between three months and twelve months are
considered to be short-term marketable securities and investments with
maturities of greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable
securities.
Cash equivalents, which include debt securities, are carried at amortized
cost plus accrued interest which approximates fair value.                    37

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Upon being subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, the Company
classified a previously owned common stock investment as a trading security.
Trading securities are carried at their fair market value based upon the quoted
market prices in effect at the balance sheet date. Net unrealized gains on
trading securities of approximately $203,000 are included in other income
expense for the year ended March 31, 1997.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives       Computer equipment              3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures            5-7 years
Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leasehold
improvements or the remaining term of the lease.
Expenditures for maintenance, repairs and renewals that neither materially
add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to
expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and
related allowances for depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Research and Development and Capitalized Software Costs
Costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are
charged to research and development expense. Software production costs incurred
subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized
until the product is available for general release to customers. Amortization of
capitalized software costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
estimated economic lives of the related products of three years, which amount is
greater than the amount computed using the ratio of current gross revenues for a
product to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that
product.
Amortization of capitalized software costs, included in cost of software
licenses, amounted to approximately $360,000, $290,000 and $174,000 for the
years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets, which represent various software licenses, are recorded
at cost and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of three to five
years. Amortization of intangible assets amounted to approximately $995,000 317,000 and $141,000 for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively, and are included in cost of software licenses.
During 1995, the Company entered into a five year software license
agreement with a significant customer and marketing partner. The agreement
required an upfront fee of $1,000,000, as well as additional payments See Note
E for the use of software which is embedded in certain of the Company
products. This asset is being amortized over the five year life of the
agreement.                    38

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Revenue Recognition
Revenue from software license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the
license provided that no significant vendor obligations remain outstanding and
collection of the related receivable is deemed probable by management. Revenue
from annual or multi-year maintenance agreements, including maintenance bundled
in initial software licenses, is recognized ratably over the term of the
agreements. Revenue from consulting and training agreements is recognized as the
services are performed.
Income Taxes
The Company provides taxes for income based on the liability method, which
requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred taxes are determined
based on the difference between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities
and the corresponding financial reporting amounts using enacted tax rates in
effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The
Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based
upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Foreign Currency
Assets and liabilities of the Company foreign subsidiaries are translated
at the exchange rates in effect at year end. Revenues and expenses are
translated using currency exchange rates in effect during the year. Gains or
losses resulting from translation adjustments are reported as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Foreign exchange losses gains resulting
from intercompany foreign currency transactions of approximately $166,000 38,000 and $308,000 for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, are included in other income and expense.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist of temporary cash investments and trade
receivables.
The Company invests its cash balances with banks and other financial
institutions. As of March 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had $0 and $3,962,000,
respectively, of cash equivalents invested in commercial paper which are
considered to be cash equivalents due to their short-term maturity. The Company
also has cash equivalents which are comprised of a repurchase agreement with a
bank and U.S. Treasury Securities. The carrying amount of these cash equivalents
approximates fair value because of their short-term maturity. The Company does
not require collateral on its repurchase agreements.
Credit risk with respect to trade receivables is concentrated due to the
limited amount of large orders recorded in any particular reporting period. The
Company regularly extends payment terms with new and existing customers to close
business in a particular reporting period. The Company does not require
collateral, letters of credit, or other security to support customer
receivables. The Company credit review procedures are generally more limited
for overseas customers and the Company has experienced greater credit losses
with such overseas customers than anticipated. In some cases, the Company does
have private foreign credit insurance to protect against foreign credit losses.
Due to the factors discussed above, it is reasonably possible that the Company
estimate for doubtful accounts could differ from actual experience and adversely
impact the Company financial position, results of operations and cash flows.                    39

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
Net Income Loss Per Common and Common Equivalent Share
Net income loss per common and common equivalent share is based upon the
weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding.
Common equivalent shares are included in the per share calculations where the
effect of their inclusion would be dilutive.
In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 83 SAB No. 83, all common and common equivalent shares issued
during the twelve month period prior to the initial public offering cheap
stock which was completed on February 6, 1995, have been included in the
calculation as if they were outstanding for all periods. As permitted under SAB
No. 83, these common equivalent shares, which consist of stock options, were
determined using the treasury stock method and the initial public offering
IPO price of $1200 per share. In the computation of net income loss per
common and common equivalent share, accretion of redeemable common stock is
included as a decrease in net income or increase in net loss available to common
stockholders. Series A Preferred Stock is not considered a common stock
equivalent based on its effective yield to maturity.
Fully diluted net income loss per common and common equivalent share did
not differ materially from primary net income loss per common and common
equivalent share.
Newly Issued Accounting Standards
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share SFAS 128,
which is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1997, including
interim periods. Earlier application is not permitted. However, an entity is
permitted to disclose pro forma earnings per share amounts computed using SFAS
128 in the notes to financial statement in periods prior to adoption. SFAS 128
requires restatement of all prior-period earnings per share data presented upon
adoption. SFAS 128 specifies the computation, presentation and disclosure
requirements for earnings per share and is substantially similar to the standard
recently issued by the International Accounting Standards Committee entitled
International Accounting Standard, Earnings per Share IAS 33. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS 128 in the fourth quarter of 1997 and has not yet
determined the impact.

Line of Credit
On June 20, 1996, the Company renewed its demand line of credit of
$2,500,000 with a commercial bank pursuant to the terms under the unsecured
working capital line of credit. This line of credit bears interest at the bank
base lending rate, and expires on June 30, 1997. There were no amounts
outstanding under the working capital line of credit at March 31, 1997 or 1996.
The line of credit contains financial covenants which consist of minimum
tangible capital base, ratio of total liabilities to tangible capital base and
debt service coverage. The Company is currently in violation of these covenants
and is negotiating with the commercial lender to extend and amend the demand
line of credit. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
extending and amending the line of credit nor can there be any assurance that
such extended and amended line of credit will be on similar terms as the
existing agreement. Additionally, there can be no assurance that alternative
funding will be available if required.                    41

Capital and Operating Leases
The Company has a $1,750,000 equipment line of credit, collateralized by
the equipment, bearing interest at the bank base lending rate and expired on
March 31, 1997. The Company is currently negotiating with the commercial lender
to extend and amend the equipment line of credit. As of March 1997, the Company
purchased $1,322,000 of furniture and computer equipment under the equipment
line of credit.
The Company has entered into certain operating lease agreements for
computer equipment and its office and sales facilities, expiring through fiscal
2001. The Company also leases certain computer equipment and furniture and
fixtures under capital leases. Under the terms of certain operating lease
agreements, the Company may be required to pay for utilities, real estate taxes,
insurance and maintenance expenses.
On June 2, 1995, the Company signed a new five year operating lease for its
corporate headquarters. The terms of the new lease provide that the Company will
make annual rental payments of approximately $202,000.   At March 31, 1997, approximate future minimum lease payments under capital

Royalty and Consulting Arrangements
During fiscal 1996 the Company entered into a $5,000,000 five year
applications consulting services contract with a significant customer of the
Company. The five year applications consulting services contract contains
volume pricing discounts subject to adjustments for increased costs. The
Company has a minimum commitment of $2,500,000 for outside applications
services that will be used by the Company over a five year period. The minimum
commitment of $2,500,000 will be paid in five yearly payments commencing
December 31, 1996. These yearly payments are $250,000, $500,000, $550,000 600,000 and $600,000 for the five calendar years beginning December 31, 1996,
respectively. The Company policy is to recognize the consulting service
expenses as the expenses are incurred. The Company believes that based on
current forecasts the minimum payment accruals will be utilized. However, given
the significant sales fluctuations which may occur in any given period, it is
possible that the minimum commitment would not be met, thus requiring the
Company to record a charge in excess of the services utilized. At March 31,
1997, the Company did not use the minimum first-year commitment of $250,000 and
has recorded an asset for the unused portion, that can be carried forward under
the contract, of $88,000. The Company has included such amount in other current
assets and expects to recognize this amount, along with the fiscal 1998 minimum
commitment, during the next fiscal year. Pursuant to this reciprocal buying
agreement, the Company recognized revenue and collected cash in the amount of
$1,805,000 upon the execution and delivery of software with respect to the
software license agreement for the year ended March 31, 1996.
During fiscal 1995 the Company entered into a five year license and royalty
agreement, as amended, with a significant customer and marketing partner of the
Company See Note H. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company recognized revenue
and collected cash in the amount of $1,000,000 upon the execution and delivery
of software with respect to this software license arrangement. In addition, the
Company, in connection with an arrangement to license a software module from
this significant customer, has paid $1,000,000 in prepaid royalties to be
amortized over the life of the five year agreement, commencing January 1, 1995.
Also, during fiscal 1996 the Company paid additional royalty amounts of
$1,000,000 in four quarterly installments. The Company amortizes these
additional royalty payments to cost of software licenses based upon
predetermined percentages of revenues generated from the sale of product.

The Company has recognized approximately $104,000 and $452,000 in service
revenues during fiscal 1997 and 1996 respectively under the aforementioned fixed
fee arrangements. The Company has deferred revenue for the product enhancement
privileges which include and extend to any replacement products introduced prior
to installation of the respective licenses. The deferred amounts were determined
using the Company standard European maintenance fee. These fees are being
amortized over three years based upon the Distributor contract term of three

master versions of the licensed products. There is no right of refund or
adjustment to the amounts received or remaining significant obligations.
I. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY DEFICIT
Preferred Stock
On November 18, 1994, the Board of Directors authorized 4,000,000 shares of
$01 par value Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to
certain limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder approval, to
issue from time to time up to an aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock in one or more series and to fix the designations, preferences,
qualifications and limitations on restrictions of the shares of each said
series, including the dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking
fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive
rights and the number of shares constituting any series.
Preferred Share Purchase Rights
On April 21, 1997, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one Right
for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $000001 per share, of the
Company. The Rights were distributed on April 24, 1997, to holders of record on
that date. The rights will expire on April 24, 2007. Each Right will entitle
shareholders to buy 1/1000 of a share of Series A preferred stock at an exercise
price of $3000. Initially, no separate Rights certificates will be distributed.
The Rights will trade with the Company Common Stock and will not be
exercisable until one of the following conditions occur: 1 the Company receives
notice of the acquisition of 20 percent or more of the Company Common Stock by
a person or group; or 2 such date as the Company Board of Directors
determines following the commencement of a tender offer for 20 percent or more
of the Company Common Stock. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, the
Rights can be redeemed at any time prior to the date that the Rights become
exercisable. If the Rights are not redeemed by the Board, and the Company is
acquired, holders of the Rights other than an Acquiring Person will be
entitled to purchase shares of Preferred Stock of the Company equivalent to
shares of Common Stock having a fair market value of twice the exercisable
price.
Stock Options
On September 15, 1987 and June 11, 1993, the Board of Directors and
stockholders approved the Company 1987 Stock Plan and 1993 Stock Plan the
Plans, respectively. The Plans provide for the granting of incentive stock
options to officers and employees, to purchase shares of the Company common
stock at a price not less than fair value, as determined by the Board of
Directors, on the grant date. The Plans also provide for the granting of
non-qualified stock options or awards of Common Stock to employees, officers and
directors of and consultants to the Company. Options expire 10 years from the
date of grant. Certain executive officers have options that vest eight years
from the date of grant. If certain performance targets are met, 20% of these
options will vest linearly over three years annually from the time of
achievement so long as the executive officer continues to be employed by the
Company. At March 31, 1997, 1,794,477 shares of Common Stock are reserved for

amounts required for fiscal 1995. The pro forma effect of the compensation cost
determined using the fair value-base method are not indicative of future amounts
when the new method will apply to all vested and non-vested awards.
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In computing these pro forma amounts,
the Company has assumed weighted-average assumptions used for grants in 1997 and
1996, respectively; dividend yield of 00%; expected volatility of 80 percent;
weighted average risk-free interest rates of 596% and 596%; and expected lives
of five years. The average fair value of the options granted during 1997 and
1996 is estimated as $384 and $623, respectively, on the date of the grant.
Fixed Stock Option Plans
The Company has two fixed option plans. Under the 1987 Employee Stock
Option Plan, the Company may grant options to its employees for up to 909,091
shares of common stock. Under the 1993 Employee Stock Option Plan, the Company
may grant options to its employees for up to 1,159,091 shares of common stock.
Under the plans, the exercise price of each option equals the market price of
the Company stock on the date of grant and option maximum term is 10 years.

J. FOURTH QUARTER ADJUSTMENTS AND CHARGES
The Company recorded net adjustments affecting revenues and receivables of
approximately $1,544,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997. Of this amount 1,026,000 relates to an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts which
the Company recorded after repeated unsuccessful attempts were made to collect
certain receivables. This provision is principally made up of one large domestic
receivable and two international receivables. Notwithstanding this fourth
quarter provision, the Company is continuing to pursue collection of these
receivables. The remaining $518,000 relates to a sale recorded in the first
quarter to a new customer. This customer experienced turnover of the key officer
who committed their respective company to the license agreement. In the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company reversed this sale based upon the customer
refusal to honor the prior contract.
The Company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $239,000 in
the fourth quarter consisting of severance costs associated with the termination
of fourteen employees for fiscal 1997. At March 31, 1997, the outstanding unpaid
balance of $216,000 is included in accrued expenses.
The Company also recorded in other income a gain of $203,000 based upon
classifying a common stock investment as a trading security.
