Financial Statement Schedules 2 Financial statement schedules have been omitted because either
they are not applicable or the required information is included
in the financial statements or the notes thereto. 28 REPORT OF MANAGEMENT Managements Responsibility for Financial Statements Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of
the consolidated financial statements and related information.
The statements are prepared in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles consistently
applied and include certain amounts based on managements
best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information
elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the
financial statements. In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the
financial information, management maintains a system of internal
accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit
program. The system of controls provides for appropriate
division of responsibility and the application of written
policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual
reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that
assets are safeguarded and records are adequate for the
preparation of reliable financial data. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate controls over financial reporting. We maintain a system
of internal controls, although there are inherent limitations in
the effectiveness of any system of internal controls that is
designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and
reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the
Companys activities according to the highest standards of
personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is
characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for
all employees, and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief
Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in
other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed
solely of independent directors who are not employees of the
Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting
firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself
that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The
report of the Audit Committee is included in the Proxy Statement
of the Company for its 2005 Annual Meeting. Both the independent
registered public accounting firm and internal auditors have
direct access to the Audit Committee. The Companys independent registered public accounting
firm, Ernst Young LLP, are engaged to render an
opinion as to whether managements financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the Companys
financial position and results of operations. That report is
included on page31. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules13a-15f
and 15d-15f. Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004 based on the
framework in Internal Control Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. Based on that
evaluation, our management concluded that the Companys
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December31, 2004. Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as
stated in their report, which appears on page30. AMETEK, Inc. March4, 2005 29 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc. We have audited managements assessment, included in the
accompanying Report of Management
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting, that AMETEK, Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission the COSO criteria.
AMETEK, Inc.s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on managements assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and 3provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, managements assessment that AMETEK, Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion,
AMETEK, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of income, cash flows and stockholders equity
for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2004, and our report dated March4, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania March4, 2005 30 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of AMETEK, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
AMETEK, Inc. as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and
stockholders equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2004. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of AMETEK, Inc. at
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the
effectiveness of AMETEK, Inc.s internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March4, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/ ERNST YOUNG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania March4, 2005 31 AMETEK, Inc. Consolidated Statement of Income

1.
Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the
operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc.
the Company, and include the accounts of the
Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant
intercompany transactions in the consolidation. The
Companys investments in 50% or less owned joint ventures
are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Such
investments are not significant. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash Equivalents, Securities, and Other Investments All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased are considered cash equivalents. At
December31, 2004 and 2003, all of the Companys
equity securities and fixed-income securities primarily those
of a captive insurance subsidiary are classified as
available-for-sale, although the Company may hold
fixed-income securities until their maturity dates. Fixed-income
securities generally mature within four years. The aggregate
market value of equity and fixed income securities at
December31, 2004 and 2003 was: 2004
$187million $168million amortized cost and
2003 $148million $134million
amortized cost. The temporary unrealized gain or loss on such
securities is recorded as a separate component of other
comprehensive income in stockholders equity, and is not
material. The Company had no other-than-temporary impairment
losses in 2004. The Company recognized other-than-temporary
impairment losses against earnings of $07million in 2003
and $03million in 2002. Certain of the Companys
other investments are accounted for by the equity method. Accounts Receivable The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting
from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial
obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for doubtful
receivables is recorded against the amounts due from these
customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
reserves for doubtful receivables based on the length of time
specific receivables are past due based on its past experience.
The allowance for possible losses on receivables at
December31, 2004 was $76million, compared with
$79million at December31, 2003. See Note5. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost
being determined for more than half of inventories by the
last-in, first-out LIFO method of inventory valuation, and
market on the basis of the lower of replacement cost or
estimated net proceeds from sales. The excess of the first-in,
first-out FIFO value over the LIFO value at December31,
2004 and 2003 was $288million and $268million,
respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful
lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs, and dies,
and maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as
incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated
principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the related assets. 36 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued Revenue Recognition The Company generally recognizes revenue when products are
shipped and services are rendered. The policy with respect to
sales returns and allowances generally provides that a customer
may not return products, or be given allowances, except at the
Companys option. Accruals for sales returns, other
allowances, and estimated warranty costs are provided at the
time of shipment based upon past experience, and are adjusted
periodically to reflect actual expenses. The warranty periods
for products sold vary widely among the Companys
operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The
Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past
warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to
reflect actual warranty expenses. At December31, 2004 and
2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was
$73million and $69million, respectively. Research and Development Company-funded research and development costs are charged to
operations as incurred and during the past three years were:
2004 $255million, 2003
$214million, and 2002 $237million. Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the
effect of all potentially dilutive securities primarily
outstanding common stock options. The following table presents
the number of shares used in the calculation of basic earnings
per share and diluted earnings per share

Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated
using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and
their results of operations are translated using average
exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are
made in currencies other than their functional currency.
Exchange gains and losses from those transactions generally are
included in operating results for the year. Where those
transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the
gains and losses on those transactions are deferred in other
comprehensive income within stockholders equity to the
extent they are effective as hedges. Stock-Based Compensation SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation and SFASNo148, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation Transition and
Disclosures, which amends SFAS123, encourage entities
to recognize compensation expense for stock-based employee
compensation plans at fair value, but provide the option of
measuring compensation expense using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25,
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB25.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance
with APB25. The exercise price of stock options, set at
the time of the grant, is not less than the fair market value
per share at the date of the grant. Had the Company applied the
fair value recognition provisions of SFAS123, pretax
stock-based compensation expense would have increased
$51million, $49million, and $45million for
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Diluted earnings per share 37 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued would have been lower by $004 for 2004 and 2003, and $003 for
2002. Options generally have a four year full vesting period
from the date of grant. Note9 presents pro forma results
of operations as if SFAS123 had been used to account for
stock-based compensation plans. Derivative Financial Instruments The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial
instruments to manage interest rate, foreign exchange, and
forward contract exposure. The Company does not hold or trade in
derivatives for speculative purposes. On the date a derivative
contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative
as either 1a fair value hedge, 2a cash flow
hedge, or 3a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
operation. Interest rate swap and cap agreements are accounted
for as cash flow hedges, and are sometimes used to manage the
interest rate characteristics of certain outstanding revolving
credit loans to a more desirable fixed or variable rate basis,
or to limit the Companys exposure to rising interest
rates. These swaps and caps are matched with the underlying
fixed or variable rate debt, and any periodic cash payments are
accrued on a settlement basis and accounted for as adjustments
to interest costs. There were no interest rate swap or cap
agreements in place at, or during the years ended,
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Qualifying
derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments are
accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item is
an investment in a foreign subsidiary. Foreign currency forward
contracts are entered into from time to time to hedge specific
firm commitments for certain inventory purchases or export
sales, thereby minimizing the Companys exposure to foreign
currency fluctuation. When present, all derivative financial
instruments are accounted for in accordance with
SFASNo133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. There was one forward
contract outstanding at December31, 2004, which was
acquired with one of the 2003 acquisitions, for the purchase of
certain inventories. The amount of the forward contract and the
gain recognized in earnings on the underlying transactions were
not material to the Company. At December31, 2004 and 2003,
the Company had $1727million and $893million,
respectively, of British-pound-denominated loans, which are
designated as a hedge against the net investment in foreign
subsidiaries acquired in 2004 and 2003. As a result of these
British Pound denominated loans being designated, and effective
as net investment hedges, approximately $101million and
$94million of currency losses have been included in the
translation adjustment in other comprehensive income at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets The Company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible
assets in accordance with SFASNo142 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets. Under SFASNo142,
purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives
are not amortized, rather, they are tested for impairment at
least annually. Intangible assets with finite lives will
continue to be amortized over their useful lives. Effective January1, 2002, the Company ceased the
amortization of goodwill in accordance with
SFASNo142. As of December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, goodwill by segment was: Electronic Instrument
Group EIG $3666million and
$3090million; Electromechanical Group EMG
$2344million and $1979million. The net increase in
goodwill in 2004 is primarily due to the acquisitions of Taylor
Hobson and Hughes-Treitler. In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives for impairment under SFASNo142, a
determination of the fair value of the Companys reporting
units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required
and is based upon, among other things, estimates of future
operating performance of the reporting unit being valued.
Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an
impact on these estimates. The Company completed its required
annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2004 and
determined that there was no impairment. 38 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stock Split On January27, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors
approved a two-for-one split of its common stock distributed on
February27, 2004, to shareholders of record on
February13, 2004. All share and per share amounts included
in this report reflect the stock split.   
3.
Accounting Pronouncements In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted FASB Financial
Interpretation No46-R FIN46-R,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
interpretation of Accounting Research
BulletinNo51, which replaced FIN46.
FIN46-R requires a company to consolidate a variable
interest entity VIE if it is designated as a
primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not
have a majority voting interest in the entity. A VIE is
generally defined as an entity in which equity investors do not
have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, or
do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance
its own activities without additional financial support from
other parties, or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of
ownership. The disclosure requirements of FIN46-R were
effective for financial statements issued after
December31, 2003. The initial recognition provisions of
FIN46-R relating to VIEs created or obtained prior
to February 2003 were to be implemented no later than the end of
the first reporting period that ends after March15, 2004.
Adoption of FIN46-R had no effect on the Companys
consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo123R,
Share-Based Payment, a revision to
SFASNo123, Accounting for Stock Based
Compensation and superseding Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees. SFASNo123R will
require the Company to expense the fair value of grants made
under its employee stock option plans. That cost will be
recognized over the vesting period of the grants.
SFASNo123R is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period after June15, 2005.
SFASNo123R permits companies to adopt its
requirements using either a modified prospective
method, or a modified retrospective method. Upon
adoption of SFASNo123R, amounts previously
disclosed under SFASNo123 will be recorded in the
consolidated statement of income. As more fully described in
Note1, the Company currently accounts for share-based
payments to employees using the intrinsic value method
prescribed in APB Opinion No25. The impact of adopting
SFASNo123R cannot be completely predicted at this
time because it will depend on, among other things, the level of
share-based payments granted in the future. The Company is still
assessing the effect of adopting SFAS123R and the
appropriate transition method. Also, the Company has not
determined whether the adoption of SFASNo123R
will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma
disclosures under SFASNo, 123 See Notes1 and 9. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFASNo151,
Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No43,
Chapter4. SFASNo151 amends the guidance in
ARB No43, Chapter4, Inventory Pricing,
to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility
expense, handling costs and wasted material spoilage. Among
other provisions, the new rule requires that such items be
recognized as current-period charges. SFASNo151 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June15, 2005.
The Company is still evaluating the effects of adopting SFAS
No151.   
4.
Acquisitions In 2004, the Company made two acquisitions. In June 2004, the
Company acquired Taylor Hobson Holdings Limited Taylor Hobson
for approximately 510million British pounds, or
$938million in cash 39 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued net of cash received. Taylor Hobson is a leading manufacturer of
ultraprecise measurement instrumentation for a variety of
markets, including optics, semiconductors, hard disk drives and
nanotechnology research. Taylor Hobson is a part of the
Companys Electronic Instruments Group. In July 2004, the
Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Hughes-Treitler Mfg. Corp. Hughes-Treitler for approximately
$480million in cash. Hughes-Treitler is a supplier of
heat exchangers and thermal management subsystems for the
aerospace and defense markets. Hughes-Treitler is a part of the
Companys Electromechanical Group. The aggregate purchase
price paid for the 2004 acquisitions is subject to adjustment
upon finalization of the value of the net assets acquired. The operating results of the above acquisitions are included in
the Companys consolidated results from their respective
dates of acquisition. The acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase
method in accordance with SFASNo141, Business
Combinations. The following table presents the preliminary
allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the 2004
acquisitions based on their estimated fair values

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefit
the Company expects to realize from expanding its measurement
instruments capabilities into ultraprecise applications through
Taylor Hobson and its thermal management systems offerings for
the aerospace market through Hughes-Treitler. The $375million in other assets was assigned to
intangibles, other than goodwill, primarily technology and
patents; with estimated lives up to 20years. The Company is in the process of completing third party
valuations of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired
with the new businesses. Therefore, the allocation of purchase
price to these acquisitions is subject to revision. In 2003, the Company made three acquisitions. In January 2003,
the Company acquired Airtechnology Holdings Limited
Airtechnology from Candover Partners Limited, for
approximately 50million British pounds, or about
$80million in cash. Airtechnology is a supplier of motors,
fans and environmental control systems for the aerospace and
defense markets. Airtechnology is a part of the Companys
Electromechanical Group. In February 2003, the Company acquired
Solidstate Controls, Inc. SCI from Marmon Industrial Companies
LLC for approximately $34million in cash. SCI is a leading
supplier of uninterruptible power supply systems for the process
and power generation industries. SCI is a part of the
Companys Electronic Instruments Group. In August 2003, the
Company acquired Chandler Instruments Company, LLC. Chandler
Instruments for approximately $49million in cash.
Chandler Instruments is a leading manufacturer of high-quality
measurement instrumentation for the oil and gas industry.
Chandler Instruments is a part of the Companys Electronic
Instruments Group. Had the acquisitions of Taylor Hobson and Hughes-Treitler been
made at the beginning of 2004, unaudited pro forma net sales,
net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended
December31, 2004 would not have been materially different

Flood Damage Gain In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company settled an insurance
claim in connection with a flood loss, which occurred at one of
its manufacturing plants in the third quarter of 2003. The flood
caused significant damage to the building, and the plants
operating assets. Since the occurrence of the flood, the Company
received insurance proceeds totaling $242million in
settlement of the damage claim and loss of these assets. Gross
cash proceeds totaling $197million, were received in
2004. Proceeds of $45million were received in 2003. The
portion of the claim relating to the building, its contents, and
the operating assets was finalized with the Companys
insurers in the third quarter of 2004 resulting in the
recognition of a pretax gain of $28million in that
quarter. The remaining portion of the insurance claim, which
related primarily to business interruption and other expenses
was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2004, resulting in the
recognition of an additional $25million pretax gain. The
total pretax gain recognized in 2004 from this insurance claim
was $53million and is included in operating income in the
consolidated statement of income. As a result of the flood, the
Company has decided to cease operations at this location. Plant
closure costs of $36million associated with this decision
were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2004, and have been
reflected in the determination of the gain. 42 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

$778million in 2011 and thereafter. In November 2004, the Company issued 40million British
pound $767million at December31, 2004 599%
senior note due in 2016. In September 2003, the Company issued
50million British pound $960million at
December31, 2004 596% senior note due in 2010. The Company has an unsecured $300million Revolving Credit
Facility that matures on February25, 2009. Interest rates
on outstanding loans under the Revolving Credit Facility are
either at the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBORplus a
negotiated spread over LIBOR, or at the U.S.prime rate. At
December31, 2004, the Company had no revolving credit
loans outstanding. At December31, 2004 2715million was unused and available under the Revolving
Credit Facility. The Company had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $285million at December31, 2004. The Revolving Credit Facility places certain restrictions on
allowable foreign debt, and the measurement of the pro forma
effect of potential acquisitions in certain debt covenant
compliance calculations. The Revolving Credit Facility also
places certain restrictions on certain cash payments, including
the payment of dividends. At December31, 2004, retained
earnings of approximately $272million were not subject to
the dividend limitation. The Companys accounts receivable financing agreement with
a bank provides for borrowings of up to $750million
against its trade accounts receivable. At December31, 2004
and 2003, $380million and $640million,
respectively, was used under this secured credit facility. The
weighted average interest rate on the amount outstanding under
the accounts receivable securitization during December31,
2004 and 2003 was 20% and 18%, respectively. Foreign subsidiaries of the Company had available credit
facilities with local foreign lenders of approximately
$447million. Foreign debt outstanding at
December31, 2004 was $135million including
$24million reported in long-term debt. The approximate weighted average interest rate, during the year,
on total debt outstanding at December31, 2004 and 2003 was
62% and 56%, respectively. 43 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Stockholders Equity In March 2003, the Companys Board of Directors authorized
a $50million share repurchase program, adding to the
remaining authorization under the 1998share repurchase
program. In 2004, the Company did not repurchase any shares of
its common stock under its current share repurchase
authorization, compared with repurchases of 380,000shares
at a total cost of $58million in 2003. At
December31, 2004, approximately $524million of the
current share purchase authorization was unexpended. At
December31, 2004, the Company held approximately
17million shares in its treasury at a cost of
$245million compared with approximately 21million
shares at a cost of $296million at the end of 2003. The
number of shares outstanding at December31, 2004 was
687million shares, compared with 670million shares
at December31, 2003. The Company has a Shareholder Rights Plan, under which the
Companys Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one-half of a Right for each share of Company common stock owned
at the inception of the Plan. The Plan provides, under certain
conditions involving acquisition of the Companys common
stock, that holders of Rights, except for the acquiring entity,
would be entitled ito purchase shares of preferred stock
at a specified exercise price, or iito purchase shares
of common stock of the Company, or the acquiring company, having
a value of twice the Rights exercise price. The Rights under the
Plan expire in 2007.   
9.
Stock Option and Award Plans The Companys 2002 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant
of up to 40million shares of common stock to eligible
employees and non-employee directors of the Company in the form
of options, phantom stock awards, restricted stock awards and
stock rights. The Companys 1999 Stock Incentive Plan
permits the grant of up to 40million shares of common
stock in the same form as those under the 2002 Plan. The
Companys 1997 Stock Incentive Plan permits the grant of up
to 76million shares of common stock in the same form as
those under the 2002 Plan. Stock options may be granted as
non-qualified stock options or as incentive stock options. Beginning in 2004, the Company adopted a change in its long-term
incentive compensation program for officers and other senior
managers to grant approximately 50% of the value of its
long-term incentive awards as restricted stock and 50% as stock
options, rather than primarily stock options as it had
previously. Restricted awards of the Companys common stock
are made to eligible employees and non-employee directors at
such cost to the grantee as the stock option committee of the
Board of Directors may determine. Such shares are granted
subject to certain conditions with respect to transfer and other
restrictions as prescribed by the plan. Upon grant of restricted
stock, unearned compensation, equivalent to the excess of the
market price of the shares awarded over the price paid by the
grantee at the date of grant, is charged as a reduction of
capital in excess of par value in the Companys
consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense over the
periods until the restrictions lapse. In 2004,
367,625shares of restricted stock were granted at an
average market value of $2796per restricted share.
Compensation expense related to restricted stock amortization
was $11million, $24million, and $06million
in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Restricted stock
compensation expense in 2003 included $21million in
connection with the acceleration of vesting of a restricted
stock grant. There were 364,945shares of restricted stock
outstanding at December31, 2004. No restricted stock
awards were granted in 2003 and 2002. Under the terms of the
existing Stock Incentive Plans, at December31, 2004,
349,807 additional shares of restricted stock may be granted. In 2004, the Company reserved 16,793shares of common
stock, and there were reductions for retirements and
terminations which totaled 15,410shares, under a
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP,
bringing the total number of shares reserved to
173,863shares of common stock as of December31,
2004. Charges to expense under the SERP, not significant in
amount, are considered pension expense see Note12, with
the offsetting credit reflected in capital in excess of par
value. 44 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued At December31, 2004, 6,919,840 8,615,898 in 2003 shares
of common stock were reserved for issuance, including stock
options outstanding, under the 2002, 1999 and 1997 plans. The
options are exercisable at prices not less than market prices on
dates of grant, and in installments over four- to ten-year
periods from dates of grant. Options vest on a straight-line
basis generally over a four-year period. The Company had no
stock appreciation rights outstanding at December31, 2004
or 2003. Stock appreciation rights, if and when issued, are
exercisable for cash and/or shares of the Companys common
stock when the related option is exercised. A charge to income
would be made for these rights and the related options. A summary of the Companys stock option activity and

The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, in accounting for its stock option awards,
which recognizes expense based on the intrinsic value of the
award at the date of grant. Since stock options have been issued
with the exercise price per share equal to the fair market value
per share at the date of grant, no compensation expense has
resulted related to these types of awards. Had the Company
accounted for stock awards in accordance with the fair value
method 45 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

thereafter. Rental expense was $113million in 2004 90million in 2003 and $85million in 2002. The
leases expire over a range of years from 2005 to 2031, with
renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and
conditions, contained in most of the leases. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had
$755million and $625million, respectively, in
purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of
contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed
prices. 46 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

At December31, 2004, the Company has deferred tax assets
totaling $64million related to foreign tax credits
$24million, and net operating loss carryforwards
$40million primarily related to the businesses acquired
in 2004. These deferred tax assets are offset by a 100%
valuation allowance. There were no valuation allowances against
deferred tax assets at December31, 2003. 47 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

In 2004, U.S.deferred income taxes totaling
$16million were provided on undistributed earnings of
certain non-U.S.subsidiaries that are not expected to be
permanently reinvested in such companies. There has been no
provision for U.S.deferred income taxes for the
undistributed earnings of certain other subsidiaries, which
total approximately $235million at December31,
2004, because the Company intends to reinvest these earnings
indefinitely in operations outside the United States. Upon
distribution of those earnings to the United States, the Company
would be subject to U.S.income taxes based on the excess
of the U.S.statutory rate over statutory rates in the
foreign jurisdiction and withholding taxes payable to the
various foreign countries. Determination of the amount of the
unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these
undistributed earnings is not practicable. As of December31, 2004, the Company has net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $127million for tax
purposes, which were primarily related to recent acquisitions.
The net operating loss carryforwards will be available to offset
future taxable income. If not used, these carryforwards will
expire between 2005 and 2018. The Company maintains a 100%
valuation allowance to offset the deferred tax assets resulting
from these benefits based on the likelihood of realization. Any
reductions in the valuation allowance resulting from the
realization of the loss carryforwards of acquired companies will
result in a reduction of the acquired goodwill. On October22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act
AJCA was signed into law. The AJCA includes a
deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the AJCA. The Company may elect to
apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in
2005. The Company has started an evaluation of the effects of
the repatriation provision of AJCA; however, the Company is
unable to complete this evaluation until Congress or the
Treasury Department provide additional clarifying language on
key elements of the provision. The Company expects to complete
its evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision
within a reasonable period of time following the publication of
the additional clarifying language. The range of possible
amounts that the Company is reviewing for possible repatriation
under this provision is between zero and $235million see
above discussion of undistributed earnings. The related
potential range of income tax liability is between zero and
$09million. Beginning in 2005, the AJCA provides for a
deduction for a portion of income attributable to
U.S.production activities. In addition, there is a
phased-in elimination of the tax benefit related to qualified
export sales. The Company is in the process of determining the
potential tax effect that could result from these aspects of the
new tax law.   
12.
Retirement Plans and Other Post Retirement Benefits Retirement and Pension Plans The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans
covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans
generally provide benefits based on participants years of
service and/or compensation. The following is a brief
description of the Companys retirement and pension plans. 48 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company maintains contributory and noncontributory defined
benefit pension plans. As a result of the acquisition of United
Kingdom based Airtechnology in 2003 and Taylor Hobson in 2004,
the Company obtained two foreign defined benefit pension plans,
which are similar to the Companys U.S.defined
benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly
employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through
trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The
Companys funding policy with respect to its defined
benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits
based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements
of U.S.federal and local foreign laws. Based on current
economic conditions, AMETEK estimates that it will make cash
contributions of approximately $6million to its
worldwide-defined benefit pension plans in 2005. The Company uses a measurement date of December31 for its
U.S.defined benefit pension plans and an October1,
measurement date for its foreign defined benefit pension plans. The Company sponsors a 401k retirement and savings plan for
eligible employees. Participants in the savings plan may
contribute a portion of their compensation on a before-tax
basis. The Company matches employee contributions on a
dollar-for-dollar basis up to 6% of eligible compensation or a
maximum of $1,200per participant. The Companys retirement and savings plan has a defined
contribution retirement feature principally to cover
U.S.salaried employees joining the Company after
December31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the
Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a
pre-established percentage of the covered employees
salary. Employees of certain of the Companys foreign
operations participate in various local defined contribution
plans. The Company also has a defined contribution retirement plan for
certain of its U.S.acquired businesses for the benefit of
eligible employees. Company contributions are made for each
participant up to a specified percentage, not to exceed 6% of
the participants base compensation. The Company has nonqualified unfunded retirement plans for its
Directors and certain retired employees. It also provides
supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual
arrangements and/or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
SERPcovering certain current and former executives of
the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to
compensate the employee for retirement benefits that would have
been provided under the Companys primary retirement plan,
except for statutory limitations on compensation that may be
taken into account under those plans. The projected benefit
obligations of the SERP and the contracts will primarily be
funded by a grant of shares of the Companys common stock
upon retirement or termination of the executives. The Company is
providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the
applicable periods. The following tables set forth the changes in benefit
obligations and the fair value of plan assets for the funded and

Amounts in 2004 and 2003 include an approximate 9% investment in
alternative assets consisting of diversified hedge funds of
funds. Amounts in 2004 and 2003 also include cash and cash
equivalents. 50 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The fair value of plan assets for these plans was
$3415million and $3182million at December31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The expected long-term rate of
return on these plan assets was 890% in 2004 and 2003. Equity
securities included 662,800shares of AMETEK, Inc. common
stock in the amount of $236million 69% of total plan
investment assets and 1,142,800shares in the amount of
$276million 87% of total plan investment assets at
December31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The objectives of the AMETEK, Inc. U.S.defined benefit
plans investment strategy are to maximize the Plans
funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan
expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long
term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been
established. Since there may be periods of time where both
equity and fixed income markets provide poor returns, an
allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the
overall portfolios diversification and return potential.
The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation taking
into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment
streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The
actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the
established targets and ranges, and rebalanced when necessary. The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and
style. The equity portfolio also includes an international
component. The objective of the fixed income portion of the pension assets
is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the
assets and to provide diversification. The fixed-income
portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity
guidelines in an attempt to minimize the adverse effects of
interest rate fluctuations. Other than for investments in alternative assets, which is
described in note aon page50, certain investments
are prohibited. Prohibited investments include venture capital,
private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin
trading, commodities, limited partnerships, short selling, and
rights and warrants. Swaps, options, forwards and futures may be
used to avoid market exposure, and to manage foreign currency
exposure. 51 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Primarily cash and cash equivalents. The objectives of AMETEK, Inc.s foreign defined benefit
plans investment strategy is to maximize the long-term
rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable
level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular
basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an
objective to balance risks against the current and future needs
of the Plan. The trustees consider the risk associated with the
different asset classes, relative to the Plans liabilities
and how this can be affected by diversification, relative
returns available on equities, fixed income investments, real
estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns
and the cash flow requirements of the Plans are
considered. It is expected that equities will outperform fixed
interest investments over the long term. However, the trustees
recognize the fact that fixed income investments may better
match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively
young active employee group covered by the plans, and the
immature nature of the plans, the Trustees have chosen to adopt
an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity
investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed
from time to time in view of changes in market conditions and in
the Plans liability profile. 52 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was
developed based on a review of historical investment returns for
the investment categories for the defined benefit pension
assets. This review also considered current capital market
conditions and expectations of projected future investment
returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset
category are lower than the actual long-term historical returns.
The current low interest rate environment also influences this
outlook. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for
U.S.Plans is being reduced from 890% in 2004 to 85% for
2005. The expected return on assets for the foreign plans for
2005 remains unchanged from 2004 at 72%. 54 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Postretirement Plans and Postemployment Benefits The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than
pensions for certain retirees and a small number of current and
former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not
funded and are not significant. In connection with the flood
loss and closure of the plant described in Note6, in the
fourth quarter of 2004, the Company accelerated the recognition
of deferred actuarial losses under the affected postretirement
benefit plan resulting in a $10million pre-tax charge
against earnings. The Company also provides limited postemployment benefits for
certain former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount. The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows
employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for
retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus
compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed
invested in either, or a combination of, aan
interest-bearing account, benefits from which are payable out of
the general assets of the Company, or bthe equivalent of
a fund which invests in shares of the Companys common
stock on behalf of the employee. The amount deferred under the
plan, including income earned, was $54million and
$43million at December31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Administrative expense for the plan is borne by
the Company and is not significant.   
13.
Financial Instruments As discussed in Note1, the Company makes limited use of
derivative financial instruments, and does not use them for
trading purposes. Interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to reduce the
potential impact of increases in interest rates on the
Companys borrowings. Accordingly, the Company may enter
into these agreements to effectively convert floating-rate loans
to fixed-rate loans and to cap certain interest rates that are
indexed to LIBOR rates to reduce the risk from rising interest
rates. During 2004 and 2003, the Company was not party to such
agreements. Qualifying derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments
are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item
is an investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December31,
2004 and 2003, the Company had $1727million and
$893million, respectively, of British pound denominated
loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net
investment in foreign subsidiaries acquired in 2004 and 2003. As
a result, approximately $101million and $94million
of currency losses have been included in the translation
adjustment in other comprehensive income during 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Forward currency contracts may be utilized from time to time to
hedge certain firm inventory purchases and export sales
commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of
such hedging activities is to protect the Company from the risk
that the eventual net cash dollar outflows and inflows resulting
from the purchase of certain inventories or the sales to foreign
customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange
rates. The terms of the currency contracts are dependent on the
firm commitment. During 2004, and 55 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued 2003, the Company was party to one forward contract for the
purchase of certain inventories in connection with one of its
2003 acquisitions. The amounts involved are not material to the
Company. The estimated fair values of the Companys financial
instruments are compared below to the recorded amounts at
December31, 2004 and 2003. Cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities are recorded at fair value at

Business Segment and Geographic Information Descriptive Information About Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments, the Electronic
Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group. The Company
manages, evaluates and aggregates its operating segments for
segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product
type, production processes, distribution methods, and management
organizations. The Electronic Instruments Group produces instrumentation for
various electronic applications used in types of transportation
industries, including aircraft cockpit instruments and displays,
airborne electronics systems that monitor and record flight and
engine data, and pressure, temperature, flow and liquid-level
sensors for commercial airlines and aircraft and jet engine
manufacturers. The Group also produces analytical
instrumentation for the laboratory and research markets, as well
as instruments for food service equipment, measurement and
monitoring instrumentation for various process industries and
instruments and complete instrument panels for heavy truck
manufacturers and heavy construction and agricultural vehicles.
The Group also manufactures ultraprecise measurement
instrumentation, and thermoplastic compounds for automotive,
appliance, and telecommunications applications. The Electromechanical Group produces air-moving electric motors
and motor-blower systems for manufacturers of floor care
appliances and outdoor power equipment, and fractional
horsepower and brushless air-moving motors for aerospace, mass
transit, medical equipment, computer and business machine
applications. The Group also produces high-purity metal powders
and alloys in powder, strip, and wire form for electronic
components, aircraft and automotive products, as well as heat
exchangers and thermal management subsystems. Sales of electric
motors, blowers, and fans represented 393% in 2004, 422% in
2003, and 417% in 2002 of the Companys consolidated net
sales. Measurement of Segment Results Segment operating income represents sales, less all direct costs
and expenses including certain administrative and other
expenses applicable to each segment, but does not include an
allocation of interest expense. Net sales by segment are
reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales,
which are insignificant in amount. Such sales are generally
based on prevailing market prices. Reported segment assets
include allocations directly related to the segments
operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of investments,
insurance deposits, and deferred taxes. 57 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Guarantees The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine
basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters
of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its
business to provide financial or performance assurance to third
parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or
enhance the subsidiarys stand-alone creditworthiness. The
amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on
the covered contracts actually outstanding at any particular
point in time. The maximum amount of future payment obligations
relative to these various guarantees was approximately
$562million, and the outstanding liability under certain
of those guarantees was approximately $78million at
December31, 2004. These guarantees expire in 2005 and 2006. Indemnifications In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture
transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to
compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future
unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified
events e.g., breaches of contract obligations, or retention of
previously existing 60 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued environmental, tax or employee liabilities whose terms range in
duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where
appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is
recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of
indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the
overall maximum amount of the obligation under such
indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the
Company indemnifies its directors and officers who are or were
serving at the Companys request in such capacities.
Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related
to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The
Company believes that future payments, if any, under all
existing indemnification agreements would not have a material
impact on its results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows. Product Warranties The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the
sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold
vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the
most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its
warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and
adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty
expenses. Changes in the Companys accrued product warranty
obligation for the years ended December31, 2004 and 2003
were as follows in thousands

Contingencies Asbestos Litigation The Company and/or its subsidiaries have been named as
defendants, along with many other companies, in a number of
asbestos-related lawsuits. To date, no judgments have been made
against the Company. The Company believes it has strong defenses
to the claims, and intends to continue to defend itself
vigorously in these matters. Other companies are also
indemnifying the Company against certain of these claims. Environmental Matters Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have
resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as
defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these
waste products were handled in compliance with regulations
existing at that time, the Company has been named a Potentially
Responsible Party PRPregarding waste remediation at
several non-AMETEK sites that are the subject of
government-mandated cleanups. In addition to these non-AMETEK
sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves
for probable remediation activities at certain of its
manufacturing locations and for claims and proceedings against
the Company with respect to other environmental matters once the
Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable.
Total environmental reserves at December31, 2004 and 2003
were approximately $73million and $64million,
respectively. In 2004, the Company spent approximately
$10million on such environmental matters, compared with
approximately $11million in 2003. 61 AMETEK, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTSContinued The Company also has agreements with former owners of certain of
its acquired businesses as well as new owners of previously
owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements the former or
new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the
Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities
under certain circumstances. The Company and some of the other
parties carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters.
To date, those parties have met their obligations in all
material respects. The Company has no reason to believe that
such third parties would fail to perform their obligations in
the future. However, if the Company were required to record a
liability with respect to all, or a portion of, such matters on
its balance sheet, the effect on income and the amount of the
liability would not be significant. In the opinion of
management, based upon presently available information and past
experience related to such matters, either adequate provision
for probable costs has been made, or the ultimate cost resulting
from these actions is not expected to materially affect the
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows of the Company. 62
