Net of underwriting fees and offering expenses, proceeds to the Company
aggregated $317 million. On July 31, 1996, the Company completed a third public
offering consisting of 2,541,595 shares of its common stock at $2500 per share.
Net of underwriting fees and offering expenses, proceeds to the Company
aggregated $598 million. 2} SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
FISCAL YEAR - The Company maintains its accounts on a 52/53 week fiscal year
ending the last Sunday in October. The fiscal years ended October 27, 1996
fiscal 1996, October 29, 1995 fiscal 1995 and October 30, 1994 fiscal 1994
each contained 52 weeks.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Quality Dining, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for using the equity
method.
-31 
USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
INVENTORIES - Inventories consist primarily of restaurant food and supplies and
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-
in, first-out method.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment, including capitalized leased
properties, are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are being recorded
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets, which range from three to 31 1/2 years, or the terms of the related
leases, if shorter. Upon the sale or disposition of property and equipment, the
asset cost and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and
any resulting gain or loss is included in income. Normal repairs and maintenance
costs are expensed as incurred.
GOODWILL AND TRADEMARKS - Goodwill arising from the excess of the purchase price
over the acquired tangible and intangible net assets acquired in acquisitions
and trademarks are being amortized on a straight-line basis, principally over 40
years. Accumulated amortization of goodwill as of October 27, 1996 and October
29, 1995 was $2,455,801 and $546,835, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
trademarks as of October 27, 1996 was $281,287 none at October 29, 1995. The
Company reviews the carrying value of these recorded assets whenever events or
changes in circumstances warrant, and measures the potential impairment by
comparing the carrying value of the asset to the expected undiscounted net
future cash inflows resulting from the assets to which the intangible relates.
Management believes that no impairment of goodwill and trademarks has occurred
and that no reduction of the estimated useful life is warranted.
FRANCHISE FEES AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS - The Company Burger King and Chili
franchise agreements require the payment of a franchise fee for each restaurant
opened. Franchise fees are deferred and amortized on the straight-line method
over the lives of the respective franchise agreements. Development costs paid to
the respective franchisors are deferred and expensed in the period the related
restaurants are opened. The excess of the purchase price over the acquired
tangible and intangible assets acquired in the SHONCO acquisition has been
allocated to franchise rights see Note 14. The franchise agreements generally
provide for a term of 20 years with renewal options upon expiration. Accumulated
amortization of franchise fees and development costs as of October 27, 1996 and
October 29, 1995 was $1,702,510 and $1,050,572, respectively.
FRANCHISE RELATED REVENUE RECOGNITION - Franchise related revenue includes
royalties, franchise fees, development fees, net commissary revenue, interest
income and other miscellaneous fees related to the Company bagel business.
Franchisees are required to pay monthly royalties, generally 4% to 5% of
restaurant sales, which the Company recognizes as earned. Each franchisee also
pays an initial franchise fee for each bakery opened. Development fees, which
result from area development agreements with franchisees, are deferred and
recognized as revenue when all material conditions have been substantially
completed by the Company, which generally occurs when the bakeries under the
related area development agreements are opened. Deferred development fees at
October 27, 1996 were $770,000. Net commissary revenue results from products
sold to franchisees from Company-owned commissaries. Interest income results
from the Company notes receivable from franchisees.
ADVERTISING - The Company maintains an advertising fund for national and
regional advertising for the Bruegger Bagel Bakery Bruegger concept. The
advertising fund collects fees paid by Company-owned 
-32 
and franchised bakeries, and disburses funds relating to costs associated with
maintaining, administering and preparing advertising, marketing, public
relations and promotional programs for the Bruegger concept. Contributions to
the fund are based on a specified percentage of sales, generally 2% to 4%. Such
contributions are recorded as earned and have been reflected as a reduction of
advertising expenses in the 1996 consolidated statement of income. The Company
incurs advertising expense related to its other concepts under franchise
agreements see Note 5 or through local advertising. Advertising costs are
expensed at the time the related advertising first takes place. Advertising
costs for all concepts were $46 million, $29 million and $28 million for
fiscal years 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
PRE-OPENING COSTS - Direct costs incurred in connection with opening new
restaurants are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month
period following the opening of a restaurant. Amortization of pre-opening costs
aggregated $1,848,021, $1,007,320 and $248,264 for fiscal years 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.
LIQUOR LICENSES - Costs incurred in securing liquor licenses for the Company
restaurants and the fair value of liquor licenses acquired in acquisitions are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis, principally over 20 years.
Accumulated amortization of liquor licenses as of October 27, 1996 and October
29, 1995 was $269,752 and $146,157, respectively.
COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS - Costs of purchased and internally developed computer
software are capitalized and amortized over a five-year period using the
straight-line method. As of October 27, 1996 and October 29, 1995, capitalized
computer software costs, net of related accumulated amortization, aggregated
$1,707,512 and $406,957, respectively. Amortization of computer software costs
was $197,472 for fiscal year 1996. Amortization of computer software costs in
fiscal 1995 and 1994 was not significant.
CAPITALIZED INTEREST - Interest costs capitalized during the construction period
of new restaurants were $233,837 and $137,545 for fiscal years 1996 and 1995,
respectively. No interest was capitalized in fiscal 1994.
INCOME TAXES - In connection with the reorganization on March 1, 1994, the
Company terminated its S Corporation status and became taxable as a C
Corporation. On that date, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the
financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in
effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Upon
termination of the Company S Corporation status and adoption of SFAS No. 109,
the Company established a net deferred tax liability of $546,000 representing
the tax effect of cumulative temporary differences as of that date see Note 7.
The consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended October
27, 1996 and October 29, 1995 include a provision for income taxes for the
entire period. Prior to March 1, 1994, the Company or its predecessors had
elected to be taxed under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result
of the election, federal and state income taxes on the net income of the Company
were payable personally by the stockholders. The consolidated statement of
income for the fiscal year ended October 30, 1994 includes a provision for
federal and state income taxes only for the period March 1, 1994 through October
30, 1994. Accordingly, a pro forma provision for federal and state income taxes,
using a 37% effective rate, is presented for the period November 1, 1993 through
February 28, 1994 as if the Company were taxed as a C Corporation for the entire
fiscal year.
-33 
CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments, which potentially subject
the Company to credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and
notes receivable see Notes 13 and 14. Substantially all of the Company cash
and cash equivalents at October 27, 1996 are concentrated with a bank located in
Michigan City, Indiana.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS - For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash
flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
PRO FORMA DATA UNAUDITED - Pro forma net income per share for the fiscal year
ended October 30, 1994 is based on 4,437,552 shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding from November 1, 1993 to March 1, 1994, which
includes 4,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, including shares issued
in the exchange of shares discussed in Note 1, and 437,552 shares of common
stock and common stock equivalents assumed to be outstanding, and 6,471,250
shares of common stock outstanding from that date through October 30, 1994.
The 437,552 shares of common stock and common stock equivalents assumed to
be outstanding are equivalent to the number of shares of common stock at the
initial public offering price of $1150 per share after deducting underwriting
discounts necessary to fund that portion of the $51 million S Corporation and
special distributions payable to stockholders in excess of fiscal 1993
undistributed earnings in the aggregate amount of $44 million at October 31,
1993 and 26,359 common stock equivalents assumed outstanding resulting from the
granting of nonqualified stock options to certain employees of the Company to
purchase an aggregate of 26,590 shares of the Company common stock.
RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain information in the consolidated financial statements
for fiscal 1995 and 1994 has been reclassified to conform with the current
reporting format. The reclassifications had no effect on total assets,
liabilities and stockholders' equity or net income as previously reported.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS - In March 1995, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This statement
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the impairment of
long-lived assets, certain identifiable intangibles, and goodwill related to
those assets to be held and used, and for long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of. This statement is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The Company does not expect
that the adoption of SFAS No. 121 in fiscal 1997 will have a material effect on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations.
In October 1995, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation. This statement establishes a fair value based method of
accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments, but allows
companies to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the
intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles
Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Companies electing to continue to apply the accounting requirements in APB
Opinion No. 25 must, however, make pro forma disclosures of net income and net
income per share as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS
No. 123 had been applied. These disclosure requirements are effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995. The Company expects to adopt
SFAS No. 123 on a disclosure basis only, beginning in fiscal 1997.

-  5} FRANCHISE AND DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
The Company has entered into franchise agreements with two franchisors for
the operation of two of its restaurant concepts, Burger King and Chili. The
franchise agreements provide the franchisors with significant rights regarding
the business and operations of the Company franchised restaurants. The
franchise agreements with Burger King Corporation require the Company to pay
royalty and advertising fees equal to 35% and 40% of Burger King restaurant
sales, respectively. The franchise agreements with Brinker International, Inc.
-35 
Brinker covering the Company Chili restaurant concept require the
Company to pay royalty and advertising fees equal to 40% and 05% of Chili
restaurant sales, respectively.
The Company has entered into development agreements to develop additional
restaurants in each of the two concepts. Each of the development agreements
requires the Company to pay a development fee. In addition, the development
agreements contain certain requirements regarding the number of units to be
opened in the future. Each restaurant opened will be subject to a separate
franchise agreement, which requires the payment of an initial franchise fee
currently $40,000 for each such restaurant. Should the Company fail to comply
with the required development schedules or with the requirements of the
agreements for restaurants within areas covered by the development agreements,
the franchisors have the right to terminate the Company development agreements
and the exclusivity provided by the development agreements.
The Company Bruegger Bagel Bakeries and Spageddies restaurant concepts
were previously subject to franchise and development agreements with Bruegger
Corporation and Brinker, respectively. These agreements required the payment of
royalty and advertising fees and an initial franchise fee upon opening a
restaurant. On June 7, 1996, the Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of Bruegger Corporation and is no longer
subject to such fees. On October 28, 1995, the Company acquired all rights to
the Spageddies restaurant concept in the United States from Brinker for a cash
payment of $100,000 and is no longer subject to such fees. 6} RETIREMENT PLANS
The Company maintains a discretionary, noncontributory profit sharing plan
for its eligible employees. Plan contributions are determined by the Company
Board of Directors and are based upon 57% of annual participant compensation in
excess of the social security wage base. Contributions in excess of that
amount, if any, are allocated to all plan participants on a pro-rata basis.
All employees are also eligible to participate in a 401k plan after one
year of service in which the employee has worked a minimum of 1,000 hours. The
Company matches a portion of the employee contribution to the plan and
provides investment choices for the employee.
The Company contributions under both plans aggregated $100,000, $70,000
and $60,000 for fiscal years 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. 7} INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended October 27, 1996,
October 29, 1995 and for the period March 1, 1994 through October 30, 1994 see

-  Effective with the acquisition of Bruegger Corporation on June 7, 1996, the
Company established a valuation allowance against Bruegger Corporation
deferred tax assets in the amount of $48 million. Subsequent to the acquisition
date, the Company reduced the valuation allowance by $680,000 with a
corresponding reduction of goodwill. Any future reductions in the valuation
allowance will also reduce goodwill. Net operating losses of Bruegger
Corporation in the amount of $94 million expire through the year 2011 and are
subject to limitations as to their utilization.

As an S Corporation, the Company or its predecessors made annual
S Corporation distributions to its stockholders. On February 28, 1994, the
Company distributed to its stockholders its S Corporation earnings from November
1, 1993 through that date in the aggregate amount of $14 million. On December
17, 1993, the Company and its predecessors declared distributions to their
respective stockholders aggregating $51 million
-37 
that were paid on January 4, 1994. Of the total distributions, an amount
representing undistributed S Corporation earnings through October 31, 1993 $27
million was paid in cash and a special distribution of $24 million was
represented by two-year promissory notes bearing interest at the rate of 6% per
annum. The promissory notes were repaid in full from the proceeds of the
Company initial public offering. 9} LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS
On April 26, 1996, the Company amended its revolving credit agreement
providing for borrowings up to $150 million. The interest rate paid by the
Company is the adjusted LIBOR rate plus 15% 69375% at October 27, 1996.
Concurrently, the Company repaid the amount then outstanding under the previous
revolving loan agreement, which was terminated.
The revolving credit agreement expires on April 26, 1999 and is unsecured.
The revolving credit agreement contains, among other provisions, certain
restrictive covenants including maintenance of certain prescribed debt and fixed
charge coverage ratios, minimum levels of tangible net worth, as defined,
limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and annual limitations
on the payment of dividends other than stock dividends on, or the purchase or
redemption of, any shares of the Company capital stock in aggregate amounts
exceeding 40% of the Company net income for the immediately preceding fiscal
year. As of October 27, 1996, there was $786 million outstanding under this
revolving credit agreement.
In connection with the Grady American Grill acquisition see Note 14,
the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement providing for borrowings
of up to $85 million with interest payable monthly at the lower of the adjusted
LIBOR rate plus 2% or the bank prime rate less 05%. On December 21, 1995, the
Company borrowed $82 million under this agreement to finance the Grady
American Grill acquisition and to repay the amount then outstanding under the
previous revolving credit agreement, which was terminated.
On February 22, 1994, the Company entered into a revolving credit
agreement, which as amended through August 10, 1995, provided for borrowings up
to a maximum of $45 million with interest payable monthly at the lower of the
LIBOR rate plus 2% or the bank prime rate less 05%. As of October 29, 1995,
there was $74 million outstanding under this revolving credit agreement. 10} STOCK OPTION PLANS
The Company has two stock option plans: the 1993 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan the Employee Plan and the Outside Directors Stock Option Plan
the Outside Directors Plan.
Under the Employee Plan, shares of restricted stock and options to purchase
shares of the Company common stock may be granted to officers and other
employees. An aggregate of one million shares of common stock, including an
additional 500,000 shares reserved in fiscal 1996, have been reserved for
issuance under the Employee Plan. On December 17, 1993, the Company Board of
Directors granted nonqualified stock options for 770 employees to purchase an
aggregate of 26,590 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $10 per
share. The options have a term of 10 years and were exercisable beginning
February 1, 1995. Compensation expense of approximately $300,000 associated with
the granting of these nonqualified stock options was recognized at the date of
the Company initial public offering March 8, 1994. Since that date, certain
of these employees terminated their employment with the Company prior to
exercising the options. As a result, the amount of compensation expense was
reduced to $212,838 for fiscal year 1994 and was further reduced by $37,883 and
$6,739 during fiscal years 1995 and 1996, respectively. These amounts are
included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements
of income.
Under the Outside Directors Plan, 40,000 shares of common stock have been
reserved for the issuance of nonqualified stock options to be granted to non-
employee directors of the Company. On May 1, 1994 and on each May 1 thereafter,
each then non-employee director of the Company will receive an option to
purchase 
-38 
2,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of the Company common stock on the date of grant. Each option has
a term of 10 years and becomes exercisable six months after the date of grant.
Activity with respect to the Company stock option plans for fiscal years
1996, 1995 and 1994 was as follows  
Number of Shares Price Range

respectively. 12} COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is party to several legal proceedings which are considered by
management to be customary and incidental to its business. In the opinion of
management, after consulting with legal counsel, the ultimate disposition of
these lawsuits should not have a material adverse effect on the Company
consolidated financial position or results of operations.
The Company is self-insured for the portion of its employee health care
costs not covered by insurance. The Company is liable for medical claims up to
$100,000 per eligible employee annually, and aggregate annual claims up to
approximately $22 million. The aggregate annual deductible is determined by
the number of eligible covered employees during the year and the coverage they
elect.
The Company is self-insured with respect to any worker compensation
claims not covered by insurance. The Company maintains a $250,000 annual
deductible per occurrence and is liable for aggregate annual claims up to
approximately $600,000.
During fiscal 1996, the Company invested $718,750 for a 50% ownership
interest in a limited liability company LLC established to acquire and
develop a 53,000 square-foot facility, which the Company intends to occupy in
1997 as its corporate headquarters and lease from the LLC. The investment is
accounted for using the equity method. The related lease agreement provides for
a fifteen-year initial term, with four additional five-year renewal options.
Minimum annual rental payments are estimated to be approximately $600,000 and
have not been included in the future minimum lease payments summarized in Note
11. The Company is responsible for costs incurred on the headquarters facility
in excess of those originally planned. The Company and the other member of the
LLC have jointly and severally guaranteed the debt of the LLC, which amounted to
$40 million at October 27, 1996.
At October 27, 1996, the Company had commitments aggregating $13 million
for the construction of restaurants.

to terminate a lease for office space located in Vermont. The agreement requires
a payment of $900,000 to be made in the first quarter of fiscal 1997. The
estimated cost for the termination of this lease was accrued as part of the cost
of the purchase of Bruegger Corporation at the time of the acquisition see
Note 14.
Affiliated real estate partnerships and two other entities related through
common ownership pay management fees to the Company as reimbursement for
administrative services provided. Total management fees for fiscal 1996, 1995

certain of the Company restaurants. As of November 1, 1995, the Company
acquired all of the capital stock of this related-party construction company.
During fiscal 1996, the Company loaned $99 million to a company owned by a
director and officer of the Company, which used the funds to acquire a number of
Bruegger Bagel Bakeries from independent franchisees. The $99 million
promissory note bears interest at 11%, is due April 15, 1997 and is
collateralized by substantially all assets of the related company. Interest
income recognized by the Company on this note in fiscal 1996 amounted to
$119,000. Subsequent to October 27, 1996 and through January 10, 1997, the
-41 
Company loaned this related company an additional $145 million to acquire
additional Bruegger Bagel Bakeries from independent franchisees and for
working capital purposes. The Company anticipates that all of these bakeries
will be sold to other unrelated franchisees of Bruegger in fiscal 1997.
The Company and its Bruegger concept transact certain business activities

On July 15, 1996, the Company acquired all the assets, including
trademarks, of Moe Broadway Bagel, Inc., operator of three Moe Broadway
Bagel restaurants Moe, for $36 million in cash. In a concurrent
transaction, the Company sold the operating assets of Moe to a third party in
exchange for a promissory note in the amount of $35 million and entered into
development and franchise agreements for which the Company collects franchise
related revenues. The promissory note bears interest at 11%, is due April 15,
1997 and is collateralized by substantially all assets of Moe. The Company
retained the rights to all of Moe trademarks and other intangible assets.
On June 7, 1996, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock of Bruegger Corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the
acquisition and related merger agreement, Bruegger Corporation became a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of the issuance of
5,127,121 shares of the Company common stock, valued at $1231 million, and
direct acquisition and estimated post-merger integration costs aggregating $69
million. The Company also issued 117,800 shares of its Series A Convertible
Cumulative Preferred Stock, without par value the Quality Dining Preferred
Stock in exchange for a like number of issued and outstanding shares
exclusive of those shares held by the Company, which were canceled of
Bruegger Corporation Class A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $100 par
value per share. Subsequent to the acquisition, 101,150 shares of the Quality
Dining Preferred Stock were converted into an aggregate of 285,531 shares of the
Company common stock. The excess of the purchase price over the acquired
tangible and intangible net assets of $1439 million has been allocated to
goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded a special pre-tax
charge of $80 million for combining and integrating administrative functions,
recruiting and relocating new employees, franchise related costs, and legal and
professional fees. This charge was in addition to the $60 million recorded as
part of the cost of the acquisition for facility closures, restaurant remodeling
and relocation and severance packages for Bruegger personnel. Through fiscal
1996, approximately $49 million of these costs have been incurred, of which
$35 million were cash payments and $14 million were non-cash charges,
primarily for the write down of assets. The Company expects to complete these
actions in fiscal 1997.
On December 21, 1995, the Company acquired 42 Grady American Grill
restaurants and all rights to the Grady American Grill concept from Brinker

through borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility. The excess of
the purchase price over the acquired tangible and intangible net assets of $132
million has been allocated to trademarks and is being amortized on a straight-
line basis over 40 years.                   -42 
The acquisitions of Bruegger Corporation and Grady American Grill were
both accounted for using the purchase method and the operating results have been
included in the Company consolidated financial statements since their
respective acquisition dates.
In connection with the acquisitions of Grady American Grill and the
rights to the Spageddies restaurant concept in the United States, which was
finalized on October 28, 1995, the Company recorded a special pre-tax charge of
$19 million during the first quarter of fiscal 1996. The charge reflected the
estimated costs for integration of computer systems, employee transition costs,
recruitment and relocation costs, and legal and professional fees. At October
27, 1996, substantially all costs related to these activities had been incurred.
On August 14, 1995, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
common stock of SHONCO, Inc. and three affiliated companies and certain
operating assets of three other affiliated companies. SHONCO, Inc. and its
affiliated companies collectively, SHONCO owned and operated eight Burger
King restaurants in the Detroit, Michigan metropolitan area, and had the right
to develop four additional Burger King restaurants in that metropolitan area
under target reservation agreements acquired by the Company. The purchase price
of SHONCO aggregated $96 million and consisted of $51 million in cash
including $450,000 paid in fiscal 1996, the issuance of 316,832 shares of the
Company common stock, valued at $40 million, and the incurrence of a $510,000
liability under a non-competition agreement discounted at 85%. The
acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and the operating
results of SHONCO have been included in the Company consolidated financial
statements since the date of the acquisition. A deferred tax liability of $14
million was established at the time of the acquisition for the income tax effect
of differences between the book and tax bases of certain of the assets acquired.
The excess of the purchase price over the acquired tangible and intangible net
assets of $77 million has been allocated to franchise rights and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
On November 10, 1994, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of Grayling Corporation and certain affiliated companies collectively,
Grayling, and certain real estate and improvements from an affiliate of the
principal Grayling stockholder. Grayling operated eight Chili restaurants in

aggregated $197 million consisting of $163 million in cash and the issuance of
286,080 shares of the Company common stock valued at $34 million. The Company
also paid $26 million in cash for the real estate and improvements related to a
Chili restaurant under construction held by an affiliate of the principal
Grayling stockholder. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded through
borrowings under the Company revolving credit facility.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and the
operating results of Grayling have been included in the Company consolidated
financial statements since the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase
price over the acquired tangible and intangible net assets of $106 million has
been allocated to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
20 years.
