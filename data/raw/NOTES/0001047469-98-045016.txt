REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
To the Stockholders of
Health Systems Design Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Health
Systems Design Corporation a Delaware corporation and subsidiary as of
September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended September 30, 1998. These consolidated financial statements and
the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Health Systems Design
Corporation and subsidiary as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended September 30, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in Item 14 of Form
10-K is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission rules and is not part of the basic financial statements. This
schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all
material respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. ORGANIZATION:
Health Systems Design Corp. was incorporated in the State of California on
July 1, 1988. In February 1996, the Company was reorganized as Health Systems
Design Corporation the Company, a Delaware holding corporation which owns
100% of the stock of Health System Design Corp., the California corporation. The
Company is a provider of managed care information systems software to payors and
providers of managed care services. The Company introduced its first internally
developed product, DIAMOND-TM- 725, in fiscal 1992 followed by DIAMOND-TM-
950C/S in fiscal 1995.
Substantially all of the Company operations are in one industry segment:
developing and selling managed care information systems. Therefore, no industry
segment information is presented.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The Consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Health Systems
Design Corporation and its subsidiary. All intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company considers cash and cash equivalents to be all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of less three months or less from the date
of purchase.
CONCENTRATION OF BUSINESS RISKS
The market for the Company products and services is characterized by
intense competition, rapid technological developments, frequent new product
introductions, and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, the Company is
required to continually improve the performance, features and reliability of its
products and develop and maintain strategic relationships with distributors and
with other service organizations. In addition, substantially all of the
Company revenue is derived from its two principal products.
The Company operates primarily in the United States, but has contracts in
other countries. These contracts could be impacted by particular economic and
political situations overseas.
See Note 8 for discussion of sales to major customers.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The Company believes
it has addressed this risk through its contract approval process.
ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
For the year ending September 30, 1999, the Company will report
Comprehensive Income based upon the recently issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130 SFAS No. 130, Comprehensive Income. The pro
forma effect of this accounting change has no impact on the net loss as reported
for the year ended September 30, 1998.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information, which is required to be adopted for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. The Statement changes the way
public companies report segment information in financial statements and also
requires those companies to report selected segment information in interim
financial reports to stockholders. Adoption of this pronouncement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company financial statements taken
as a whole.
In February 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 132, Employer Disclosures
about Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits, which is required to be
adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997. Adoption of this
pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Company
financial statements taken as a whole
In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities which is required to be adopted for fiscal
quarters beginning after June 15, 1999. Adoption of this pronouncement is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company financial statements taken
as a whole.
MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions. These assumptions effect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. Significant estimates made by management include: revenue recognition
under the percentage-of-completion method for its license contracts which
require extended installation periods, determination of technological
feasibility of software under development and related research and development
cost capitalization, product life amortization periods for capitalized software
costs, and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, and certain other
reserves, including a reserve required under the SMS amendment.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Company licenses its internally developed software products and other
software products to health care organizations under the terms of product
license contracts. Individual sales may include, among others, a combination of
software license, implementation, program enhancements, training, and support.
Contracts with customers could be terminated under certain circumstances and
revenues recognized could be refundable upon termination in certain cases,
including breach of contract. The termination of significant customer contracts
could have a material adverse effect on the Company business, financial
condition, or results of operations.
In October, 1997, the AICPA issued SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition,
which the Company was required to adopt as of October 1, 1999. SOP 97-2 provides
guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing
revenue on software transactions and supercedes the guidance contained in SOP
91-1. The Company elected to adopt the provisions of the statement effective
October 1, 1997.
The Company generates revenues from licensing the rights to use its software
products directly to end-users and indirectly through distributors. The Company
also generates revenues from sales of post-
29
HEALTH SYSTEMS DESIGN CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
contract support, implementation services, fees for product enhancements, and
training services performed for customers who license the Company products.
If the contract does not require significant production or customization of
software, revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are met: a
signed contract is obtained, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed and
determinable, and collection is probable. Effective October 1, 1997, the Company
generally recognizes DIAMOND-TM- 725 license revenue upon shipment of the
software to end users, as no significant production or customization of this
software is required, and the installation period is relatively short. The
Company generally recognizes DIAMOND-TM- 950C/S license revenue on a
percentage-of-completion basis based on the labor hours required to implement
the system, as this software generally requires an extended installation period
and can require significant enhancements. If the software license agreement
provides for acceptance criteria that extend beyond the published specifications
of the applicable product, then revenues are recognized upon the earlier of
customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period.
Implementation and training fees are billed either on an hourly or a monthly
basis and are recognized as services are rendered. Third party software and
hardware are typically billed and recognized as revenue when delivered to the
end user.
Post-contract support services are billed on a monthly basis. Customers who
purchase post-contract support services under maintenance agreements have the
right to receive unspecified product updates and upgrades. Customers that do not
purchase post-contract support must purchase product updates and upgrades under
separate agreements that are subject to the criteria of the Company revenue
recognition policy. Revenues from post-contract support services are recognized
ratably over the term of the support period. If post-contract support services
are included free or at a discount in a license agreement, such amounts are
recorded at their fair market value based on the value established by
independent sale of such post-contract support services to customers.
In January 1994, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with another
company remarketer, whereby the remarketer sells certain of the Company
products to its customer base. License fees under this agreement are recognized
when a contract between the other company and the end-user is executed for
DIAMOND-TM- 725 and are recognized for DIAMOND-TM- 950C/S upon successful
implementation of the system at the remarketer end-user site. Revenues under
term license agreements are recognized ratably over the customer contract
term. Fees for support and other services are recognized as services are
rendered. In December 1997, the Company entered into an amendment to the above
agreement for the purpose of resolving certain disagreements between the
parties, amongst other matters. The amendment provides for a $4 million credit
pool against which the remarketer may charge billings for services rendered by
the Company, as well as future royalties payable by the remarketer to license
the DIAMOND-TM- products. As of September 30, 1998, the credit pool had been
reduced to approximately $35 million. Due to the establishment of the credit
pool, the Company has not generated significant revenues from this remarketer
and is not expected to in the near future.
Revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as an asset unbilled
revenue. Billings in excess of recognized revenue are recorded as a liability
unearned revenue.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: CONTINUED
CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
The Company accounts for capitalized software development costs in
accordance with SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to
be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed. The Company begins capitalizing software
development costs upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is
established upon the completion of a working model or, in the case of major
releases, detailed program design. Costs incurred prior to technological
feasibility are charged to expense as incurred. Capitalization ceases when the
product is considered available for general release to customers. Capitalized
software development costs are amortized to direct costs over the estimated
economic lives of the software products based on actual sales experience and
product life expectancy. Generally, estimated economic lives of the software
products do not exceed 3 years. Capitalized software development cost
amortization was $345,000, $192,244 and $235,001 in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996,
respectively.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Computer equipment and office furniture are recorded at cost and are
depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of
three and seven years, respectively. The cost of assets retired or otherwise
disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts, and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations.
Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of assets are
expensed as incurred.
INCOME TAXES
The Company provides for income taxes under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, issued in
February 1992. Under the liability method specified by SFAS No. 109, deferred
income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial
statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the effective
tax rate. A valuation allowance is placed on the deferred tax assets to reduce
them to their net realizable value. The Company was on the cash basis of
accounting for tax reporting purposes during the fiscal years ended September
30, 1996 and 1995 and changed to the accrual basis of accounting as of October
1, 1996.
NET INCOME LOSS PER SHARE
During 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 128, Earnings per Share. Net
income loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
outstanding. Stock options and warrants are excluded from the computation as
their effect is antidilutive in fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996. The change in the
Company previously reported net income loss per share for fiscal 1996 is due
to the adoption of SFAS No. 128 and subsequently, Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
98 on Computations of Earnings per Share, which became effective in February
1998.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
During the fourth quarter Company management decided to revise its expense
classifications to be more consistent with industry standards. This decision
resulted in certain product engineering costs being included in product
development instead of cost of revenues. All prior periods presented have been
reclassified accordingly.

3. LINE OF CREDIT:
In May 1995, the Company entered into a line of credit agreement with a
bank. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, the outstanding balance
could not exceed $750,000, and interest was calculated at the bank reference
rate plus 15 percent 1025 percent at September 30, 1995. Borrowings were
limited to 70 percent of eligible accounts receivable, as defined. The
outstanding balance under the line of credit was $508,427 at September 30, 1995.
The line of credit agreement also contained restrictions on the Company
ability to pay dividends. Repayments under the line of credit were guaranteed by
three stockholders of the Company, and were secured by substantially all the
assets of the Company. The agreement expired May 30, 1996, by which time all
outstanding balances had been repaid.
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
During fiscal 1996 and 1995, a stockholder of the Company made advances to
the Company totaling $175,000 and $325,000, respectively. All advances were due
upon demand, but no later than one year from the date of the advance and bore
interest at rates ranging from 59 to 61 percent. The impact of imputing
interest at the market rate was not material. The advance was repaid with the
proceeds of the March 5, 1996 initial public offering See Note 11.
The Company paid approximately $90,000 in consulting fees to a director
during the years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997. The Company paid
approximately $36,000 for consulting to a company operated by an officer during
the year ended September 30, 1998.

For financial reporting purposes, a 100% valuation allowance has been
recorded at September 30, 1998 to offset the deferred tax assets recognized
under SFAS No. 109 as the Company has historically not achieved significant
levels of profitability, and there is inherent uncertainty as to when the
Company will achieve future profitability.
At September 30, 1998, the Company has approximately $8,793,000 and
$1,009,000 of federal tax net operating loss carryforward and tax credit
carryforward, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income
of the Company, if any. These carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2007.
Provisions under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 may limit the federal net
operating loss carryforward and credits available to be used in any given year
in the event of a significant change in ownership, including the March 5, 1996
initial public offering.

The Company has approximately $3,792,000 and $553,000 of California tax net
operating loss carryforward and research and development tax credit
carryforward, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income
of the Company, if any. The carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2000.
8. SALES TO MAJOR CUSTOMERS:
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998, five customers accounted
for approximately 52% of the Company revenues. Of those customers, two
accounted for over 10% of revenues. One customer represented 20% of total
revenues, while the other customer represented 11% of total revenues. Subsequent
to September 30, 1998, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina ceased
implementation of the DIAMOND-TM- 950C/S product. This customer accounted for 8%
of the Company total revenues for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998.
9. RETIREMENT PLAN:
The Company maintains a 401k retirement plan the Plan for full-time
employees. The plan year is from January 1 to December 31, and the discretionary
employer contribution is established at the end of the plan year. Participants
become fully vested after four years of service, although they vest
incrementally on an annual basis until the four-year period is completed. No
contributions were made during the fiscal years ended September 30, 1998 and
1997.
10. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS:
Effective August 5, 1994, the Company implemented the 1994 Stock Option Plan
1994 Plan and reserved 500,000 shares of stock for grants. However, since the
inception of the 1996 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan the Company no longer issues
stock options on the 1994 Plan.
On January 2, 1996, the Board of Directors authorized the 1996 Omnibus
Equity Incentive Plan 1996 Plan, under which the Company is authorized to
grant up to 500,000 shares of common stock to employees and consultants of the
Company. The number of authorized shares increased from 500,000 to 900,000
during fiscal 1997 and from 900,000 to 1,400,000 during fiscal 1998. The plan
allows incentive stock options to be granted to employees only, while
nonstatutory stock options may be granted to both employees and consultants.
Under the terms of the 1996 plan, incentive stock options to purchase shares of
the Company common stock must be granted at a price equal to the market price
of the stock at the date of grant, except for employees who, prior to the grant,
own more than 10 percent of the voting power of all stock. The exercise price
for such employees must be no less than 110 percent of the market price. For
nonstatutory stock options, the exercise price for both employees and
consultants will be no less than 85 percent of the market price. Both incentive
stock options and nonstatutory stock options may be exercised within ten years
from the date of grant, except for employees and consultants who own more than
10 percent of the voting power of all classes of stock. In this case, the
options may be exercised within a five-year period. Options generally vest over
a five-year period.
In October 1996, the Company Board of Directors approved the issuance of
300,000 shares under the Health Systems Design Corporation Employee Stock
Purchase Plan ESP Plan. The Plan allows for employees to purchase the
Company common stock at a 15% discount off the stock market value as defined
under the Plan. Employees began participating in the ESP Plan on January 1,
1998. As of September 30, 1998, the Company had issued 7199 shares under the ESP
plan.

10. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS: CONTINUED
In March 1997, the Company stockholders approved the Nonemployee Director
Stock Option Plan Director Plan, which is authorized to grant up to 60,000
shares to nonemployee directors of the Company. Members of the Board of
Directors are generally granted 5,000 options on the date of each annual meeting
which vest on the first anniversary of that meeting.
The Company accounts for the above plans under APB Opinion No. 25, under
which $78,795 was charged to deferred compensation in the year ended September
30, 1995 because certain options were granted at below the then fair market
value of the common stock. This deferred compensation is being amortized over
the vesting period of the related options. Amortization of deferred compensation
was $15,760 for each of the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996 and no
other compensation cost has been recognized under APB Opinion No. 25 as all
other options have been granted at an option exercise price equal to the market
value of common stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for these
plans been determined consistent with SFAS No. 123, the Company net loss in
total and per share would have been changed to the following pro forma amounts:
YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
1998     1997     1996
Net  As Reported $ 839,085 $3,856,304 $1,207,946
Pro Forma  $1,688,639 $4,180,109 $1,376,354
Basic  As Reported $   013 $   060 $   022
Pro Forma  $   026 $   065 $   024
Diluted  As Reported $   013 $   060 $   022
Pro Forma  $   026 $   065 $   024
Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to
options granted prior to October 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation
cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

10. STOCK OPTION PLAN AND WARRANTS: CONTINUED
The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions used for grants in 1998, 1997 and 1996: risk-free weighted average
interest rate of 515, 611 and 655 percent, respectively, expected dividend
yields of 0 percent, expected lives of 5 years from the date of grant and
expected volatility of 1030 percent for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and 986
percent for fiscal 1998.
In a December 1995 private placement, the Company issued $2,000,000 in notes
with warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company common stock at $500
per share. Upon repayment of the notes, the note holders executed warrants to
purchase 95,000 shares of the Company common stock. At September 30, 1998 and
1997, warrants to purchase 95,000 and 105,000 shares, respectively, of the
Company common stock were outstanding.
11. PUBLIC OFFERING
On March 5, 1996, the Company sold 1,855,000 shares of its common stock
through an initial public offering. As a result, the Company received net
proceeds of $21,722,965. A portion of the proceeds was immediately used to
retire short-term and long-term indebtedness to banks and other creditors. In
connection with the repayment of the private placement notes payable of
$2,000,000 of which $600,000 was paid to a stockholder, the Company recorded a
one-time, non-cash charge to interest expense of approximately $350,000 in
fiscal 1996 to reflect the write-off of deferred interest.
