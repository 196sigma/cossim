33              DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation -- The consolidated financial statements of Deltic
Timber Corporation Deltic or the Company include the accounts of Deltic
and all majority-owned subsidiaries after elimination of significant
intercompany transactions and accounts.
Use of Estimates -- In the preparation of the Company financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management has made
a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets and
liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results may differ from those estimates.
Cash Equivalents -- Cash equivalents include U.S. government securities that
have a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts -- The Company provides an allowance for
doubtful accounts based on a review of the specific receivables outstanding.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the balance in the allowance account was
$163,000 and $247,000, respectively.
Inventories -- Inventories of logs, lumber, and supplies are stated at the
lower of cost or market, primarily using the average cost method. Log costs
include harvest and transportation cost as appropriate. Lumber costs include
materials, labor, and production overhead. The Company no longer has
agricultural products in inventory as a result of the discontinuance of its
former Agriculture segment operations. For additional information, see Note
2 -Discontinued Agriculture Segment and Note 3 - Inventories.
Investment in Real Estate Held for Development and Sale -- Real estate held for
development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value,
and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs,
including amenities, less amounts charged to cost of sales. These costs are
allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value.
Direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis, while indirect
costs for the Company three development areas -- Chenal Valley, Chenal
Downs, and Red Oak Ridge -- are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire
respective development area.
Investment in Del-Tin Fiber -- Investment in Del-Tin Fiber L.L.C. Del-Tin
Fiber, a 50 percent owned limited liability company, is carried at cost and
is being adjusted for the Company proportionate share of its undistributed
earnings or losses.
Timber and Timberlands -- Timber and timberlands, which includes purchased
stumpage inventory and logging facilities, is stated at acquisition cost less
cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging
facilities. The cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber
harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable. Logging
facilities, which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land
improvements, are depreciated using the straight-line method over a 10-year
estimated life. The Company estimates its fee timber inventory using
statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and
other information gathering techniques. The cost of timber and timberland
purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized. Fee timber carrying costs
are expensed as incurred.
34              DELTIC TIMBER CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies cont.
Property, Plant, and Equipment -- Property, plant, and equipment is stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment, and
other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight-line
method. Property, plant, and equipment assets are evaluated for possible
impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets, as
applicable. Expenditures that substantially improve and/or increase the
useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and
repair costs are expensed as incurred. Gains and losses on disposals or
retirements are included in income as they occur.
Revenue Recognition -- Revenue from the sale of lumber, wood by-products, and
agricultural commodities is generally recorded at the time of shipment.
Revenue from the sale of timber-cutting rights to third parties is recorded
when legal title passes to the purchaser. Revenue from intersegment timber
sales is recorded when the timber is harvested; such intersegment sales,
which are made at market prices, are eliminated in the consolidated financial
statements. Revenue from real estate sales is recorded when the sale is
closed and legal title is transferred.
Income Taxes -- The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, the provision for income taxes includes
amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities,
based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the
tax bases of existing assets and liabilities, and is measured using the
enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences
reverse.
Stock-Based Compensation -- The Company applies the accounting measurement
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 25 to account for
stock-based compensation. Cost of options granted are accrued over applicable
vesting periods and adjusted for subsequent changes in the market value per
share of the Company common stock.
Capital Expenditures -- Capital expenditures include additions to Investment in
Real Estate Held for Development and Sale; Timber and Timberlands; and
Property, Plant, and Equipment.
Net Change in Purchased Stumpage Inventory -- Purchased stumpage inventory
consists of timber-cutting rights purchased from third parties specifically
for use in the Company sawmills. Depending on the timing of acquisition and
usage of this acquired stumpage inventory, the net change in inventory can
either be a source or use of funds in the Company Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows.
Earnings per Common Share -- Earnings per share EPS amounts presented were
calculated under the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS 128, Earnings per Share.
Basic earnings per share is computed based on earnings available to common
shareholders net income less accrued preferred dividends and the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding. The earnings per share assuming
dilution amounts presented are computed based on earnings available to common
shareholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
including shares assumed to be issued under the Company stock option plan.
For a reconciliation of amounts used in per share computations, see Note 17-
Earnings per Share.
Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements -- In June 1998, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, which is effective for the fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is required to and will adopt SFAS
133 effective January 1, 2001; however, the effect of adopting SFAS 133 will
not be material to the Company financial position or results of operations,
based on the Company current level of derivative and hedging activities.

AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies cont.
Reclassifications -- Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the 2000 presentation format. Note 2 - Discontinued Agriculture Segment
On August 17, 2000, the Company Board of Directors approved the disposal of
Deltic agriculture segment assets, subject to using the sales proceeds to
purchase additional pine timberland, in a tax-deferred exchange. As of
December 31, 2000, approximately 20,400 of the 38,800 net acres deemed to be
agriculture lands have been sold. All 18,400 net acres unsold as of the end of
2000 are under contract to be sold. The anticipated date for completion of the
disposal of agriculture segment assets is prior to the end of the first half of
2001. As a result of the sales transactions completed as of December 31, 2000,
a pretax gain on disposal of agriculture segment assets of $17,381,000 is
reported as discontinued operations by the Company in its 2000 Consolidated
Statement of Income. Operating results for the agriculture segment are also
reported as discontinued operations, net of income taxes, with prior years
restated to conform to the current year presentation.
The assets of the agriculture segment as of December 31, 2000, consisted
primarily of property, plant, and equipment and amounted to $3,626,000. Total
net sales of the discontinued agriculture segment for 2000, 1999, and 1998,
excluding land sales proceeds, were $8,272,000, $2,623,000, and $6,484,000,
respectively. Operating income of the agriculture segment during 2000, prior
to the measurement date for determining discontinued operations was $715,000,
$440,000 net of related taxes of $275,000. Gain on the disposal of the
agriculture segment was $17,150,000 before income taxes, consisting of the
$17,381,000 gain on sales of assets and $231,000 loss from operations since the
measurement date, $10,416,000 after related income taxes amounting to
$6,734,000.
Since the Company is disposing of the agriculture segment in a tax-deferred
exchange, all proceeds from farmland sales were deposited with a qualified
intermediary to be used to acquire pine timberland as replacement property. In
addition, Deltic also sold 5,200 net acres of non-strategic, hardwood
timberland during the third and fourth quarters of 2000, which will also be
replaced with pine timberland in a tax-deferred exchange. These combined
proceeds, $16,317,000 after deducting amounts expended to purchase replacement
pine timberland, are currently held by the intermediary, as trustee, and are
included in Other Investments and Noncurrent Receivables in the 2000
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
A portion of the farmland and hardwood timberland sales is deemed by the
Company to be related-party transactions. These transactions include sales to
Epps Plantation, LLC, which is owned by the Charles H. Murphy Family
Investments Limited Partnership. Charles Murphy holds a significant ownership
of the Company common stock and is related to four of the Company
directors. This related-party farmland sale amounted to $14,413,000 for 12,600
net acres. In addition, approximately 450 net acres were sold to Munoco Company
L.C. Munoco for $346,000. Munoco currently owns 8125 percent of an
undivided-interest farmland operation, conducting business as Ashly Plantation
a partnership for income tax purposes, of which Deltic owns 648 percent; the
managing partner of Munoco is Robert C. Nolan, Chairman of Deltic Board of
Directors and a nephew of Charles Murphy. The sales price for all related-party
farmland sale transactions was derived from an approved market index formula
which produced prices in excess of the average of the appraised value of the
acreage involved. Epps Plantation, LLC also purchased 2,600 net acres of the
hardwood timberland sold for $4,864,000.

AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 2 - Discontinued Agriculture Segment cont.
During the third quarter of 2000, Deltic and the other owners of Ashly
Plantation acted to acquire replacement property prior to the completion of the
disposal of its farmland, utilizing the form of a reverse exchange as
established by a recent IRS revenue procedure. As part of this transaction,
Ashly Plantation secured a note from the Company, in the amount of $4,000,000,
with the proceeds to be used as a portion of an advance, in the form of an
interest-bearing note, to the intermediate accommodating title owner required
for the reverse exchange. The accommodator used the funds provided by this
advance as a deposit to secure the desired replacement timberland. During the
fourth quarter of 2000, Deltic also acted to acquire replacement property prior
to the completion of the disposal of the remainder of its farmland by utilizing
a reverse exchange. The Company advanced funds to an accommodating title holder
which were used to acquire the designated timberland. This advance, which was
in the form of an interest-bearing note, combined with the similar advance by
Ashly Plantation to its accommodator, in addition to the Ashly Plantation
minority owners' portion of the note obtained from Deltic, amounted to
$16,364,000 at December 31, 2000, and is reported in the 2000 Consolidated
Balance Sheet in Other Investments and Noncurrent Receivables. Note 3 - Inventories
Inventories at December 31 consisted of the following                           
Thousands of dollars              2000  1999

For both financial and income tax purposes the Company utilizes the lower of
cost or market basis for determining inventory carrying values. Lumber
inventory at December 31, 2000, is stated at net realizable value and the 2000
Consolidated Statement of Income includes charges of $1,890,000 $1,114,000 of
which were during the fourth quarter for inventory write-downs which are
reflected in Cost of Sales. Note 4 - Investment in Del-Tin Fiber
Deltic owns 50 percent of the membership interest of Del-Tin Fiber, which
completed construction and commenced production operations of a medium density
fiberboard MDF plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, in April 1998. The cost to
construct the plant was approximately $104,000,000.
Del-Tin Fiber has its own credit facility, totaling $99,000,000, under which
each owner has agreed to a contingent equity contribution agreement with Del-
Tin Fiber and the group of banks from whom the project financing was obtained.
Under this agreement, both owners have agreed to fund any deficiency in
contributions to either Del-Tin Fiber bond sinking fund or debt service
reserve up to a cumulative total of $17,500,000 each. Del-Tin Fiber project
financing agreement does not require sinking fund contributions until 2001.
The quarterly contributions required are $1,046,000, beginning in the first
quarter of 2001. In addition, each owner has committed to a production support
agreement, under which each owner has agreed

to make support obligation payments to Del-Tin Fiber to provide, on the
occurrence of certain events, additional funds for payment of debt service if
the plant is unable to successfully complete a minimum production test, planned
for 2001. Both owners of Del-Tin Fiber have also pledged their respective
membership interest in the joint venture as collateral under the project
financing agreement.
As natural gas prices escalated during the last half of 2000, the decision was
made in late January 2001 to temporarily suspend operations of the facility
until its heat energy system could be modified. Following completion of a $28
million capital project to modify the heat energy system, the plant is expected
to resume operations in June 2001. Rectification of this system is anticipated
to enable Del-Tin Fiber operations to increase production levels closer to
the plant capacity of 150 million square feet per year and lower
manufacturing cost per thousand square foot, as fixed costs for the facility
are allocated to increased production. Both owners have agreed to fund their
respective share of the capital project, in addition to any operating working
capital needs until the facility is able to consistently generate sufficient
funds to meet its cash requirements.
Under the operating agreement, Del-Tin Fiber employees operate the plant.
Deltic has committed to provide a portion of the plant fiber and wood fuel
supply at market prices. During 2000 and 1999, Deltic sold Del-Tin Fiber
approximately $3,649,000 and $4,343,000, respectively, of these lumber
manufacturing by-products. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had a
receivable from Del-Tin Fiber of $61,000.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 4 - Investment in Del-Tin Fiber cont.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company share of the underlying net assets
of Del-Tin Fiber exceeded its investment by $398,000 and $567,000,
respectively. The excess relates primarily to interest received by the Company
from Del-Tin Fiber prior to plant start-up, which was capitalized by Deltic as
a reduction of its investment and is being amortized into income using the
straight-line method over a 60-month period.
The Company accounts for its investment in Del-Tin Fiber under the equity
method. Accordingly, the investment in Del-Tin Fiber is carried at cost,
adjusted for the Company proportionate share of undistributed earnings or
losses. Cumulative net losses for the facility have amounted to $49,048,000,
$24,524,000 net to the Company. As a result, no earnings have been available
for distribution to the owners. Contributions to Del-Tin Fiber by the Company
as of December 31, 2000, have amounted to $30,788,000.

Cost of fee timber harvested amounted to $7,224,000 in 2000, $5,012,000 in
1999, and $2,246,000 in 1998. Depreciation of logging facilities was $45,000,
$56,000, and $73,000 for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
The Company obtains a portion of its sawmill log requirements by acquiring
purchased stumpage inventory through cutting contracts with various private and
governmental landowners. These contracts have terms ranging from a few months
to several years. At December 31, 2000, the Company total commitment under
such contracts amounted to approximately $3,472,000. Based on lumber prices at
December 31, 2000, management estimated the fair value of stumpage under such
contracts to be approximately $187,000. Depending on the market value of this
stumpage at time of harvest, the Company sawmills may experience favorable or
unfavorable log supply costs. By February 1, 2001, the lumber market had
improved to the point that the estimated fair value of timber under these
contracts had increased to approximately $2,194,000.

1999, and $77,000 in 1998. Note 7 - Credit Facilities
In 1996, Deltic entered into an agreement with Bank of America and other
domestic banks which provides an unsecured, committed revolving credit facility
totaling $100,000,000. This agreement had an original expiration date of
December 31, 2001; however, as of March 9, 2001, the agreement has been
extended under the original terms until April 15, 2002. In addition, the
Company is currently involved in the process of renegotiating this line of
credit for an additional three to five years. As of December 31, 2000,
$53,000,000 of committed credit was available in excess of all borrowings
outstanding under or supported by the facility. Borrowings under the agreement
bear interest based upon prime or other various cost of funds options. Fees
associated with this revolving credit facility include a commitment fee of 15
to 35 percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitment balance. The
revolving credit agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants,
including a maximum funded debt/capitalization ratio of 5 to 1, which is to be
maintained throughout the term of the credit agreement.
The Company may also borrow up to $5,000,000 under a short-term credit facility
with BancorpSouth. The agreement expires May 8, 2001, with renewal annually.
The amount available to the Company under this facility is reduced by any
borrowings or outstanding letters of credit issued by Deltic. As of December
31, 2000, Deltic had borrowings of $800,000 outstanding under this line of
credit and letters of credit amounting to $341,000 were committed, resulting in
$3,859,000 available to the Company. Borrowings bear interest based upon the
New York Prime and the facility carries a commitment fee of 1 percent per
annum on the unused amount of the facility.
In addition, Deltic entered into an agreement with Regions Bank of Little Rock
which provides a $1,750,000 credit facility used primarily to support letters
of credit issued in connection with the Company purchased stumpage
procurement and real estate development operations. The agreement, which is
renewable annually, carries no facility fees and borrowings bear interest based
upon prime. Amounts available to Deltic under the facility are reduced by any
outstanding letters of credit, which amounted to $712,000 at December 31, 2000,
leaving $1,038,000 available to the Company. For additional information
regarding these financial instruments, see Note 12 -Fair Value of Financial
Instruments.

*Weighted average interest rate at December 31, 2000.
The $47,000,000 of notes payable designated as due in 2002 represents the
outstanding balance under the Company revolving credit facility agreement
with Bank of America and a group of other domestic banks. This current
agreement will expire on April 15, 2002.
During 1998, the Company successfully completed negotiation of the private
placement of $40,000,000 of senior notes with Pacific Coast Farm Credit
Services, ACA. These unsecured notes have a fixed stated interest rate of 67
percent and mature on December 18, 2008. No installment payments are required,
but the terms allow for prepayments at the option of the Company. The
agreement contains certain restrictive financial covenants, including a minimum
consolidated tangible net worth of the sum of $135,000,000, plus 25 percent of
cumulative consolidated adjusted net income from October 1, 1998, and a maximum
funded debt/capitalization ratio of 6 to 1. The Company incurred $226,000 of
costs related to the issuance of these notes, which was deferred and is being
amortized as additional interest expense over the term of the underlying debt.
In anticipation of issuance of these notes, the Company entered into and
settled an interest rate hedge contract. Upon settlement of this contract in
December 1998, the Company paid $1,081,000, which was deferred and is being
amortized as other debt expense over the term of the underlying debt, resulting
in an effective interest rate for these notes of approximately 69 percent.
The scheduled maturities of long-term debt for the next five years are $160,000
in 2001, $47,136,000 in 2002, $137,000 in 2003, and $137,000 in 2004. For

three years ended December 31, 2000.
Note 11 - Stockholders Rights Plan
The Company has a Stockholders Rights Plan, which provides for each eligible
common shareholder to receive a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right
Right for each outstanding share of the Company common stock held. The
Rights will expire on December 31, 2006, unless earlier exchanged or redeemed.
The Rights will detach from the common stock and become exercisable: 1
following a specified period of time after the date of the first public
announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, has become the beneficial
owner of 15 percent or more of the Company common stock or 2 following a
specified amount of time of the commencement of a tender or exchange offer by
any Acquiring Person, other than certain persons, which would, if consummated,
result in such persons becoming the beneficial owner of 15 percent or more of
the Company common stock. In either case, the detachment of the Rights from
the common stock is subject to extension by a majority of the directors of the
Company. The Rights have certain antitakeover effects and will cause
substantial dilution to any Acquiring Person that attempts to acquire the
Company without conditioning the offer on a substantial number of Rights being
acquired. The Rights are not intended to prevent a takeover, but rather are
designed to enhance the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to
negotiate with an acquiror on behalf of all shareholders. Other terms of the
Rights are set forth in, and the foregoing description is qualified in its
entirety by, the Rights Agreement between the Company and Harris Trust and

to approximate fair value based on the change in interest rates spread since
the notes' obligation dates.
Long-term debt, including current maturities -- The fair value is estimated
based on current rates at which the Company could borrow funds with similar
remaining maturities.
Redeemable preferred stock -- The fair value is based on the redemption amount
for the stock, discounted
using the Company estimated borrowing rate for debt instruments with
similar remaining maturities.
Letters of credit -- The fair value is based on the estimated cost to settle
these obligations.
Note 13 - Concentration of Credit Risks
Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to credit risk are
trade accounts receivable. These receivables normally arise from the sale of
wood products, primarily lumber. Concentration of credit with respect to these
trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers
comprising the Company customer base. No single customer accounted for a
significant amount of the Company sales of timber or wood products in 2000,
1999, or 1998. At December 31, 2000, one timber sale customer receivable
accounted for approximately 24 percent of the Company consolidated trade
accounts receivable amount; however, there were no significant accounts
receivable from a single customer at December 31, 1999.

Retirement Plans -- The Company has noncontributory, defined benefit retirement
plans that cover substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of
service, including those with Murphy Oil Corporation, and final career-
average-pay formulas as defined by the plans.
Thrift Plan -- Employees of the Company may participate in its thrift plan by
allotting up to a specific percentage of their base pay. The Company matches
contributions at a stated percentage of each employee allotment, based on
length of participation in the plan. Company contributions to this plan were
$281,000 in 2000, $259,000 in 1999, and $262,000 in 1998.
Postretirement Benefits -- The Company sponsors a plan that provides
comprehensive health care benefits supplementing Medicare benefits for those
eligible and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Costs are
accrued for this plan during the service lives of covered employees. Retirees
contribute a portion of the self-funded cost of health care benefits; the
Company contributes the remainder. The Company pays premiums for life
insurance coverage, arranged through an insurance company. The health care
plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company retains the right to
modify or terminate the benefits and/or cost sharing provisions.
In determining the accumulated benefit obligation for health care at December
31, 2000 and 1999, health care inflation cost was assumed to increase at an
annual rate of 85 percent in 2000 and 65 percent in 1999, decreasing 5
percent per year to 5 percent in 2007 and thereafter. A one percentage-point
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the
aggregate service and interest cost components of periodic benefit cost for
2000 by $68,000 and the benefit obligation by $391,000, while a one percentage-
point decrease in the assumed rate would decrease the 2000 cost components by
$60,000 and the benefit obligation by $359,000.

Note 15 - Incentive Plans
Stock Incentive Plan
The Company 1996 Stock Incentive Plan the Plan permits annual awards of
shares of the Company common stock to executives and other key employees.
Under the Plan, the Executive Compensation Committee the Committee is
authorized to grant: 1 stock options; 2 stock appreciation rights; and 3
restricted stock awards. Total annual options granted prior to 1999, excluding
any replacement options issued due to the spin-off from Murphy Oil Corporation,
could not exceed 5 percent of common shares issued and outstanding as of the
date of issuance of the options. These options could be nonqualified,
incentive, or a combination of the two. In 1999, the Plan was amended to allow
the Committee to award up to one percent of common shares issued and
outstanding at the end of the preceding year; any allowed shares not granted
may be available for grant in subsequent years. However, all options granted
under the amended plan are required to be nonqualified. The Company applies
APB 25 to account for stock-based compensation plans. Cost of options are
accrued over the vesting periods and adjusted for subsequent changes in market
value of the shares.
Stock Options -- For each option granted under the Plan, the Committee fixes
the option price at no less than market value on the date of the grant and
the option term, not to exceed 10 years from date of grant. Replacement
options granted were for 10 years from original grant date and nonqualified.
New options granted in 1997 and 1998 were for 10 years and primarily
incentive. Options granted since 1998 have been for 10 years and
nonqualified. All options have an option price no less than the market value
on the grant date, with a range in option prices of $990 to $2803 per
share, and each grantee is permitted to surrender options for equivalent
value of stock at the date of surrender. For options granted in 1997,
exclusive of replacement options, half may be exercised or surrendered after
two years and the remainder after three years. For options granted from 1998
through 2000, half may be exercised or surrendered after one year and the
remainder after three years.
Changes in options outstanding, including replacement options, consisted of

Stock Appreciation Rights -- Stock appreciation rights may be granted in
conjunction with, or independent of, stock options. The Committee determines
when these rights may be exercised and the price. No stock appreciation
rights have been granted.
Restricted Stock -- The Committee may award restricted stock to selected
employees, with conditions to vesting for each grant established by the
Committee. During the vesting period, the grantee may vote and receive
dividends on the shares, but shares are subject to transfer restrictions and
are all, or partially, forfeited if a grantee terminates, depending on the
reason. The grantee may be reimbursed by the Company for personal income tax
liability on the value of stock awarded.
Changes in shares of restricted stock outstanding consisted of the following                    2000   1999  1998

The fair value per share of restricted stock granted in 2000 and 1998 was
$2206 and $2803, respectively. Unearned compensation was charged for the
market value of the restricted shares. The unearned compensation is shown as
a reduction of shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
Unamortized Restricted Stock Awards, and is being amortized to expense over
the respective four-year restricted periods.
Stock-based compensation reflected in income was a charge of $255,000 in 2000,
$89,000 in 1999, and a benefit of $163,000 in 1998. Had cost of the Company
stock-based compensation plans been determined based on the fair value of the
instruments at the grant dates using the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company
net income and earnings per share would be the following pro forma amounts.     Thousands of dollars, except per share amounts   2000   1999  1998

Pro forma                    $ 90  66  45 For the pro forma net income calculation in the preceding table, the fair value
of each option on the date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model and the following assumptions for awards in 2000, 1999,
and 1998, respectively: dividend yields of 97 percent, 101 percent, and 70
percent; expected volatility of 3859 percent, 3799 percent, and 2522
percent; risk-free interest rates of 680 percent, 506 percent, and 574
percent; and expected lives of five years. Using these assumptions, the
weighted average grant-date fair value per share of options granted in 2000,
1999, and 1998 was $903, $942, and $862, respectively.
Incentive Compensation Plan
Cash Awards -- The Company has an Incentive Compensation Plan that provides for
annual cash awards to officers, directors, and key employees based on actual
results for a year compared to objectives established by the Executive
Compensation Committee, which administers the Plan, at the beginning of that
year. Initial awards under the Plan were granted in 1998, based on 1997
results of operations. Provisions for cash incentive awards of $722,000,
$575,000, and $270,000 were recorded in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.
Note 16 - Supplemental Cash Flows Disclosures
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $1,079,000, $5,770,000, and $5,753,000
in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Interest paid, net of amounts
capitalized, was $4,530,000, $4,074,000, and $1,285,000 in 2000, 1999, and
1998, respectively.
Noncash investing and financing activities excluded from the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows were assumptions of owner-financed debt, in the amount
of $696,000 in 1999 and $410,000 in 1998, related to acquisitions of land and
timber-cutting rights.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
December 31, 2000 Note 19 - Business Segments
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 131,
Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. SFAS 131
superseded and/or amended the business segment disclosures required under
various preceding pronouncements, effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1997, with earlier application encouraged. This standard defines
additional information to be disclosed for each reportable segment and requires
that each operating segment for which an enterprise chief operating decision
maker regularly assesses performance be disclosed as a reportable segment.
The Company four reporting segments consist of Deltic three operating
business units and its corporate function. Each reporting entity has a
separate management team and infrastructure that offers different products
and/or services.
Woodlands operations manage the Company Southern Pine timberlands located
primarily in Arkansas and north Louisiana and derive revenue from the harvest
of timber from the timberlands, in accordance with its harvest plans, and
either sells timber to third parties in the domestic market or to the Company
Mills segment for conversion into lumber.
The Mills segment consists of Deltic two sawmills which convert timber,
purchased from third parties or the Company Woodlands segment, into lumber.
These mills produce a variety of products, including dimension lumber, boards,
timbers, decking, and secondary manufacturing products, such as finger-jointed
studs. These products are sold primarily to wholesalers and lumber treaters in
the South and Midwest and used in residential construction, roof trusses,
laminated beams, and remanufactured items.
Real Estate operations, which currently include three separate real estate
developments, add value to former timberland by developing it into upscale,
planned residential and commercial developments. These developments, each of
which is centered around a core amenity, are being developed in stages. To-
date, real estate sales have consisted primarily of residential lots sold to
builders or individuals, commercial site sales, and sales of undeveloped
acreage. In addition, this segment currently leases retail space to third
parties in a retail center constructed by the Company, and held for sale, in
one of its developments. This segment also manages a real estate brokerage
subsidiary which currently generates commission revenue by reselling existing
homesites in one of the Company developments.
Corporate operations consist primarily of the planning, accounting, information
systems, human resources, treasury, income tax, and legal staff functions that
provide support services to the operating business units. The Company
currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to
its operating units.
In August 2000, the Company Board of Directors approved the disposal of
Deltic former Agriculture segment. As a result, operating results for the
Agriculture segment are reported as discontinued operations, with prior years
restated to conform to the current year presentation. For additional
information about the discontinuation of the Agriculture segment, see Note 2 -
Discontinued Agriculture Segment.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies. The Company evaluates
the performance of its segments based on operating income before equity in the
results of Del-Tin Fiber, an equity method investee; interest income and
expense; other nonoperating income or expense; and income taxes. Intersegment
revenues consist primarily of timber sales from the Woodlands segment to the
Mills operations.

The Shareholders
Deltic Timber Corporation The management of Deltic Timber Corporation has prepared and is responsible for
the Company consolidated financial statements. The statements are prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, appropriate in the circumstances. In preparing the financial
statements, management has, when necessary, made judgments and estimates with
consideration given to materiality.
The Company maintains internal control systems and related policies and
procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
against loss or unauthorized use, that the accounting records accurately reflect
business transactions, and that the transactions are in accordance with
management authorization. The design, monitoring, and revision of the systems
of internal control involve, among other things, our judgment with respect to
the relative cost and expected benefits of specific control measures. The
Company also maintains an internal auditing function which monitors the
effectiveness of the controls, while independently and systematically evaluating
and formally reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness of components of the
system.
The Company consolidated financial statements have been audited by KPMG LLP,
independent certified public accountants, who have expressed their opinion with
respect to the fairness of the consolidated financial statements. Their audit
was conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which include the consideration of the Company
internal controls to the extent necessary to form an independent opinion on the
consolidated financial statements prepared by management. The Board of
Directors appoints the independent auditors; ratification of the appointment is
solicited annually from the shareholders.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of directors who are
not officers or employees of the Company. The Committee meets periodically with
the certified public accountants, the Company internal auditor, and
representatives of management to review the Company internal controls, the
quality of its financial reporting, the scope and results of audits, and the
independence of the external auditors. The Company internal auditor and KPMG
LLP have unrestricted access to the Committee, without management presence, to
discuss audit findings and other financial matters. Clefton D. Vaughan

54              INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
The Board of Directors
Deltic Timber Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deltic Timber
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2000. These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Deltic Timber
Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. KPMG LLP

55            AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S LETTER
The Shareholders
Deltic Timber Corporation The Audit Committee the Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible
for providing independent oversight of the Company accounting functions and
internal controls. The members of the Committee are selected by the Board of
Directors. The Committee consists of five outside directors and operates under
a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. A copy of this charter
is included in the Company 2000 Proxy Statement. The Committee met five
times during 2000.
The Audit Committee also oversees the financial reporting process on behalf of
the Board of Directors. As part of this responsibility, the Committee assessed
the independence of the Company external auditors, utilizing written
disclosures received from such auditors as required by the Independence
Standards Board, and recommended to the Board of Directors, subject to
shareholder approval, the selection of the Company external auditors. The
Committee discussed the overall scope and specific plans for audit services with
the Company internal auditor and with KPMG LLP, the Company external
auditors. The Committee reviewed and discussed the quarterly financial
statements prior to the filing of the Company Form 10-Q. In addition, the
Committee also reviewed and discussed the Company audited consolidated
financial statements and adequacy of the Company internal controls and
discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required by Statements on Auditing Standards
61, Communication with Audit Committees. The Committee also met with the
internal auditor and KPMG LLP, without management present, to discuss the
results of their respective audits, their consideration of the Company
internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company financial reporting.
The meetings were also designed to facilitate any private communication with the
Committee desired by the internal auditor or KPMG LLP.
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee approved the
accompanying audited financial statements for inclusion in the annual report on
Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. John C. Shealy
