Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Zoran Corporation Sunnyvale, California 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Zoran Corporation and subsidiaries the Company as of
December31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for the years then ended. We also have audited the Companys internal control over
financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on criteria established inInternal ControlIntegrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Microtune, Inc., which was acquired on November 30, 2010 and whose
financial statements constitute approximately 35 percent of net assets, 30 percent of total assets, 2 percent of revenues and 3 percent of loss before income taxes of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December
31, 2010. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Microtune, Inc. The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanyingManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to
future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, based on the criteria established
inInternal ControlIntegrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2009 the Company adopted new accounting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board related to business combinations.

ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE1THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Zoran
Corporation Zoran or the Company was incorporated in California in December1981 and reincorporated in Delaware in November1986. Zoran develops and markets integrated circuits, integrated circuit cores and
embedded software used by original equipment manufacturers OEMs, in digital audio and video products for commercial and consumer markets, digital television applications and digital imaging products. Current applications incorporating
Zorans products and IP include digital versatile disc, or multimedia players and recorders, digital cameras, broadband receivers, professional and consumer video editing systems, digital speakers and audio systems, applications that enable the
delivery and display of digital video content through a set-top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print, scan, process and transmit documents to computer
peripherals that perform printing functions. The Company has two reportable segments, Consumer group and Imaging group. Principles of
consolidation and basis of presentation The Company reports its financial results on a calendar fiscal year. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zoran and all of its subsidiaries including Microtune, Inc. Microtune which was acquired on November30, 2010. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated
in consolidation. Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
Risks and uncertainties 
The Company participates in a dynamic high-technology industry. Changes in any of the following areas could have a material adverse effect
on the Companys future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows: reliance on limited number of suppliers; general economic conditions; advances and trends in new technologies; competitive pressures; changes in the overall
demand for its future products; acceptance of the Companys products; litigation or claims against the Company based on intellectual property, patent, regulatory, or other factors; and the Companys ability to attract and retain employees
necessary to support its growth. Translation of foreign currencies 
The majority of the Companys purchasing and sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of
the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company has not experienced material gain or losses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations. The Company may
take action in the future to reduce its foreign exchange risk. Monetary assets and liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at rates in effect at period-end and non-monetary
assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average rates during the period. Gains and losses arising from the translation of local currency financial statements are included in other expense,
net. The Company recorded foreign currency translation gain loss of $811,000, $28,000 and $830,000 for each of the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Revenue recognition 
The Companys policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment, provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the price is fixed and determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured and legal title and risk of ownership has transferred. A provision for estimated future returns and potential warranty liability is recorded at the time revenue is
recognized. Product returns and warranty expenses in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were immaterial. Development revenue under development contracts is recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract.
Amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the Companys obligations have been met. Costs associated with development revenues are included primarily in research and
development expenses. Revenue resulting from the licensing of the Companys technology is recognized when significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled and the customer has indicated acceptance. The Companys software license
agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis. Periodic service and maintenance fees which provide customers access to technical
support and minor enhancements to licensed releases are recognized ratably over the service or maintenance period. Royalty revenue is recognized in the period licensed sales are reported to the Company which typically ranges between one month to one
quarter in arrears. Revenue from software licenses is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met and, if applicable, when vendor specific objective evidence VSOE exists to allocate the total license fee to each element of
multiple-element software arrangements, including post-contract customer support. Post-contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract. When a contract contains multiple elements wherein the only undelivered element is
post-contract customer support and VSOE of the fair value of post-contract customer support does not exist, revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized ratably over the support period. Software royalty revenue is recognized based upon reports
received from licensees during the period, unless collectibility is not reasonably assured, in which case revenue is recognized when payment is received from the licensee. Revenue from cancellation fees is recognized when cash is received from the
customer. Business Combinations In December 2007, the FASB revised their guidance on business combinations. The new guidance requires an acquiring entity to measure and recognize identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at
the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions. The changes include the expensing of acquisition related transaction costs, the recognition of capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting for acquisition-related
restructuring cost accruals subsequent to the acquisition date and the recognition of changes in the acquirers income tax valuation allowance. Under the previous guidance, in-process research and development was expensed and acquisition costs
were capitalized as part of the purchase price consideration. The new guidance was effective for us beginning January1, 2009. 
Research and development costs Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred and include salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research, design and development activities and costs of
engineering materials and supplies. Cash equivalents and investments 
All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
The Company holds marketable securities which are classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. The
available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax, if any, 
54 Table of Contents
ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
included as accumulated other comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses realized upon sales of all such securities are reported in other expense,
net. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Companys available-for-sale marketable securities included corporate debt, U.S. government securities, auction rate securities, foreign bonds, municipal bonds, marketable equity securities and
certificate of deposits. See Note4. The Companys held-to-maturity securities are comprised of certificate of
deposits insured by FDIC. The carrying values of the held-to-maturity securities approximate fair value. At December31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $247,000 and $0 certificate of deposits as long term investment, respectively. The
certificate of deposits recorded under long term investments will mature in 2012. Other-than- temporary impairment 
All of the Companys available-for-sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. The Company recognizes an impairment
charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be other-than-temporary. The Company considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time and
extent to which the fair value has been less than the Companys cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the Companys intent and ability to hold, or whether it is more likely than not it will be
required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investments amortized cost basis. The Company recorded $302,000 other-than-temporary impairment OTTI charges on its available-for-sale securities in 2009. No OTTI was
recorded in 2010 or 2008. Concentration of credit risk of financial instruments 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and
cash equivalents, investments in marketable debt securities and trade accounts receivable. The Company places its cash in banks and cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper. The Company, by policy, limits the amount of its credit
exposure through diversification and restricting its investment purchases to highly rated securities only. Individual securities are limited to comprising no more than 10% of the portfolio value at the time of purchase. Highly rated securities are
defined as having a minimum Moody or Standard Poors rating of A2 or A respectively. The average maturity of the portfolio shall not exceed 24 months. The Company has not experienced any significant losses on its cash equivalents or
short-term investments. The Company markets integrated circuits and technology to manufacturers and distributors of
electronic equipment primarily in North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally
does not require collateral. Management believes that any risk of loss is significantly reduced due to the diversity of its customers and geographic sales areas. The following table summarizes the accounts receivable from significant customers representing 10% or more of the net accounts receivable balance: December31 2010 2009 Percentage of Accounts receivable, net Customer A 15 15 Customer B 11 13 Customer C 11 23 Customer D 10 13 Customer E 10

55 Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Inventory 
Inventory is stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis or market. Market is
based on estimated net realizable value. The Company writes down inventory to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected
inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped. The Company assesses the valuation of its inventory in each reporting period. Although the Company attempts to forecast future inventory demand, given the competitive pressures and cyclical nature
of the semiconductor industry, there may be significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments that could have a significant impact on the value of the Companys inventories and reported operating results. 
Inventory write downs inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about expected future demand and the impact of market conditions on
those assumptions. Although the Company believes that the assumptions it used in estimating inventory write downs are reasonable, significant changes in any one of the assumptions in the future could produce a significantly different result. There
can be no assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant inventory write downs. Property and
equipment Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets, which are generally three to five years for computer equipment, five years for furniture, machinery and equipment and three years for software. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease. Goodwill 
Goodwill is not amortized. The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting
unit, annually, or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. See Note 6. 
Intangible Assets 
Intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, developed technologies, in-process research and development and trade names
were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Oak Technology,Inc., Emblaze Semiconductor, Ltd., Oren Semiconductor, Inc., Let It Wave and Microtune. The net intangible assets as of December31, 2010 and 2009 relate to Microtune and
Let It Wave and are being amortized over the estimated useful lives of one to nine years. The fair value of in-process
research and development is recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which time the intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life, or abandoned, at which time the intangible asset
is expensed prior to fiscal 2010, in-process research and development was expensed at the acquisition date. Long-lived assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill, whenever events or changes in
circumstance indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates these assets by comparing expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related assets. If the expected undiscounted cash flows
are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge based on the fair value of the assets. See Note 6. 
56 Table of Contents
ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Fair value of financial instruments 
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their respective fair
values because of the short-term maturity of these items. See Note 5. Income taxes 
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets
for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on the Companys ability to generate
sufficient future taxable income. As of December31, 2010, historical operating income and projected future profits represented sufficient positive evidence that the realization of $549 million of the Companys deferred tax assets are
more likely than not. In certain material jurisdictions, where future income is less certain, the company has recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until such time as it is more likely than not that those assets will be
realized. The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. The Company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. Actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates and
could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined. The Companys effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide earnings or losses, the tax regulations and tax holiday benefits in certain jurisdictions, and
the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies. The Companys Israel based subsidiary is an Approved Enterprise under Israeli law, which provides a ten-year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of the Companys
operations in Israel. The Companys U.S. federal net operating losses expire at various times between 2017 and 2029, and the benefits from the Companys subsidiarys Approved Enterprise status expire at various times beginning in
2012. Earnings per share The Company reports Earnings Per Share EPS, both basic and diluted, on the consolidated statement of operations. Basic EPS is based upon the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding plus any potential common stock, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock includes common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock
options, employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock units. Stock- based compensation 
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards
Codification ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation, using the modified prospective application transition method, which establishes accounting for stock-based awards exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based
compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period. During
the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of January1, 2006 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure
under share-based payments guidance were in effect for expense recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. For these awards, the Company has continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated amortization method. For
stock-based awards granted 
57 Table of Contents
ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
after January 1, 2006, the Company recognized compensation expense based on the grant date fair value required share-based payments guidance. For these awards, the Company recognized compensation
expense using a straight-line amortization method. As the share-based payments guidance requires that stock-based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest, estimated stock-based compensation for the years ended

NOTE 2ACQUISITION 
Microtune, Inc. On
November30, 2010 the closing date, the Company completed the acquisition of Microtune, a receiver solutions company that designs and markets advanced radio frequency RF and demodulator electronics for worldwide
customers based in Plano, Texas. The Company acquired Microtune, among other things, to enhance its position in the core markets it serves and expand its worldwide presence, improving its ability to serve its customers as a single point-of-service
provider. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement dated September7, 2010, the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Microtunes common stock at $292 per share for a total payment of $1592 million in cash. In addition, the

related costs, including advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees, of $41 million which were expensed in 2010. Fiscal 2008
Acquisitions Let It Wave On June12, 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of Let It Wave, a fabless development-stage semiconductor company based in Paris, France. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the
Company acquired Let It Wave in an all-cash transaction valued at $240 million, including approximately $650,000 of transaction costs. The Company also agreed to make contingent payments up to $45 million in additional

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
consideration, subject to the completion of certain milestones as well as continuous employment. The milestones were not achieved and thus there were no payments in relation to the milestones.
All contingent payments have been completed as of December31, 2010. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to
obtain Let It Waves in-process development of a video frame rate conversion and image enhancement technology for flat panel televisions and other consumer electronics. By acquiring Let It Wave, the Company intends to deliver high performance
image processing that enables artifact-free true-Motion Compensated Frame Rate Conversion MCFRC for flat panel televisions and other video consumer electronics products. Let It Wave currently has no other products, revenues or a
customer base. The development of the in process technology was completed in the second quarter of 2009 as anticipated and the technology is being marketed for 120Hz LCD televisions within the Consumer group. The Company accounted for this
transaction as an asset acquisition. The results of operations of Let It Wave have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Allocation of the purchase price was as follows in thousands:  In-process research and development 22,383 Assembled workforce 1,305 Net assets acquired 340 24,028 Net assets acquired were recorded at net book value, which approximates their fair values. The purchase
price in excess of the fair values of net assets acquired was allocated to in-process research and development and assembled workforce based on the relative fair values. The in-process research and development had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. Accordingly the amount allocated to in-process research and development was
immediately expensed upon the acquisition date. The value of in-process research and development was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable,
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 15%. This rate was based on the industry segment for the technology, nature of the products to be developed, relative risk of successful development, time-value of
money, length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team. As of December31, 2010, there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation
of the value of the acquired entity. NOTE 3BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS in thousands December31 2010 2009 Accounts receivable Trade 23,293 22,475 Less: allowance for doubtful accounts1 478 478 22,815 21,997  1

2010 to July2, 2012 for a price equal to par value. In exchange for the issuance of the ARS Rights, the UBS affiliates have the discretionary right to sell the Companys eligible ARS on the Companys behalf, without prior
notification, at any time during a two-year period beginning June30, 2010. In connection with its acceptance of the UBS
Offer during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company transferred its ARS from investments available-for-sale to trading securities.The transfer to trading securities reflects managements intent to exercise its ARS Rights on June30,
2010 and as a result has classified these ARS as short-term investments. Prior to its agreement with UBS, the Company classified the related ARS as investments available-for-sale.

years ended December31, 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The Companys investment policy focuses on three
objectives: to preserve capital, to meet liquidity requirements and to maximize total return. The Companys investment policy establishes minimum ratings for each classification of investment and investment concentration is limited in order to
minimize risk, and the policy also limits the final maturity on any investment and the overall duration of the portfolio. Given the overall market conditions, the Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to ensure adherence to its
investment policy and to monitor individual investments for risk analysis and proper valuation. The Company holds its
marketable securities as trading and available-for-sale and marks them to market. The Company expects to realize the full value of all its marketable securities upon maturity or sale, as the Company has the intent and believes it has the ability to
hold the securities until the full value is realized. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that its invested cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets, which may
require the Company to record an impairment charge that could adversely impact its financial results. NOTE 5FAIR VALUE
When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair
value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  Level 1Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 consists of publicly traded equity securities which are
valued primarily using quoted market prices utilizing market observable inputs as they are traded in an active market with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.  Level 2Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. The Company
uses observable market prices for comparable instruments to value its fixed income securities. 
66 Table of Contents
ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
Level 3Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well
as significant management judgment or estimation. The Company had no assets or liabilities utilizing Level
3 inputs as of December31, 2010 and had utilized Level 3 inputs for the Auction Rate Securities ARS held as of December31, 2009.

valued using quoted market prices. Short-term investments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued based on other observable inputs, including broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources. When
other observable market data is not available, the Company relies on non-binding quotes from an independent broker. Non-binding quotes are based on proprietary valuation models. These models use algorithms based on inputs such as observable market
data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, historical pricing trends of a security as relative to its peers, internal assumptions of the broker and statistically supported models. The types of instruments valued based on other observable
inputs include corporate notes and bonds, U.S. Government agency securities, foreign municipal bonds and certificate of deposits. We reviewed our financial and non-financial assets and liabilities for 2010 and 2009 and concluded that there were no
material impairment charges needed.

At December31, 2009, the Company held ARS with a par
value of $349 million.The Companys ARS were high grade, long-term debt instruments backed by student loans which are guaranteed by the United States government.All of the Companys ARS had credit ratings of AAA or AA, and
none were mortgage-backed debt obligations. The Company also heldSeries C-2 Auction Rate Securities Rights ARS Rights that entitled the Company to sell its eligible ARS to UBS or its affiliates during the period from
June30, 2010 to July2, 2012 for a price equal to par value. In exchange for the issuance of the ARS Rights, UBS or its affiliates had the discretionary right to sell the Companys eligible ARS on the Companys behalf, without
prior notification, at any time during a two-year period beginning June30, 2010. On July1, 2010, the Company exercised its right and redeemed the remaining ARS at par value. 
The enforceability of the ARS Rights resulted in a put option and was recognized as a free standing asset separate from the related ARS.
The Company measured the ARS Rights at fair value under the Financial Instruments-Overall-Scope Section of ASC, which permitted an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets, in order to match the changes in the fair value
of the related ARS. As a result, unrealized gains and losses were included in earnings. The Company exercised its right and redeemed the ARS on July1, 2010.

The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or sooner if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill as of September30, 2010. The Company has two reportable segmentsConsumer and
Imaging. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level which is one level below the reportable segments. Potential goodwill impairment is measured based upon a two-step process. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value of a
reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If
the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is

performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss. The fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows. The total of all reporting unit
fair values was also compared to the Companys market capitalization plus a control premium for reasonableness. The Company utilized a cash flow forecast of 3 years, discount rate of 33% and terminal value growth rates of 5%. There were no
triggering events or indicators of impairment during the fourth quarter of 2010 that would lead us to believe goodwill had been impaired as of December31, 2010. As of September30, 2010, the Company determined that the fair value of its Imaging segment reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. In the
fourth quarter of 2010, the Company reviewed the significant assumptions and key estimates used in the September30, 2010 impairment analysis and concluded the judgments used in the analysis remained appropriate and no impairment charges needed
to be booked as of December31, 2010. On November30, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of Microtune
which resulted in an increase in goodwill of $159 million and an increase in purchased intangible assets of $338 million. As of December31, 2010, there were no triggering events or indictors of impairment that would lead the Company to
believe goodwill and intangible assets should be impaired. In 2009, the Company determined that the fair value of its Imaging
segment reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. In 2008, The
Company conducted its annual impairment test of goodwill as of September30, 2008 assumed a cash flow period of 10 years, long-term annual growth rate of 9% to 13%, discount rates of 33% to 38% and terminal value growth rates of 5%. As a result
of this test, the Company determined that the carrying amounts for both of the Consumer segment reporting units exceeded their fair values and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $1645 million and an impairment charge for
purchased technology, customer base, tradename and other intangibles of $31 million in 2008. The impairment charge was primarily due to a decrease in valuation based on a decline in the Companys business forecasts as a result of the current
economic downturn as well as a significant decline in the Companys stock value over the last two quarters due to the global financial crisis at that time.

Legal proceedings 
Xpoint Technologies, Inc. v. Zoran Corporation On September18, 2009, Xpoint Technologies, Inc. filed an amended complaint against the Company and 43 other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint
alleges that the Companys manufacture and sale of digital camera processors, including its Coach9, Coach 10 and Coach 12 lines of processors, infringe one or more of the claims of United States Patent No5,913,028. Since filing the
amended complaint, Xpoint has also identified the Companys Coach 8 processor as an additional allegedly infringing product. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, a preliminary and permanent injunction against further infringement, a finding
of willful infringement, enhanced damages, attorneys fees and costs. The Company filed an answer and a counterclaim. The Companys counterclaim seeks an order declaring that it did not infringe the patent and that the patent is invalid.
The case is in its early stages. The parties are currently engaged in discovery, and the Companys potential loss, if any, is not reasonably estimable at this time. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations made by
Xpoint in this lawsuit. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the ultimate outcome of the action will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for a
particular period or on the trading price of the Companys Common Stock. Advanced Processor Technologies LLC v. Analog Devices, Inc.,
et al. On January18, 2011, Advanced Processor Technologies LLC APT filed a complaint against the
Company and eight other defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that the Company and each of the other defendants manufactures, uses, sells, imports, and/or offers for sale data
processors with memory management units MMUs, or products containing such devices, that directly infringe one or more of the claims of United States Patent No6,047,354 and that products of the Company and certain of the other
defendants also directly infringe one or more of the claims of United States Patent No5,796,978. The complaint does not specify which of the Companys products allegedly infringe the APT patents. The complaint seeks unspecified damages
for past infringement and either a permanent injunction against future infringement or the award of a reasonable royalty for such infringement. Pursuant to a stipulation, the Company will respond to the complaint on or before April15, 2011.
The case is in its preliminary stages, and discovery has not yet commenced. Accordingly, the Companys potential loss, if any, is not reasonably estimable at this time. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations
made by APT in this lawsuit. However, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the ultimate outcome of the action will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows
for a particular period or on the trading price of the Companys Common Stock. Litigation Related to the Merger 
On February23, 2011, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court by Judy Kauffman Goldstein, an alleged
stockholder of Zoran Corporation Zoran who seeks to represent a class comprised of Zoran stockholders. The complaint in this action the Goldstein complaint names as defendants Zoran, each member of Zorans board of
directors, CSR plc CSR and Zeiss Merger Sub, Inc. Zeiss. The Goldstein complaint alleges that the director defendants breached fiduciary duties assertedly owed to Zoran and its stockholders by entering into the merger
agreement with CSR that was announced on February22, 2011; that CSR and Zeiss aided and abetted the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty; and that if the merger is allowed to proceed, the stockholders will suffer damages because their shares
will be acquired for less than their actual value. The plaintiff seeks an order of the Court certifying the action as a class action; rescinding the merger and/or preliminarily enjoining the defendants from consummating the merger; enjoining the
defendants from taking any further action to interfere with a consent solicitation previously commenced by Ramius Value and Opportunity Master Fund Ltd. Ramius; and/or awarding damages, attorneys fees and costs.

ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
On February25, 2011, a second purported class action
was filed in the same court by Lawrence Zucker, an alleged stockholder of Zoran, who seeks to represent the same purported class. The complaint in this action the Zucker complaint names as defendants the members of Zorans board
of directors and Zoran. The allegations contained in the Zucker complaint are largely similar to the allegations contained in the Goldstein complaint, except that the Zucker complaint also alleges that Zoran aided and abetted alleged breaches of
fiduciary duty by the director defendants; does not name CSR or Zeiss as defendants; and does not allege that CSR or Zeiss aided or abetted any alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff seeks similar relief to that sought in the Goldstein
complaint, except that the Zucker complaint does not seek any relief with respect to the Ramius consent solicitation. Indemnification
Obligations The Companys Amended and Restated Bylaws require the Company to indemnify its directors and authorize
the Company to indemnify its officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law the DGCL. In addition, each of the Companys current directors and officers has entered into a separate indemnification
agreement with the Company. The Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of directors to the Company or its stockholders to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL. The obligation to indemnify generally means that
the Company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with these matters. Other Legal Matters The Company is named from time to time as a party to
lawsuits in the normal course of its business, such as the matter described above. Litigation in general, and intellectual property litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of
legal proceedings are difficult to predict. The Company accrues for contingent liabilities when it determines that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and that the amount of such liability can be
reasonably estimated. During 2010, 2009 and 2008 the Company incurred $11 million, $118 million and $0 of costs, respectively, in connection with settlement of disputes. NOTE 8STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY 1993 Stock Option Plan

approved by the stockholders of the Company in July1993. A total of 7,755,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 1993 Option Plan. The 1993 Option Plan provided for grants of options to employees, non-employee
directors and consultants. The 1993 Stock Option Plan expired during 2003 and no future shares will be granted under this plan. The option price for shares granted under the 1993 Option Plan was typically equal to the fair market value of the common

of grant, subject to the Companys right to repurchase from an optionee, at the optionees original per share exercise price, any unvested shares which the optionee has purchased and holds in the event of the termination of the
optionees employment, with or without cause. The Companys right lapses as shares subject to the option become vested. Such shares generally vest in monthly installments over two or four years following the date of grant as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, subject to the optionees continuous service. Options expire ten years from the date of grant and an option shall generally terminate three months after termination of employment.

The Companys 2000 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan the 2000 Option Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Company in October2000. A total of 450,000 shares of preferred stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2000 Option Plan. The options to purchase preferred stock automatically converted to options to purchase common stock upon the
amendment of the Companys certificate of incorporation to affect an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to 55,000,000 in October2000. A total of 13,325,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under
the 2000 Option Plan. The 2000 Option Plan provided for grants of options to employees or consultants. The 2000 Option Plan was modified in 2001 to allow for exercisability of stock options ahead of vesting subject to the Companys right to
repurchase the associated stock at the option exercise price lapsing during the course of original vesting schedule. The option price for shares granted under the 2000 Option Plan was typically equal to the fair market value of the common stock at
the date of grant. Options expire ten years from the date of grant and the right to exercise an option generally terminates three months after termination of employment. The 2000 Stock Option Plan was terminated in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005
Equity Incentive Plan. 1995 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan 
The Companys Outside Directors Stock Option Plan the 1995 Directors Plan was adopted by the Companys Board of
Directors in October1995, and was approved by its stockholders in December1995. A total of 525,000 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the 1995 Directors Plan. The 1995 Directors Plan provided for the grant of
nonstatutory stock options to nonemployee directors of the Company. The 1995 Directors Plan provided that each new nonemployee director would automatically be granted an option to purchase 30,000 shares on the date the optionee first became a
nonemployee director the Initial Grant. Thereafter, on the date immediately following each annual stockholders meeting, each nonemployee director who was reelected at the meeting to an additional term was granted an additional

installments, and each Annual Grant became exercisable in full one year after the date of grant, subject to the directors continuous service. The exercise price of all stock options granted under the 1995 Directors Plan was equal to the fair
market value of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 1995 Directors Plan have a term of ten years. This plan was terminated in July 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Plan.

2005 Plan. Such awards may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, deferred stock units and other stock-based or cash-based awards. The 2005 Plan is
administered by the Compensation Committee or other committee or subcommittee of the Board of Directors or by the Board of Directors and has a term of 10 years. Employees and consultants of Zoran and its subsidiaries and other affiliates are
eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. Options and stock appreciation rights granted under the 2005 Plan must have
exercise prices per share not less than the fair market value of Zoran common stock on the date of grant and may not be repriced without stockholder approval. Such awards will vest and become exercisable upon conditions established by the
Compensation Committee and may not have a term exceeding 10 years.

Except with respect to 5% of the number of shares authorized
under the 2005 Plan, awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other full value awards granted under the 2005 Plan generally must have service-based vesting schedules of at least three years or a
performance period of at least 12 months. However, restricted stock or restricted stock units issued pursuant to a stockholder-approved option exchange program which vest based on service must have a vesting schedule of at least two years.
Performance share and performance unit awards vest to the extent that pre-established performance goals based on one or more measures of business and financial performance authorized by the 2005 Plan are attained during a performance period
established by the Compensation Committee. The Company has not issued any performance based awards for each of the periods ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The grant or vesting of other types of awards under the 2005 Plan
may similarly be based on the attainment of one or more such performance goals. The 2005 Plan provides that the number of shares remaining available for issuance will be reduced by 161 shares for each one share of Zoran common stock subject to a
full value award granted under the 2005 Plan. At December31, 2010, 4,980,341 shares of the Companys common stock
were available for the grant of stock options and other awards under the 2005 Plan, subject to the provisions described above that reduce the number of shares available for full value awards. 2005 Outside Directors Equity Plan The 2005 Outside Directors Equity Plan
the 2005 Directors Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in May 2005 and replaced the 1995 Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, which was terminated by the Board of Directors upon stockholder approval of the 2005 Directors Plan in
July 2005. Such awards may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and deferred stock units. The 2005 Directors Plan is generally administered by the Board of Directors and has a term of 10 years. Participation in
the 2005 Directors Plan is limited to non-employee members of the Zoran Board of Directors outside directors. The 2005 Directors Plan provides that the number of shares remaining available for issuance will be reduced by 161 shares
for each one share of Zoran common stock subject to a full value award granted under the 2005 Directors Plan. Awards under
the 2005 Directors Plan are granted by the Board of Directors to all outside directors on a periodic, nondiscriminatory basis within limits prescribed by the 2005 Directors Plan. Subject to appropriate adjustment for any change in the Companys
capital structure, awards granted to any outside director in any fiscal year may not exceed 20,000 shares, increased by one or more of the following: 40,000 shares upon an outside directors initial election, 10,000 shares for service as
Chairman of the Board or Lead Director, 5,000shares for service on a Board committee as chairman and 2,500 shares for service on a Board committee other than as chairman. Stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and
deferred stock units granted under the Directors Plan are generally subject to terms substantially similar to those applicable to the same type of award granted under the 2005 Plan. 
At December31, 2010, 615,000 shares of the Companys common stock were available for the grant of the options and other awards
under the 2005 Directors Plan, subject to the provisions described above that reduce the number of shares available for full value awards.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the
year ended December31, 2010 was $73,000. The total cash received from employees as a result of employee stock option exercises during the year ended December31, 2010 was approximately $364,000. The Company recognized a cost of $424,000
and $385,000 due to the shortfall in tax deductions for options exercised during 2010 and 2009, respectively, when compared with the GAAP estimate of future tax benefit. There was no cost or excess tax benefit realized by the Company in 2008 for
option exercises. As of December31, 2010, the Company had $137 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation cost
related to stock options after estimated forfeitures, which are expected to be recognized over an estimated weighted period of 242 years. The Company settles employee stock option exercises with newly issued common shares. The Company estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions: Stock Option Plans Stock Purchase Plan 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Average expected term years 56 56 55 125 125 129 Expected volatility 52 55 54 54 56 54 Risk-free interest rate 22 22 28 11 14 21 Dividend yield 0 0 0 0 0 0
% Expected Term: The
expected term represents the period that the Companys stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and was determined based on the Companys historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of
the stock-based awards and vesting schedules. Expected Volatility: The Company uses historical volatility in deriving
its volatility assumption. Management believes that historical volatility appropriately reflects the markets expectations of future volatility. Risk-Free Interest Rate: Management bases its assumptions regarding the risk-free interest rate on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. 
Expected Dividend: The Company has not paid and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the near future. 
Tender Offer On
November12, 2009, the Company filed a tender offer on Schedule TO Tender Offer with the SEC and commenced an offer to current employees to exchange outstanding options with exercise prices greater than $1200 per share, were
granted before November12, 2007 and had a term that was scheduled to expire after November12, 2011 for restricted stock units based upon 35 to 1 ratio. The restricted stock units granted as part of this exchange vest over a period of three years. The tender offer provided that the option holders could and must submit their election to participate in the
tender offer no later than December10, 2009. This tender offer was not available to the Companys executive officers and members of its board of directors. The Company completed the Tender Offer on December10, 2009. As a result, the Company accepted for exchange options to purchase an aggregate of 1,792,097 shares of the Companys common stock

453eligible participants, representing 68% of the shares subject to options that were eligible to be exchanged in the Offer to Exchange as of November12, 2009. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Tender Offer to Exchange, the Company issued restricted stock units covering an aggregate of 512,038 shares of the Companys common stock in exchange for the options surrendered pursuant to the Tender
Offer to Exchange. The Company accounted for the exchange as a modification under ASC 718. The incremental compensation cost
of the restricted stock units on December10, 2009, the date of cancellation, was measured as the excess of the fair value of the restricted stock units over the fair value of the options immediately before cancellation based on the share price
and other pertinent factors at that date. The incremental cost of the 512,038 restricted stock units was approximately $889,000. The unrecognized compensation costs of the 1,792,097 options cancelled were $31 million. The fair value of the
restricted stock units was measured as the total of the unrecognized compensation cost of the original options tendered and the incremental compensation cost of the restricted stock units on December10, 2009, the date of the cancellation. The
total fair value of the restricted stock unit awards on December10, 2009 will be amortized over the service period of the restricted stock unit awards. Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units The Company adopted
the Microtunes amended and restated 2000 stock plan and 2010 stock plan in connection with the acquisition. Restricted shares and restricted stock units are granted under the Companys 2005 Plan and Microtunes amended and restated
2000 plan and 2010 plan. As of December31, 2010, there was $98 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units. This cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining term
of 236 years. The following is a summary of restricted shares and restricted stock units activities under the Companys

$1000 million of outstanding Zoran common stock. The amount and timing of specific repurchases under this program are subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including managements discretion. Repurchases
may be in open-market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions, and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the board of directors at any time. There is no guarantee of the exact number of shares that will
be repurchased under the program. As of December31, 2010 and 2009, the authorized amount that remains available under
the Companys stock repurchase program was $513 million and $802 million, respectively. The Company retires all shares repurchased under the stock repurchase program. The purchase price for the repurchased shares of the Companys stock
repurchased is reflected as a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. Stock repurchase activities during
the year ended December31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:  TotalNumberof

NOTE 9RETIREMENT AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
The Company maintains a 401k Plan that covers substantially all of the Companys U.S. employees. Participants may elect to
contribute a percentage of their compensation to this plan, up to the statutory maximum amount prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has the ability to make a discretionary matching contribution to the 401k Plan based on a uniform
percentage of the employees eligible contribution up to a maximum employer match of $2,000 per year per employee. Approximately $536,000, $546,000 and $556,000 in matching contributions were recorded during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
Under Israeli law, the Company is required to make severance payments to its retired or dismissed Israeli employees and
Israeli employees leaving its employment in certain other circumstances. The Companys severance pay liability to its Israeli employees, which is calculated based on the salary of each employee multiplied by the years of such employees
employment, is reflected in the Companys balance sheet in other long-term liabilities on an accrual basis, and is partially funded by the purchase of insurance policies in the name of the employees. The surrender value of the insurance
policies is recorded in other assets. The severance pay detail is as follows in thousands: Year Ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Accrued severance included in other long-term liabilities 17,106 14,409 13,987 Less: amount funded included in other assets 16,629 14,019 12,577 Unfunded portion, net accrued severance pay 477 390 1,410 NOTE 10EARNINGS PER SHARE The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per share computations for the periods presented in thousands except per share amounts: Year ended December31 2010 2009 2008 Net loss 47,636 32,958 215,727 Basic and dilutive weighted average shares outstanding 50,152 51,464 51,350 Basic and diluted net loss per share 095 064 420 For the years ended December31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 outstanding options and restricted stock units

Deferred income tax assets comprise the following:

$3380 million for federal, $726 million for state tax, and $1839 million in various foreign jurisdictions. The federal NOLs expire on various dates between 2017 and 2029. The state NOLs expire beginning in 2012 and the foreign NOLs do not expire.
The Company currently expects that $1726 million of the federal and $17 million of the state NOLs will expire before they can be utilized. As of December31, 2010, the Company had tax credits of approximately $214 million for federal tax
purposes which expires beginning in 2011 and $156million for state tax purposes, most of which do not expire. The Company expects that $107 million of the federal credits will expire before they can be utilized. The assets which are expected
to expire before being utilized have been removed from the balance sheet. The tax provision for the year ended
December31, 2010 of $143 million primarily reflects accrued tax liabilities in the Companys profitable jurisdictions plus a deferred tax charge of $83 million to establish a valuation allowance on all our California deferred tax
assets. The provision for income taxes for year ended December31, 2009 primarily reflects accrued tax liabilities in the Companys profitable jurisdictions. The Company assesses, on a quarterly basis, the realizability of its deferred tax assets by evaluating all available evidence, both positive and negative, including: 1the cumulative results of
operations in recent years, 2the nature of recent losses, 3estimates of future taxable income and 4the length of operating loss carryforward periods. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Companys operating
results for the California return changed from three year positive cumulative earnings to three year negative cumulative earnings and a valuation allowance was recorded on certain assets in that jurisdiction. The cumulative three-year loss was
considered significant negative evidence which was objective and verifiable and thus was heavily weighted. Additional negative evidence Zoran considered at that time included projections of future losses in that jurisdiction for 2011 and beyond, the
historic volatility of the semiconductor industry and the highly competitive nature of the Digital TV, STB and Mobile markets in which Zoran operates. Positive evidence considered by Zoran in its assessment at that time included lengthy operating
loss carryforward periods, and a lack of unused expired operating loss carryforwards in Zorans history. After
considering both the positive and negative evidence for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, Zoran determined that it was still more likely than not that it would not realize the full value of certain foreign deferred tax assets. Negative
evidence included a three year negative cumulative earnings in certain jurisdictions as well as projections for continued losses in those jurisdictions. As a result, Zoran maintained a valuation allowance against certain tax assets to reduce them to
their estimated net realizable. In other jurisdictions we had cumulative

ZORAN CORPORATION 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued 
positive earnings in recent years which are verifiable and therefore heavily weighted such that the remaining deferred tax assets did not require a valuation allowance. 
The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, was signed into law in December 2010.
Under the Act, the research credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after January1, 2010 and before January1, 2012. The effect of the change resulted in an estimated tax benefit of $803,000 in 2010. 
As of December31, 2010, the Company has $372 million of unrecognized tax benefits all of which would benefit the Companys
tax expense if realized in the future. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10 Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes on January1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of this guidance, in 2008, the Company reduced its tax liability by $1,633,000 with an offsetting decrease of $453,000 to opening accumulated deficit, and a decrease in
goodwill of $1,180,000. Additionally, in 2008, the Company decreased deferred tax assets and their associated valuation allowance by $12,749,000. The adoption resulted in a reclassification of certain tax liabilities from current to non-current. As
of December31, 2008, the Company has $33,554,000 of unrecognized tax benefits all of which would benefit the Companys tax expense if realized in the future. The following table summarizes the activity related to the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in thousands:  Balance at January1, 2009 33,554 Additions for tax positions in prior years 4,435 Decreases for tax positions in prior years 7,006 Current period unrecognized tax positions 4,038 Expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment of taxes Balance at December31, 2009 35,021 Additions for tax positions in prior years 310 Unrecognized tax benefits from acquisition of Microtune 868 Decreases for tax positions in prior years 424 Current period unrecognized tax positions 1,446 Expiration of the statute of limitations for assessment of taxes Balance at December31, 2010 37,221 The calculation of the Companys tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application
of complex tax regulations. The Company records liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. Actual tax liabilities may be different than the recorded estimates
and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined. The tax years 2006 through 2010 remain open to examination by the majority of taxing jurisdictions to which the
Company is subject to. In addition, the Company has federal and state credits and NOLs of which the statute of limitation is open from 1996. During 2007 the Company was contacted by the Israel Tax Authority ITA about an audit of the
Companys tax returns for 2005 through 2008 and, in 2009, the Company was contacted by the Franchise Tax Board of California for an audit of 2005 and 2006 tax years. It is probable that those audits will be settled during 2011 and the
Companys unrecognized tax benefits will be adjusted to reflect those settlements. The Company believes that over the next 12 months, as a result of settlement of these audits, it is reasonably possible that the Company will recognize
approximately

$20 million to $40 million of its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company continues to account for tax related interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision. At December31,
2010, accrued interest and penalties were immaterial. The Company has not provided for federal income tax on approximately
$96 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries since the Company intends to reinvest this amount outside the U.S. indefinitely. The tax impact of repatriating these earnings is not practical to compute. 
The Companys Israeli subsidiary has been granted the status of an Approved Enterprise pursuant to the Israeli Law for the
Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended. The Company has nine programs pursuant to this law; the first was approved in 1984 and the most recent began in 2007. Income subject to this program is exempt from Israeli tax for two, four, or
six years from the first year in which the Company has taxable income, net of NOLs, and is taxed at a rate of 10% for eight, six or four years thereafter. Benefits under the programs are granted for a period of ten years limited to the earlier of
fourteen years from application or twelve years from commencement of production. Benefits for the ninth program will expire in 2016. The tax benefit was $0, $0 and $09 million to the Companys net income in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
NOTE 12SEGMENT REPORTING The Companys products consist of highly integrated application-specific integrated circuits and system-on-a-chip solutions as well as licenses of certain software and other intellectual property.

Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the
Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December31, 2010. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in its reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely discussions regarding required disclosures. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: 1.
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
2.
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts
and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  3.
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on
our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation using criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December31, 2010. We acquired Microtune, Inc. in November 2010 and as permitted by SEC guidance, we
excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2010, the internal control over financial reporting of this entity. Net assets including goodwill and intangible assets
related to Microtune, Inc. of $1388 million as of December31, 2010, and net loss of $07 million for the period from the date of acquisition to December31, 2010, were included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the
year ended December31, 2010. 
87 Table of Contents
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2010 has been audited by Deloitte Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. Changes to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes
in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
