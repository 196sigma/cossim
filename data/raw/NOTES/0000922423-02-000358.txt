Item 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
Independent Auditors' Report
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Kroll Inc.
New York, New York     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Kroll
Inc. and subsidiaries the Company as of December 31, 2001 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for
the year then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. The consolidated
financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2000 and
1999 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated August 22, 2001,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such 2001 consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. Deloitte & Touche LLP

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Years Ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 1      Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
Kroll Inc., formerly known as The Kroll-O'Gara Company an Ohio
corporation, together with its subsidiaries collectively, Kroll, is a leading
global provider of a broad range of specialized services that are designed to
provide solutions to a variety of risk mitigation and security needs. Kroll
Investigations and Intelligence Group offers: 1 Consulting Services such as
business investigations and intelligence as well as financial services; 2
Security Services such as security and technology services; and 3 Employee
Screening Services including pre-employment background checking, drug testing
and surveillance services. The former Security Products and Services Group
SPSG marketed ballistic and blast protected vehicles and security services
see Note 5 for a discussion of the discontinuance of SPSG and the Voice and
Data Communications Group VDCG. The former Information Security Group offered
information and computer security services, including network and system
security review and repair see Note 6a for a discussion of the preferred
stock sale completed during fiscal 2000 by the Information Security Group
subsidiary.
The consolidated financial statements include the historical
consolidated financial statements of Kroll and the businesses it has acquired,
since their respective dates of acquisition, under the purchase method of
accounting and the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
entities, which were merged with Kroll in connection with pooling of interests
business combinations for all periods presented see Note 4.
2      Corporate Initiatives
Kroll has considered a variety of corporate initiatives within the
periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Mergers
and acquisitions are discussed in Note 4.
On November 15, 1999, Kroll announced that it had entered into a
definitive agreement with Blackstone Capital Partners III Merchant Banking Fund
L. P. Blackstone pursuant to which Blackstone would acquire shares held by all
Kroll shareholders, other than certain members of management, for $1800 per
share in cash. On April 12, 2000, Kroll announced that Blackstone had withdrawn
its offer to acquire Kroll shares. Costs associated with the failed merger were
approximately $16 million and $25 million for the years ended December 31,
1999 and 2000, respectively, and consisted primarily of fees for attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers, travel and other related charges.
On April 18, 2000, Kroll announced it would explore structuring a
transaction that would result in the separation of its two principal operating
segments, SPSG and the Investigations and Intelligence Group, and it would seek
an equity investment for its Information Security Group. In September 2000, the
Board of Directors Board approved an agreement and plan of reorganization and
dissolution of Kroll that would have resulted in the spinoff of net assets into
two new public companies. Had the spinoff been completed, Kroll shareholders,
other than members of management of the separated companies, would have owned
shares in both companies. On April 20, 2001, the Board decided not to pursue
this separation alternative. Costs associated with this proposed separation were
approximately $42 million and $06 million for the years ended December 31,
2000 and 2001, respectively, and consisted primarily of fees for attorneys,
accountants, investment bankers and other related charges. Kroll does not
anticipate any additional expenses related to this now terminated separation
alternative.
On April 20, 2001, in lieu of the proposed separation, the Board
approved a definitive agreement, subject to a limited number of closing
conditions, to sell most of the active companies that comprise SPSG to Armor
Holdings, Inc. Armor. On August 22, 2001, Kroll completed the sale of SPSG to
Armor for up to $557 million                    42 consisting of $372 million in cash, $150 million in Armor common stock, and
$15 million placed in escrow, pending agreement on the closing date balance
sheet audit. The purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment in the
event that the tangible net assets of SPSG as of the closing date are less than
approximately $350 million. Ultimate resolution of this adjustment is still
under review. The purchase and sale agreement also provides for a potential
deferred payment of up to $20 million by Armor to Kroll based on the
achievement of a gross profit target by SPSG for the year ended December 31,
2001 see Note 5a.
On March 30, 2001, Kroll entered into amended and restated agreements
for its revolving credit facility, letters of credit facility and its senior
notes, which agreements were further amended in April 2001. The agreements were
amended again on October 22, 2001, which extended the date of repayment of all
outstanding debt to November 16, 2001.
In November 2001, Kroll obtained new financing of $300 million in the
form of 6% Senior Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2006. On November
14, 2001, Kroll issued $250 million of notes and issued an additional $50
million of notes on November 20, 2001. The notes mature November 14, 2006 and
bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum payable semi-annually. However, 12%
per annum will accrue on any principal payment that is past due. Kroll may
redeem these convertible notes at par plus accrued interest in whole or in part
beginning November 14, 2004 provided the note holders have been notified in
writing 20 days in advance. The note holders may at any time prior to one day
before the earlier of the maturity date or the redemption date, convert all or a
portion of the principal amount of the notes into Kroll common stock at the
conversion price of $1080 per share. The $300 million of notes are immediately
convertible into 2,777,777 shares of Kroll common stock, subject to customary
and other anti-dilution adjustments. Barring early conversion by the noteholders
or early redemption by Kroll, the average additional non-cash interest expense
resulting from this discount amortization will be approximately $23 million or
76% per year on $300 million principal see Note 11.
3      Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions are eliminated. Investments in 20% to 50% owned entities are
accounted for on the equity method and investments in less than 20% owned
entities are accounted for on the cost method. Affiliated entities are not
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, and include
entities that are directly or indirectly owned by current shareholders or former
shareholders.
Kroll has adopted income statement recognition as its accounting policy
for recognizing any gains and losses on issuances of stock by its subsidiaries.
b Revenue Recognition--Revenue from intelligence and investigation
services is recognized as the services are performed pursuant to the applicable
contractual arrangements. Revenue related to time and materials arrangements is
recognized in the period in which the services are performed. Revenue from
standard hourly rate engagements is recognized as hours are incurred and revenue
from standard daily rate arrangements is recognized at amounts represented by
the agreed-upon billing amounts as incurred. Revenues related to fixed price
arrangements are recognized based upon costs incurred as a percentage of the
estimated total direct costs of the respective arrangements. The impact of any
revisions in estimated total revenues and direct contract costs is recognized in
the period in which they become known. Kroll records either billed or unbilled
accounts receivable based on case-by-case invoicing determinations.
Revenue from information security group services, which consisted of
consulting fees on information security projects, was recognized ratably over
the period of the agreement as services were performed or according to the
completed contract method of accounting for contract revenues, depending on the
nature of the agreement.
43     c Cash and Cash Equivalents--Cash equivalents consist of all highly
liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less at the date
of purchase. Kroll invests excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements, which
are government-collateralized securities. The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value of those instruments due to their short
maturity.
d Concentrations of Credit Risk--Financial instruments that subject
Kroll to credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. The number of
clients that comprise Kroll client base, along with the different industries
and geographic regions in which Kroll clients operate limits concentrations of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable. Kroll does not generally
require collateral or other security to support client receivables, although
Kroll does require retainers, up-front deposits or irrevocable letters-of-credit
in many situations. Kroll has established an allowance for doubtful accounts
based upon facts surrounding the credit risk of specific clients and past
history. Management does not anticipate incurring losses on its trade
receivables in excess of established allowances.
e Property, Plant and Equipment--Property, plant and equipment are
stated at cost. As of December 31, 2001, depreciation is computed utilizing the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as
follows Description                         Useful Life
-                          Buildings and    5-40 years
Leasehold   Life of lease
Furniture and    3-10 years
Machinery and    3-12 years
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $3,948,502, $5,468,460 and $6,266,322,
respectively.
f Databases--Databases are capitalized costs incurred in obtaining
information from third party providers. Kroll utilizes this information to
create and maintain its proprietary and non-proprietary databases. Because of
the continuing accessibility of the information and its usefulness to future
investigative procedures, the cost of acquiring the information is capitalized
and amortized over a five year period. Amortization of databases for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $3,520,624, $3,572,148 and
$4,009,731, respectively.
g Impairment of Long-Lived Assets--In June 2000, Kroll began to
develop a contact and relationship management CRM database software program.
Kroll had capitalized approximately $04 million in software and hardware costs
along with an additional $04 million in consulting and related costs to prepare
the database for its intended purpose. Kroll chose not to implement the CRM
software program in 2001 and charged impairment of assets for the accumulated
costs of approximately $08 million. No salvage value is considered to be
realizable.
Pursuant to the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, long-lived assets, certain
identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets must be reviewed
for impairment by asset group for which the lowest level of independent cash
flows can be identified. In accordance with this standard, Kroll periodically
reviews the carrying value of these assets by subsidiary acquired giving rise to
the goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. Impairments are
recognized when the expected undiscounted future cash flows, including eventual
disposition, are less than the carrying amount of the asset. Based on its most
recent analysis, Kroll believes no impairments exist at December 31, 2001,
except for impairments recognized during 2001 relating to the CRM software
program discussed above. It is possible, due to a change in circumstances, that
carrying values could become impaired in the future. Such impairments could have
a material
44 effect on the results of operations in a particular reporting period. Effective
January 1, 2002, Kroll will apply SFAS 142 relating to the evaluation of long
lived assets see Note 3n.
h Costs in Excess of Assets Acquired--Costs in excess of assets
acquired represents the excess of the purchase cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired in purchase business combinations. Costs in excess of assets
acquired, net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 were
approximately $53,647,000 and $50,436,000, respectively. Amortization is
recorded on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 12 to 40 years.
Amortization of costs in excess of assets acquired for the years ended December
31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately $2,524,000 $2,594,000 and $2,432,000,
respectively. Effective January 1, 2002, in compliance with SFAS No. 142, assets
with an indefinite life are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment
on at least an annual basis.
i Other Intangible Assets--Other intangible assets, comprised mainly
of customer lists and non-compete agreements, are amortized on a straight-line
basis. Customer lists are amortized over a fifteen year period and the
non-compete agreements are amortized over the lives of the respective
agreements, which range from six months to five years. Other intangible assets,
net of accumulated amortization, as of December 31, 2000 and 2001 were
approximately $7,386,000 and $6,720,000, respectively. Amortization of other
intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was
approximately $328,000, $533,000 and $883,000, respectively.
j Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions--Assets and
liabilities of foreign operations are translated using year-end exchange rates
and revenues and expenses are translated using exchange rates prevailing during
the year, with gains or losses resulting from translation included in a separate
component of shareholders' equity.
Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
translated to local currency at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of
the transactions. Amounts receivable or payable in foreign currencies, other
than the subsidiary local currency, are translated at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the balance sheet date. The effect of transactional gains or
losses is included in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.
k Use of Estimates--The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.
l Advertising--Kroll expenses the cost of advertising as incurred.
Advertising expense for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was
approximately $651,000, $1,199,000 and $433,000, respectively.
m Earnings Per Share--Pursuant to the provisions of SFAS No. 128
Earnings Per Share basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing
net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and
common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. Dilutive common stock
equivalents represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and
warrants and assumed issuance of restricted stock.                    45     The following is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for
basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000

As a result of the net loss recorded in 1999, 2000 and 2001, basic and
diluted loss per share are identical as all options and warrants are
anti-dilutive.
At December 31, 1999, 8,719 warrants and 597,155 options to purchase an
equivalent amount of shares of common stock of Kroll at $2569 per warrant and
from $2694 to $3488 per option were outstanding but were not included in the
shares in the above tables because the warrants' and options' exercise prices
were greater than the average market price of the common shares.
At December 31, 2000, 9,661 warrants and 1,304,866 options to purchase
an equivalent amount of shares of common stock of Kroll at $1301 to $2569 per
warrant and from $900 to $2854 per option were outstanding but were not
included in the shares in the above tables because the warrants' and options'
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares.
At December 31, 2001, 9,526 warrants and 707,439 options to purchase an
equivalent amount of shares of common stock of Kroll at $1952 to $2569 per
warrant and from $900 to $3075 per option were outstanding but were not
included in the shares in the above tables because the warrants' and options'
exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares.
n New Accounting Pronouncements--In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations SFAS No. 141, which addresses financial
accounting and reporting for business combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires all
business combinations in the scope of the statement to be accounted for using
one method, the purchase method. The provisions of this statement apply to all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets SFAS No. 142, which established accounting and reporting
standards for goodwill and other intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets. The provisions of this statement
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Due to the
issuance of the standard, Kroll will not amortize goodwill in future periods
see Note 3h for prior year amortization.
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations SFAS No. 143, which addresses financial accounting and
reporting for obligations and costs associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. Kroll is required to implement SFAS No. 143 on January 1,
2003, and has not yet determined the impact that this statement will have on its
results of operations or financial position.
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets SFAS No. 144, which replaces SFAS
No. 121 Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed of and establishes accounting and reporting standards for
long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale. This standard applies to all
long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. SFAS No. 144 requires that
those assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost
to sell. SFAS No. 144 also broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to
include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished
from the rest of the entity that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations
of the entity in a disposal transaction. Kroll is required to implement SFAS No.
144 on
47 January 1, 2002, and currently believes there will be no material impact related
to the implementation of this statement on its results of operations or
financial position.
In March 2000, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 44 Interpretation No. 44, Accounting for Certain
Transactions involving Stock Compensation - an interpretation of APB Opinion
25. Interpretation No. 44 became effective July 1, 2000. Interpretation No. 44
clarifies the application of APB Opinion 25 for certain matters, specifically
a the definition of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion 25, b
the criteria for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan,
c the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a
previously fixed stock option or award, and d the accounting for an exchange
of stock compensation awards in a business combination. See Note 6a for a
discussion of the impact of Interpretation No. 44 related to certain stock
option awards held by the employees of a former subsidiary.
In September 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF announced Issue
No. 00-20, Accounting for Costs Incurred to Acquire or Originate Information
for Database Content and Other Collections of Information, stating that the
EITF is considering different views for the accounting for database costs. One
of the views would require Kroll to expense some or all of the database costs
that Kroll currently capitalizes and amortizes, which is currently an acceptable
alternative. Adoption of a different method of accounting for database costs
could have a material impact on Kroll financial position and results of
operations. To date, the EITF has not made any official determinations on this
issue.
o Stock-Based Compensation--Kroll has elected to account for the cost
of its employee stock options and other forms of employee stock-based
compensation plans utilizing the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB Opinion 25 as allowed by SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123. APB Opinion 25 requires
compensation cost for stock-based compensation plans to be recognized based on
the difference, if any, between the fair market value of the stock on the date
of grant and the option exercise price. SFAS 123 established a fair value-based
method of accounting for compensation cost related to stock options and other
forms of stock-based compensation plans. SFAS 123 allows an entity to continue
to measure compensation cost using the principles of APB Opinion 25 if certain
pro forma disclosures are made. The pro forma disclosures required by SFAS 123
are presented in Note 14d.
p Derivative Financial Instruments--Financial instruments in the form
of foreign currency exchange contracts were utilized by Kroll to hedge its
exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Kroll does not hold or
issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. In November 2001,
Kroll sold its four remaining foreign currency hedge contracts. When terminated,
the contracts had a notional amount of $32 million, which approximated their
fair value. At December 31, 2001, Kroll had no foreign currency exchange
contracts in place.
4      Mergers and Acquisitions
Kroll has completed numerous business combinations in the periods
presented. The transactions were accounted for as both purchase business
combinations and pooling of interests business combinations as follows     a Pooling of Interests Transactions--In March 1999, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Kroll acquired each then issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Financial Research, Inc. FRI. Effective upon the consummation of the
transaction a total of 101,555 shares of Kroll common stock were issued. The
transaction constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for as
a pooling of interests. The prior period consolidated financial statements would
not be materially different from the reported results and accordingly have not
been restated.
In June 1999, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kroll was merged with and
into Background America, Inc. BAI. Effective upon the consummation of the
merger, each then issued and outstanding share of BAI common
48 and preferred stock was converted into 02689628 shares of common stock of Kroll
or 899,243 shares of Kroll common stock in total. Outstanding stock options
and stock warrants of BAI were converted at the same exchange factor into
options to purchase 86,844 and 2,018 shares, respectively, of Kroll common
stock see Note 14.
The merger with BAI constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been
accounted for as a pooling of interests. Accordingly, all prior period
consolidated financial statements presented have been restated to include the
combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows of BAI as
though it had always been a part of Kroll and are reported in the Employee
Screening Services Segment.
There were no transactions between Kroll and BAI prior to the
combination. Immaterial adjustments were recorded to conform the accounting
practices of Kroll and BAI and certain reclassifications were made to the BAI
financial statements to conform to Kroll presentation.                         Kroll      BAI    Adjustments   Combined

Net    2,418,425    109,930      --   2,528,355     In 1999, Kroll recorded a charge to operating expenses of approximately
$41 million $32 million after taxes, or $014 per diluted share for direct
and other merger and integration related costs. Merger transaction costs include
$03 million for stay bonuses, $04 million for stock-based compensation costs
triggered by the change in control of BAI and $24 million which consisted
primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial
printing, travel and other related charges. Integration costs relate primarily
to the mergers and acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 1998 and were
approximately $10 million.
In 2000, Kroll recorded a charge to operating expenses of approximately
$04 million $002 per diluted share for merger integration related costs.
These costs relate primarily to mergers and acquisitions completed in 1999.
b Purchase Transactions--In addition to the mergers during 1999 with
BAI and FRI, Kroll completed an additional acquisition in 1999, which was
accounted for as a purchase business combination. In June 1999, Kroll completed
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of The
Buchler Phillips Group BP. BP provides financial recovery, restructuring,
insolvency and turnaround services throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. The
purchase price amounted to approximately $200 million and consisted of
approximately $120 million in cash and 366,469 shares of Kroll common stock
valued at approximately $80 million or an average of $2186 per share. For
accounting purposes, the acquisition was effective on April 1, 1999 and the
results of operations of BP are included in the consolidated results of
operations, within the Consulting Services Segment of Kroll from that date
forward. The resulting goodwill from this acquisition is being amortized over 25
years.
During 2000, Kroll completed two acquisitions, which were accounted for
as purchase business combinations. The aggregate purchase price of these
acquisitions amounted to approximately $13 million and consisted of $07
million in cash and notes payable of $06 million to the former owners of the
businesses. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in
the consolidated financial statements from the respective effective dates of
acquisition. The resulting goodwill from these transactions is being amortized
over 25 years.
49     Effective January 1, 2002, goodwill relating to the above purchase
acquisitions will no longer be amortized pursuant to SFAS No. 142.
In connection with the purchase acquisitions, assets were acquired and
liabilities were assumed as follows                                       Years ended December 31,

5      Discontinued Operations
a Security Products and Services Group--On April 20, 2001, the Board
approved a definitive agreement to sell the common stock of most of the active
companies that comprise SPSG to Armor. The results of operations have been
classified as discontinued and all prior periods have been restated accordingly.
The results of the discontinued SPSG reflect an allocation of Kroll
administrative costs attributable to SPSG and, to the extent that such
identification was not practicable, on the basis of SPSG sales as a percentage
of Kroll sales. The results of the discontinued SPSG also reflect an
allocation of corporate interest expense based on Kroll weighted average
interest rate applied to intercompany advances. The sale did not include the
subsidiaries that provide kidnap and ransom and risk information services, which
Kroll continues to operate. Also excluded from the sale was the Russian business
although it was included in SPSG discontinued operations, as further described
below.
On August 22, 2001, Kroll completed the sale of SPSG to Armor for up to
$557 million, consisting of $372 million in cash, $150 million in common
stock, and an additional $15 million placed in escrow, pending agreement on the
closing date balance sheet audit. The purchase and sale agreement also provides
for a potential deferred payment of up to $20 million by Armor to Kroll based
on the achievement of a gross profit target by SPSG for the year ended December
31, 2001.
The purchase price is subject to a dollar for dollar adjustment to the
extent that tangible net assets are less than $350 million as of the closing
date, as reflected in an agreed upon closing date balance sheet. The closing
date balance sheet has not been finalized and various adjustments are still
subject to review between
50 Kroll and Armor. The $15 million in escrow has not currently been included in
determining the estimated loss on the sale of SPSG. Similarly, Kroll has not
included any impact of the potential $20 million deferred payment by Armor to
Kroll in determining the estimated loss on the sale of SPSG.
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Kroll recorded a loss of
approximately $03 million on the sale of the discontinued SPSG. Additionally,
as a result of the reversal of foreign currency translation, an increase of $41
million was recorded in equity for the gain in accumulated other comprehensive
loss, net of tax. As a result, the net increase to equity for the disposal of
SPSG was approximately $38 million.
Although Kroll Russian business was not sold to Armor, the Russian
business was part of the plan to discontinue SPSG and, therefore, has been
included in discontinued operations of SPSG. Kroll anticipates selling this
business by May 22, 2002, and does not anticipate any material gain or loss on
this future sale. If Kroll does not sell the business of this subsidiary, or
otherwise terminate this business, by May 22, 2002, Kroll has a $01 million
liability payable to Armor for each 90-day period of non-compliance subsequent
to May 22, 2002.

Institute of Certified Public Accountants released Statement of Position
SOP 98-5 Reporting on the Cost of Start-Up Activities. The SOP
requires costs of start-up activities, including preoperating costs,
organization costs and other start-up costs, to be expensed as incurred.
The former practice of Kroll discontinued SPSG operation was to
capitalize certain of these expenses and amortize them over periods
ranging from one to five years. Kroll discontinued SPSG operation
adopted the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of fiscal
1999 and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of $08 million, net of a tax benefit of $04 million.
ii Related Party Transactions

b Voice and Data Communications Group--On April 16, 2001, the Board of
Directors approved a formal plan to discontinue operations of VDCG, which
offered secure satellite communication equipment and satellite navigation
systems. Kroll has divested itself of the operations of this segment.
The results of operations of VDCG have been classified as discontinued
operations and all prior periods have been restated accordingly. The results of
VDCG reflect an allocation of interest expense based on VDCG average net
assets. The tax effects of the results of operations of VDCG were not
significant for the periods presented.
The fiscal 2000 estimated loss on disposal of $50 million $023 per
diluted share includes the estimated future results of operations through the
date of sale. Major components of the estimated loss on disposal include a
writedown of related goodwill and other asset balances of $42 million and
estimated severance, operating and shutdown costs of $08 million. The loss on
disposal calculation includes $02 million of allocated interest expense.
On June 27, 2001, Kroll sold its ownership in the stock of VDCG to an
unrelated third party for notes that are due and payable in 2004 with a
contingent value of up to $40 million. Originally Kroll valued these notes at
$18 million because the realization of the full value of these notes is
contingent upon certain factors, including the subsequent sale of VDCG by the
purchaser. Since this valuation approximated the net assets of VDCG at the date
of the sale, no gain or loss was recognized. In November 2001, Kroll
re-evaluated the collectibility of the notes and determined that the ultimate
resale of VDCG and collection on the notes was uncertain. As a result, the notes
were written down to zero and an additional $20 million loss on the sale of
VDCG was recorded in 2001.                    53     Net sales, results of operations and net assets from this discontinued
operation are as follows                                 Years Ended December 31,  Period Ended

6      Sale of Subsidiaries
a Sale of Stock by Information Security Group--In October 2000,
Kroll then wholly owned subsidiary, Securify Inc. Securify, completed the
sale of preferred stock shares through a private equity offering to certain
unrelated third parties. Under the terms of the stock purchase agreement,
Securify issued approximately 492 million shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, valued at $068 per share for total gross proceeds of
approximately $335 million. These preferred shares are convertible into an
equivalent number of shares of Securify common stock. Kroll recognized a
pre-tax gain on this transaction of approximately $16 million. The tax effects
of this transaction approximate $21 million, resulting in a total, net of tax,
loss of $05 million. The tax effects of this transaction include net operating
loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets that will not remain with
Kroll. As of December 31, 2001, Kroll had an amount receivable from Securify,
totaling approximately $54 million, which was fully reserved, that is subject
to an unsecured promissory note agreement with repayment terms scheduled over a
five-year period. Kroll will recognize income in the period that repayments are
received pursuant to the promissory note agreement.
As a result of this transaction, as of December 31, 2000, Kroll voting
control in Securify approximated 27 percent. The investment in Securify,
previously consolidated, is now accounted for using the equity method. Kroll
does not have any carrying value for its investment as of December 31, 2001.
Securify has realized continuing losses since October 2000. Since Kroll has not
provided any guarantees and is not committed to provide any future funding to
Securify, it has not recorded its equity share of Securify losses.
In January 2002, in connection with Securify obtaining additional
financing from its preferred stockholders, Kroll agreed with Securify to
restructure its existing debt of approximately $54 million. In return for an
agreement to forgive a portion of this debt, Kroll received 1 a promissory
note for $500,000 accruing interest at 95% per annum and matures on December 1,
2004, 2 a promissory note for $500,000 that matures at the earlier of a the
date on which Securify completes its next financing, or b October 17, 2005 and
accrues interest beginning on July 11, 2002 at 95% per annum, 3 a promissory
note for $25 million that matures on October 17, 2005 but, on the date on which
Securify completes its next financing, will convert into new securities of the
type issued by Securify in its financing with a value of $25 million, and
accrues interest beginning on July 11, 2002 at 95% per annum and 4 58,666
shares of Class B common stock of Securify. Also in connection
54 with the restructuring of debt, Kroll received a non-exclusive license to use
proprietary software developed by Securify.
b Sale of Decision Resources, Inc.--On September 10, 2001, Kroll sold
Decision Resources, Inc. to the former owner. As payment, Kroll was forgiven
$02 million on the unpaid portion of notes payable to the former owner and is
due from the purchaser a payment of approximately $01 million, which is
included in prepaid expenses and other current assets. The notes payable that
were forgiven were the unpaid portion of the original purchase price. The
balance of the purchase price is subject to a pending valuation process. Kroll
recognized a provisional loss, subject to the valuation process, on the sale of
its business unit of approximately $05 million, which was recorded in the year
ended December 31, 2001.
7      Balance Sheet Accounts
a Trade Accounts Receivable--Kroll had billed trade receivables in the

d Restructuring of Operations--In the first quarter of 1999, Kroll
began implementation of a restructuring plan the 1999 Plan to reduce costs and
improve operating efficiencies. The 1999 Plan was substantially completed by the
end of the second quarter of 1999. The total pre-tax restructuring charge
recorded pursuant to the 1999 Plan was approximately $41 million. Total
payments or writeoffs made pursuant to the 1999 Plan through December 31, 2001
were $39 million. Kroll does not expect to incur any other significant
restructuring charges in future periods related to the 1999 Plan. The principal
elements of the restructuring plan were the closure of two Investigations and
Intelligence Group offices and the elimination of approximately 82 employees.

2000 and 2001, respectively, most of which, at December 31, 2000, relate to
discontinued SPSG operations in Mexico and the Philippines. The foreign net
operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2001 relate primarily to Kroll
continuing operations in Asia. The domestic carryforwards expire beginning in
2020. A valuation allowance for all existing domestic and foreign loss
58 carryforwards has been provided, as it is not certain that the tax benefit will
be realized in the foreseeable future. Adjustments to the valuation allowance,
if any, will be recorded in the periods in which it is determined the asset is
more likely than not to be realized.

and 2001, the continuing operations of Kroll rendered services to American
International Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries AIG which is also a shareholder
of Kroll. Total revenue recognized for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000
and 2001 was $4,779,449, $5,776,344 and $5,120,559, respectively. Additionally,
AIG provides certain services to the continuing operations of Kroll, which have
been included in cost of sales and operating expenses in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. These costs were approximately $270,970 286,589 and $386,058 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The year-end accounts receivable balance from AIG was
approximately $1,231,685, $1,465,474 and $1,921,930 at December 31, 1999, 2000
and 2001, respectively.
c Building and Equipment Leases--Affiliated Entities--Effective June
1, 1998, Kroll reached an agreement to terminate the corporate aircraft lease
which originated in February 1995 with an affiliated entity. The terms of the
aircraft lease addendum provide Kroll with a future hourly discount from the
normal commercial hourly rate in order to amortize the remaining portion of
existing lease deposits from the original aircraft lease. Rental expense,
including amortization recognized, approximated $82,000, $90,000 and $90,000 for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. As of December
31, 2000 and 2001, Kroll had $312,929 and $223,057, respectively in unamortized
lease deposits with this affiliated entity.
Kroll is also currently leasing various equipment and office space from
several affiliated entities under various five year and month-to-month lease
agreements. Rental expense, net of sub-lease income, approximated $227,000 246,000 and $465,000 for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively.
d During 1999, 2000 and 2001, an officer of Kroll agreed to reimburse
Kroll for a portion of general and administrative expenses, including outside
professional fees, office rent and travel expenses, which were incurred on his
behalf. Amounts due to Kroll at December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 pursuant to
this agreement were $281,561, $651,000 and $494,935, respectively. Subsequently,
the officer reimbursed $250,000 to Kroll.
59 10      Revolving Lines of Credit
On March 30, 2001, Kroll entered into an amended and restated loan
agreement to provide for a revolving credit facility that initially amounted to
$400 million. The loan agreement was further amended on April 20, 2001.
Additionally, the loan agreement provided for up to $60 million of
transactional letters of credit. The loan agreement was secured by substantially
all assets of Kroll and its subsidiaries, and a pledge of the stock of
essentially all the subsidiaries, all of which jointly and severally guaranteed
obligations under the agreement. The security pledge and joint and several
guarantee also extended to the $350 million senior notes. Based on the
amendments on March 30, 2001 and April 20, 2001, advances under the revolving
credit facility bear interest at the greater of a 856% or b the prime rate
plus 15%, plus 05% times the number of 30-day periods which have expired since
April 20, 2001 or, if less, the highest rate allowed by law. Kroll used 5679%
of the proceeds from the sale of SPSG including the subsequent conversion of
Armor stock to cash, to pay down this line of credit by approximately $282
million in 2001.
The amended agreement required the net proceeds from any lender approved
asset sales in excess of $10 million per transaction or $20 million per fiscal
year to be paid proportionately to the lender and the holders of the senior
notes, with a corresponding reduction in the total permitted borrowings under
the revolving credit facility. A material adverse change in the business of
Kroll, including a significant sale of net assets, would result in the
acceleration of all amounts due to the lender and the holders of the senior
notes. In accordance with the April 20, 2001 amendment to the loan agreement,
Kroll agreement to sell the entities that comprise the Security Products and
Services Group discussed in Note 5a resulted in an acceleration of all amounts
due under the loan agreement 60 days after the closing of the sale, resulting in
the expiration of the agreement on October 22, 2001, which was then extended to
November 16, 2001. All amounts outstanding under this agreement were repaid on
November 14, 2001, thus terminating the agreement.
This loan agreement included financial covenants which, among other
restrictions, require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and other
financial requirements, including an interest coverage ratio, net worth minimums
and minimum quarterly EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, that required Kroll to effectively break even before taxes and to
generate EBITDA of $60 million per quarter. The loan agreement also imposed
limitations on mergers, acquisitions, stock redemptions, additional indebtedness
and capital expenditures. The loan agreement did not permit the declaration or
payment of any dividends, other than stock dividends.
Anticipating the sale of SPSG, Kroll endeavored to obtain financing of
approximately $450 million at rates comparable to the original unamended bank
loan. Subsequent negotiations did not lead to a financing agreement acceptable
to the Company as of December 31, 2001. As a result, pursuit of this alternative
was terminated. Kroll direct expense of $10 million, including commitment and
due diligence fees and the cost of extending the current amended bank loan has
been written off as failed financing costs in the year ended December 31, 2001.
Average borrowings under the revolving credit facility and its
predecessors were $10,838,273, $29,885,224 and $ 23,094,716 during 1999, 2000
and 2001, respectively, at approximate weighted average interest rates of 702 850% and 927%, respectively. The maximum borrowings outstanding during 1999,
2000 and 2001 were $22,822,706, $38,442,798 and $ 37,996,679 respectively.
Borrowings under the revolving credit facility were approximately $365 million
at December 31, 2000. The facility was retired November 14, 2001 see Note 20.
Effective June 3, 1999, with the acquisition of Buchler Phillips, Kroll
acquired a demand note with maximum borrowings of pound25 million. The demand
note bears interest at the Bank of England base rate plus 10%. Average
borrowings during 2000 and 2001 under the demand note were $2,178,761 and
$2,573,786, as translated, at an approximate weighted average interest rate of
713% and 679%. The maximum borrowings outstanding during 2000 and 2001 were
$3,547,638 and $4,525,496, respectively, as translated. Maximum
60 borrowings permitted pursuant to this demand note are $36 million based on an
exchange rate of 069 British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar. Borrowings
outstanding pursuant to this demand note were approximately $28 million and
$26 million, as translated at December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Senior Notes
Kroll $350 million of senior notes were amended on March 30, 2001 and
April 20, 2001. Based on the amendments, the senior notes bore interest at the
greater of a 856% or b the prime rate plus 15%, plus 05% times the number
of 30-day periods which have expired since April 20, 2001 or, if less, the
highest rate allowed by law. The senior notes also contained financial
covenants, which among other restrictions required the maintenance of a minimum
level of net worth and a fixed charge coverage ratio. The senior notes were
cross-collateralized and guaranteed with the Company revolving credit facility
and contained similar acceleration provisions that required the net proceeds
from asset sales to be paid proportionately to the revolving credit facility
lender and the holders of the senior notes. In accordance with the April 20,
2001 amendment to the senior notes, Kroll sale of the entities that comprised
the Security Products and Services Group on August 22, 2001 see Note 5a
resulted in the acceleration of all amounts due under the revolving credit
facility and the senior notes to a date 60 days after the closing of the sale.
Kroll obtained from the lender an extension from October 22, 2001 to November
16, 2001. Kroll used 4321% of the proceeds from the sale of SPSG to repay these
notes by approximately $212 million during the third quarter of 2001. On
November 14, 2001, all outstanding debt under the senior notes was repaid, with
no adverse consequences resulting from any event of non-compliance.
Senior Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes
In November 2001, Kroll obtained new financing of $300 million in the
form of 6% Senior Secured Subordinated Convertible Notes due 2006. On November
14, 2001, Kroll issued $250 million of notes and issued an additional $50
million of notes on November 20, 2001. The notes mature November 14, 2006 and
bear
61 interest at the rate of 6% per annum payable semi-annually. However, 12% per
annum will accrue on any principal payment that is past due. Kroll may redeem
these convertible notes at par plus accrued interest in whole or in part
beginning November 14, 2004 provided the note holders have been notified in
writing 20 days in advance. The note holders may at any time prior to one day
before the earlier of the maturity date or the redemption date, convert all or a
portion of the principal amount of the notes into Kroll common stock at the
conversion price of $1080 per share. The $300 million of notes are immediately
convertible into 2,777,777 shares of Kroll common stock, subject to customary
and other anti-dilution adjustments.
The notes are secured by the same assets of Kroll and its material
subsidiaries and the same pledge of stock of certain of Kroll subsidiaries as
the credit facility, except that the notes are subordinate to the security
interest and rights of the credit facility lender.
The notes contain certain customary covenants, including covenants that
prohibit Kroll from disposing of any material subsidiary, incurring or
permitting to exist any debt other than the $150 million credit facility,
guaranteeing the obligations of any third party, creating or permitting to exist
any material liens on assets of material subsidiaries or entering into a
transaction prior to November 14, 2003 that involves a change in control of
Kroll as defined in the notes. The notes are payable upon any change in
control of Kroll at the option of the holders.
Kroll has an effective registration statement with the SEC covering the
resale of the notes, and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
these notes, and is required to keep the registration statement effective for at
least two years.
The note holders may designate an observer to the Board of Directors who
may serve in this capacity as long as 20% of the notes, or shares into which the
notes were converted, are held by the noteholders or investors. The observer may
also attend Audit and Compensation Committee meetings.
In connection with the issuance of the notes Kroll recorded a notes
discount of approximately $114 million based on the difference between the
closing price of its stock on the issuance date and the conversion price. In
addition to the stated 6% interest, the discount will be amortized as non-cash
interest expense over the expected 5-year life of the notes. Barring early
conversion by the noteholders or early redemption by Kroll, the average
additional non-cash interest expense resulting from this discount amortization
will be approximately $23 million or 76% per year on $300 million principal.
A significant portion of the proceeds from the new financing was used to
retire Kroll amended bank loan and senior notes. The deferred financing costs

13      Defined Contribution and Bonus Plans
As of December 31, 2001, Kroll had the following employee benefit plans
in place     a Defined Contribution Plans--Kroll and its subsidiaries have
established various non-contributory profit sharing/401k plans covering
substantially all of Kroll employees. Contributions to the plans are
discretionary and are determined annually by Kroll Board of Directors. Certain
plans also offer a matching contribution whereby Kroll will contribute a
percentage of the amount a participant contributes, limited to certain maximum
amounts. Plan contribution expense charged against current operations for all
such plans amounted to approximately $954,000, $977,000 and $1,167,000 for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
b Profit and Revenue Sharing Plans--Kroll and its subsidiaries have
established various profit and revenue sharing plans covering substantially all
of Kroll employees. The plans were established to provide employees an annual
cash incentive bonus based on various operating and non-operating criteria.
Kroll may
63 amend, modify or terminate these plans at any time. Kroll expensed approximately
$1,235,000, $1,092,000 and $3,835,000 associated with the profit and revenue
sharing plans in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.
14      Equity Arrangements
The following equity arrangements include all obligations and rights of
Kroll, including those that pertain to employees, division, units and
subsidiaries that are accounted for as discontinued operations.
a Stock Option Plans--In 1996, Kroll adopted a stock option plan the
1996 Plan for employees, non-employee directors and consultants. Kroll may
grant options for up to 1,757,000 shares under the 1996 Plan. Options for
647,195, 262,374 and 155,000 shares were granted during 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The options generally vest in three equal annual installments over
the three years following the date of grant. Options granted under the plan are
generally granted at fair market value at the date of grant and are exercisable
over periods not exceeding ten years.
In connection with stock options granted by Securify during the year
ended December 31, 1998, Kroll recorded deferred compensation of $1,192,096,
representing the difference between the deemed value of the common stock for
accounting purposes and the option exercise price of such options at the date of
grant. This amount is presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity and will
be amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the applicable options.
Approximately $298,000 and $236,000 was expensed in the years ended 1999 and
2000, respectively. The unamortized balance of the deferred compensation
relating to these stock options was reversed to shareholders' equity upon the
sale of Securify in October 2000.
In 2000, Kroll adopted a stock option plan the 2000 Option Plan for
non-officer employees. Kroll may grant options for up to 750,000 shares under
the 2000 Option Plan. In May 2001 the 2000 Option Plan was amended to increase
by 2,250,000 the number of options that could be granted to a total of
3,000,000. Options for 742,400 and 2,027,000 shares were granted during the
years ended 2000 and 2001, respectively. Options under the 2000 Option Plan are
generally granted at fair market value at the date of grant and are exercisable
over periods not exceeding ten years. The options vest according to a formula
determined by the Board of Directors on the date of the grant.
In 2001, Kroll adopted a stock option plan the 2001 Option Plan for
non-employee directors. Kroll may grant options for up to 200,000 shares under
the 2001 Option Plan. Options for 10,000 shares were granted to each of the four
non-employee directors following Kroll annual meeting of shareholders on
August 16, 2001. Options under the 2001 Option Plan are generally granted at
fair market value at the date of grant and are exercisable over periods not
exceeding ten years. The options vest in three equal annual installments over
the three years following the date of grant.
At December 31, 2001, there were approximately 619,000, 231,000 and
160,000 authorized shares remaining for grant in the 1996 Plan, the 2000 Option
Plan and the 2001 Option Plan, respectively.
b Restricted Stock Plan--Effective August 12, 1998, Kroll adopted a
stock incentive plan the Stock Incentive Plan for employees. Kroll may grant
up to 500,000 shares under the Stock Incentive Plan. During fiscal 1999, 47,500
shares were granted under the plan, however there were no shares granted under
the plan during 2000 or 2001. In connection with the shares granted under the
Stock Incentive Plan in 1999, Kroll recorded deferred compensation of
$1,571,661, representing the difference between the fair market value of Kroll
common stock on the date of grant and the purchase price of the shares. This
amount is presented as a reduction of shareholders' equity and will be amortized
ratably over the vesting periods of the applicable grants. Approximately
$758,000, $364,000 and $337,000 were expensed in 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The deferred compensation was reduced in 2000 by approximately
$113,000 applicable to options forfeited by employees terminated in 2000. The
restricted stock grants vest ratably over three years.
At December 31, 2001, there were approximately 453,000 authorized shares
remaining for grant in the Stock Incentive Plan.
c Common Stock Warrants--As of December 31, 2001, warrants originally
granted by Laboratory Specialists of America, Inc. to purchase 8,719 shares of
common stock at $2569 per share were outstanding. These warrants were issued in
June 1998 to certain consultants and underwriters in connection with the                    64 completion of a private offering of common stock in 1998 and were recognized as
compensation paid for services rendered and treated as a reduction in the
recognized net proceeds from the offering.
As of December 31, 2001, warrants originally granted by BAI to purchase
807 shares of common stock at $1952 per share were outstanding. These warrants
were issued in June and July of 1996 and January of 1998 to certain consultants
and other non-employees with exercise prices equal to or greater than the then
fair value of BAI common stock on those dates.
As of December 31, 2001, Kroll had a total of 9,526 warrants still
outstanding.
d Stock Based Compensation Disclosure--SFAS 123 requires, at a
minimum, pro forma disclosures of expense for stock-based awards based on their
fair values. Had compensation cost for these plans been determined consistent
with SFAS 123, Kroll net loss and basic and diluted loss per share would have
been as follows                                   Years Ended December 31,

15      Commitments and Contingencies
a Letters of Credit--In connection with the sale of SPSG, Kroll
provided a $15 million standby letter of credit in favor of Armor to cover
certain potential foreign tax liabilities of SPSG. This letter of credit is
personally guaranteed by an officer and shareholder of Kroll.
b Employment Agreements--Kroll has employment agreements with its
executive officers and management level personnel with annual compensation
ranging in value up to $450,000, over varying periods extending to April 2005.
The agreements generally provide for salary continuation in the event of
termination without cause for the greater of the remainder of the agreement or
one year. The agreements also contain certain non-competition clauses and
generally provide for one year salary if the agreement is not renewed.
As of December 31, 2001, the remaining aggregate commitment under these
employment agreements if all individuals were terminated without cause was
approximately $114 million.
c Legal Matters--Kroll has been named as a defendant in eight lawsuits
alleging that its officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties in
connection with the now terminated proposed acquisition of a majority of Kroll
shares by a company formed by Blackstone Capital Partners III Merchant Banking
Fund L.P. Five of the lawsuits were filed in the Court of Common Pleas, Butler
County, Ohio, and were consolidated on November 29, 1999. The remaining three
lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and were consolidated on November 30, 1999. The plaintiffs
allege that Kroll officers and directors breached their fiduciary duties by
deferring acquisitions, by negotiating an inadequate acquisition price, by
failing to engage in arms-length negotiations and by failing to seek redress
from Blackstone after Blackstone terminated the proposed transaction. The
plaintiffs also allege that Blackstone and AIG aided and abetted the directors'
and officers' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs seek to bring
their claims derivatively on behalf of Kroll and also seek class certification.
The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duty and seek damages and attorneys' fees in an unspecified amount.
Kroll believes that the allegations in the complaint are meritless and will
defend the suits vigorously.
In 1999, Kroll learned that an individual had filed a qui tam suit
against Kroll under the Civil False Claims Act alleging that Kroll and three of
its vendors knowingly violated their contractual requirements with the Army due
to the vendors' alleged failure to have certified welders. In October 2000,
Kroll settled this litigation with the Department of Justice for approximately
$11 million, plus legal costs. Kroll admitted no wrongdoing as
66 part of the settlement. All amounts under this settlement were paid before
December 31, 2001. The qui tam suit and the corresponding settlement related
entirely to the discontinued SPSG operation.
Kroll Lindquist Avey Co. formerly Lindquist Avey Macdonald &
Baskerville LAMB, a subsidiary of Kroll, and several of its principals have
been named as third-party defendants in a lawsuit filed in the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice by HSBC Securities Canada Inc., formerly Gordon Capital, an
investment dealer HSBC. HSBC filed the underlying suit against Gordon
Capital former law firm, Davies, Ward & Beck, seeking damages in the amount of
approximately $40,000,000 Cdn. HSBC alleges DW negligently advised Gordon
Capital during 1991 through 1993 with respect to its rights concerning trading
losses and irregularities by a client account manager and various insurance
bonds relating to such losses and irregularities. HSBC further alleges various
suits and declaratory judgment actions involving the insurers were filed in 1993
and that summary judgment granted in favor of the insurers in 1996 was affirmed
on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the basis that the limitation period
under the bonds had expired without an action being commenced for recovery of
Gordon Capital losses. Gordon Capital, DW and LAMB entered into various
tolling agreements until the matters pending with the insurers were exhausted.
In April 2000, HSBC filed suit against DW In July 2001, DW filed a
third-party claim against LAMB and certain principals for contribution and
indemnity. An amended third-party claim was filed in September 2001. The
third-party claim alleges DW retained LAMB in June 1991 to examine the trading
irregularities and to advise Gordon Capital in respect of its dealings with its
insurers and that LAMB acted negligently in carrying out these services. Third
party claims have also been filed against some entities formerly known as Peat
Marwick Thorne, Gordon Capital alleged former auditors and AON Reed Stenhouse,
Inc., Gordon Capital alleged former insurance broker. While this matter is at
a preliminary stage and no response has yet been filed to the third-party claim
against LAMB and no discovery has been conducted, LAMB and its principals
believe that they have meritorious defenses to the claims and intend to defend
them vigorously.
In addition to the matters discussed above, Kroll is involved in
litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of its business; however,
Kroll does not believe that there is any currently pending litigation,
individually or in the aggregate, that is likely to have a material adverse
effect on its financial position, results of operations or its cash flows.
16      Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The fair value of long-term debt approximates its historical carrying
amount. Cash equivalents, other current assets and current liabilities are
reflected in the financial statements at cost, which approximates fair value due
to the short-term nature of these items.
17     Customer and Segment Data
a Segment Data--Through October 17, 2000, Kroll operated in three
business segments, the Security Products and Services Group, the Investigations
and Intelligence Group and the Information Security Group. As a result of the
preferred stock sale completed by the Information Security Group on October 17,
2000, the Group ceased to be a part of the consolidated results of Kroll from
that date forward. See Note 6a for more information on this transaction.
As a result of the sale of SPSG to Armor on August 22, 2001 see Note
5a, SPSG was accounted for as a discontinued operation and all prior periods
have been restated accordingly in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. The segment data in the table below depicts the Investigations and
Intelligence Group in three business segments; Consulting Services, Security
Services and Employee Screening Services, restated historically for segment
presentation. Kroll reportable segments are now organized, managed and
operated along product lines, as these product lines are provided to similar
clients, are offered together as packaged offerings, generally produce similar
margins and are managed under a consolidated operations management.
The Consulting Services segment includes revenues from business
investigations and intelligence services as well as financial services. Business
investigations and intelligence services include revenues from nonfinancial due
diligence, litigation support, fraud investigations, monitoring services and
special inquiries, and intellectual property and infringement investigations.
Financial services include revenues from forensic accounting, recovery and
restructuring, asset tracing and analysis, and pre-acquisition due diligence.
The Security Services segment includes revenues from security and
technology services. Security services include revenues from threat assessment,
risk and crisis management, corporate security planning and executive
protection, security architecture and design, and electronic countermeasures.
Technology services include revenues from computer forensics and data recovery,
information security and litigation and systems support.
67     The Employee Screening Services segment includes revenues from
pre-employment background checking, drug testing and surveillance.

Kroll laboratory testing operations are certified and subject to
frequent inspections and proficiency tests by certain federal, state or local
jurisdictions. Management believes that potential claims from such audits and
investigations will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial statements.
Kroll has foreign operations and assets in Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia,
Singapore, South Africa, the Philippines and the United Kingdom. In addition,
Kroll sells its products and services in other foreign countries and continues
to increase its level of international activity. Accordingly, Kroll is subject
to various risks including, among others, foreign currency restrictions,
exchange rate fluctuations, government instability and complexities of local
laws and regulations.

On February 21, 2002, Kroll executed agreements with Foothill Capital
Corporation to provide a revolving credit facility of up to $15 million, subject
to borrowing base limitations, for a term of three years. The borrowing amount
is calculated based on an analysis of Kroll accounts receivable and unbilled
revenues as of the month end preceding the borrowing date. Borrowings under the
credit facility will bear interest, at Kroll election, at a rate per annum
equal to 1 a base rate, which will be the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., plus 075% or 2 LIBOR plus 275%. During the term of the credit
facility, Kroll will pay Foothill Capital a fee equal to the product of 0375%
per annum and the unused portion of the credit facility. The credit facility
agreement requires Kroll to maintain a minimum level of EBITDA, and contains
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, the creation of any liens on
any of Kroll assets, certain acquisitions, distributions to certain
subsidiaries and other affirmative and negative covenants customarily contained
in debt agreements of this type. The credit facility is secured by a security
interest in substantially all of the assets of Kroll and its material domestic
subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of certain of Kroll subsidiaries. As of
March 21, 2002, there were no amounts borrowed under the credit facility.                    72 Item 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Our code of regulations provides that the number of Kroll directors will
not be less than the lesser of three or the number of shareholders of record,
the exact number of which may be fixed or changed by a majority vote of
directors at any meeting of the board of directors at which a quorum is present
or at a meeting of the shareholders called for the purpose of electing directors
at which a quorum is present by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares
entitled to vote on such proposal. Directors are elected for a one year term by
the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares actually voted at the
meeting. Directors will remain directors until the next annual meeting of the
shareholders and until their successors are duly elected or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.
Section 16a Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16a
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Kroll executive officers and
directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of Kroll
equity securities, to file reports of security ownership and changes in that
ownership with the
75 Securities and Exchange Commission. These persons are also required by SEC
regulations to furnish Kroll with copies of all Section 16a forms they file.
Based upon a review of copies of these forms and written representations from
its executive officers and directors, Kroll believes that all Section 16a
forms were filed on a timely basis during and for 2001 except that the Form 3 of
Mr. Shmerling, which was timely filed, was later amended.
