Item8
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Innospec Inc.:  In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Innospec Inc. and its subsidiaries at December31, 2007 and December31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO. The Companys management is responsible for these
financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report On Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting appearing in Item9A of this Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.  As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share based
compensation on adoption of FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, effective January1, 2006, defined benefit pension plans on adoption of FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
effective December31, 2006, and uncertain tax positions on adoption of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, effective January1, 2007. 
A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
49 Table of Contents
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Manchester, United Kingdom February25, 2008

Note 1. Nature of Operations  Innospec Inc. develops, manufactures, blends and markets fuel additives and other specialty
chemicals. Our products are sold primarily to oil refineries and other chemical and industrial companies throughout the world. Our fuel additives help improve fuel efficiency, boost engine performance and reduce harmful emissions. Our specialty
chemicals provide effective technology-based solutions for our customers processes or products focused in the Personal Care; Household, Industrial Institutional; Fragrance Ingredients; Plastics Polymers and
Pulp Paper markets. Principal product lines and reportable segments are Fuel Specialties, Active Chemicals and Octane Additives.  See Note 3 for financial information on the Companys reportable segments. 
See Note 10 for the accounting in respect of sales and marketing agreements with Ethyl. 
On June18, 2007 the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a 2-for-1 stock split to be effected in the form of a 100% stock
dividend. Stockholders of record as of July6, 2007 received one additional share of Innospec Inc. common stock for every share they owned on that date. The shares were distributed on July20, 2007. Stock option holders received one
additional option for every option they held and the original exercise prices for these options were halved to reflect the stock split. The consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted for this stock split.  Note 2. Accounting Policies  Basis of Preparation: The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and include all subsidiaries of the Company where the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and balances have been
eliminated upon consolidation. All acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and the results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results of discontinued
operations are shown separately in the income statement. Certain revisions have been made to prior year components of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows to conform to current year classifications. This
change in presentation did not result in a change to net cash used in/provided by financing activities.  Use of Estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
56 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Cash Equivalents: Investment securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered
to be cash equivalents.  Accounts Receivable: The Company records
accounts receivable at net realizable value and maintains an allowance for customers not making required payments. The Company determines the adequacy of the allowance by periodically evaluating each customer receivable considering our
customers financial condition, credit history and current economic conditions.  Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost FIFO method or market price. Cost includes materials, labor, and an appropriate proportion of plant overheads. The Company accrues volume discounts where it is probable that
the required volume will be attained and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The discounts are recorded as a reduction in the cost of materials based on projected purchases over the period of the agreement. Provision is made for slow-moving or
obsolete inventories as appropriate.  Property, Plant and Equipment:
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. The cost of additions and improvements are capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expenses. When assets are sold or retired the associated cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the consolidated financial statements and any related gain or loss is included in earnings. The
estimated useful lives of the major classes of depreciable assets are as follows:  Buildings
7to25years
Equipment
3 to 10 years
Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to at least annual impairment tests. Other intangible assets continue to be amortized using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives. The annual measurement date for impairment testing of Fuel Specialties and Active Chemicals goodwill is December31. Octane Additives business goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of each quarter. The Company
regularly reviews goodwill and the other intangible assets for impairment based on projected post-tax cash flows discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of capital. As expected the decline in the Octane Additives market has resulted
in quarterly impairment charges being incurred from the first quarter of 2004 onwards. It is highly likely that further quarterly charges will be incurred in future years as the market continues to decline. The impairment reviews of the goodwill
relating to the Fuel Specialties and Active Chemicals businesses indicates that there is no requirement to recognize an impairment charge in respect of this goodwill.  Deferred Finance Costs: The costs relating to debt financing are capitalized, separately disclosed in the balance sheets and
amortized using the effective interest method over the expected life of the debt financing facility. 
57 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:
The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including buildings and equipment, whenever changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying values may be impaired. In order to facilitate this test the Company groups together
assets at the lowest possible level for which cash flow information is available. Undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the assets are compared with the carrying value of the assets and if they are lower an impairment loss may be
recognized. The amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Fair values are determined using post-tax cash flows discounted at the Companys weighted average cost of capital.
Derivative Financial Instruments: The Company uses various derivative
instruments including forward currency contracts, options, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps to manage certain exposures. These instruments are entered into under the Companys corporate risk management policy to minimize exposure and are
not for speculative trading purposes. FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and, requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as
either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges, or do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under FAS
133, are recognized in earnings. Derivatives are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The ineffective portion of the derivatives change in value is recognized in earnings. The effective portion is recognized in other comprehensive
loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company employs interest rate swaps which convert floating rate debt on $500 million of the remaining $750 million senior term loan to fixed rate. These have been designated as cash flow
hedges of the underlying variable rate obligation. These have been tested for effectiveness using the dollar offset method. At the end of the term of the swap arrangements the cumulative gain or loss will be reclassified to the income statement. The
interest rate swaps have been recorded as a non-current liability in the balance sheet. In 2007 the Company hedged the price of 450 metric tonnes of one of its key raw materials using commodity swaps. These swaps have maturity dates between 1 and 12
months and as at December31 2007 the market value of the swaps to the Company was a loss of $05 million. These swaps have been designated as qualifying for hedge accounting. At the end of the swap arrangements the cumulative gain or loss will
be reclassified to the income statement. These commodity swaps have been recorded as a non-current liability in the balance sheet.  Environmental Compliance and Remediation: Environmental compliance costs include ongoing maintenance, monitoring and similar costs. Environmental costs are accrued
when environmental assessments or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future obligations are discounted to their present
values using the Companys weighted average cost of capital. 
58 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Revenue Recognition: The Company supplies products to customers from its various manufacturing sites, and in
some instances from containers held on customer sites, under a variety of standard shipping terms and conditions. In each case revenue is recognized when the transfer of legal title, which is defined and generally accepted in the standard terms and
conditions, arises between the Company and the customer. Provisions for sales discounts and rebates to customers are based upon the terms of sales contracts and are recorded in the same period as the related sales as a deduction from revenue. The
Company estimates the provision for sales discounts and rebates based on the terms of each agreement at the time of shipping. The Company recognized the total revenue from Octane Additive sales under the Ethyl agreements. The 32% compensation which
was paid to Ethyl was recognized in cost of goods sold. A component of Ethyls share of net proceeds was an amount recoverable from Ethyl that was calculated annually in arrears. The Company recognized this quarterly based on best current
estimates of the expected outcome. See Note 10 for the accounting in respect of sales and marketing agreements with Ethyl.  Components of Net Sales: All amounts billed to customers relating to shipping and handling are classified as net sales.Shipping and handling costs incurred
by the Company are classified as cost of goods sold.  Components of Cost of
Goods Sold: Cost of goods sold is comprised of raw material costs including inbound freight, duty and non-recoverable taxes, inbound handling costs associated with the receipt of raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs including
labor costs, maintenance and utility costs, plant and engineering overheads, warehousing and outbound shipping costs and handling costs. Inventory losses and provisions and the costs of customer claims are also recognized in the cost of goods line
item. The 32% compensation which was paid to Ethyl was recognized in cost of goods sold see Note 10 for the accounting in respect of sales and marketing agreements with Ethyl.  Components of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Selling expenses comprise the costs of the direct sales force and the
sales management and customer service departments required to support them. It also comprises commission charges, the costs of sales conferences and trade shows, the cost of advertising and promotions and the cost of bad and doubtful debts. General
and administrative expenses comprise the cost of support functions including accounting, human resources, information technology and the cost of group functions including corporate management, finance, tax, treasury, investor relations and legal
departments. Provision of managements best estimate of legal costs for litigation in which the Company is involved is made and reported in the administrative expense line item.  Research and Development Expenses: Research, development and testing costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Earnings Per Share: Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the effect of options that are dilutive and outstanding during the period. 
59 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Foreign Currencies: The Companys policy is that exchange differences arising on the translation of the
balance sheets of entities that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to a separate equity reserve, the cumulative translation adjustment. In entities where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency no gains or losses on
translation occur. In these entities gains or losses on monetary assets relating to currencies other than the U.S. dollar are taken to the income statement. Gains or losses on foreign currency transactions are included in other net income/expense
in the income statement and were $75 million net gain, $76 million net gain and $37 million net loss in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  Stock Option Plans: Effective January1, 2006 the Company adopted the provisions of FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment, which requires employee stock
options to be accounted for under the fair value method. Accordingly share-based compensation is now measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the options. Prior to January1, 2006 the Company accounted for employee stock options
using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25, and related interpretations, and provided the required pro forma disclosures
prescribed by FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and FAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. Under APB 25, for fixed awards, when the exercise price of employee stock options
was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense was recorded. The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this method the compensation cost recognized
by the Company beginning in 2006 includes acompensation cost for all stock options granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
FAS 123, and bcompensation cost for all stock options granted subsequent to January1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. The Company uses the straight-line attribution
method to recognize share-based compensation costs over the service period of the option.  Pension Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits: Effective for fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans. FAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined-benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, and changes in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income. FAS 158
also requires the measurement date of the plans funded status to be the same as the Companys fiscal year-end. Although the measurement date provision was not required to be adopted until fiscal year 2008 the Company early-adopted this
provision for fiscal year 2006. Pension plans are accounted for in accordance with FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, FAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and FAS
88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. 
60 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Income Taxes: The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with FAS 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the relevant tax bases of the assets and
liabilities. When appropriate, in accordance with FAS 109, the Company evaluates the need for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets. FAS 109 requires the recognition of future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such
benefits is more likely than not. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Income tax positions must
meet a more likely than not recognition criteria at the adoption date to be recognized upon the adoption of FIN 48. The Company adopted FIN 48 on January1, 2007 and the provisions have been applied to all income tax positions from that date.
On adoption of FIN 48 the Company recognized an increase in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $31 million which was accounted for as an adjustment to opening retained earnings; and reclassifications of $210 million from other
liabilities, $38 million from deferred income taxes and $78 million from accrued income taxes. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income taxes in our consolidated statements of
income.

Note 3. Business Segment and Geographical Area Data  Innospec divides its business into three distinct segments for both management and reporting
purposes: Fuel Specialties, Active Chemicals previously Performance Chemicals as explained below and Octane Additives. The Fuel Specialties and Active Chemicals businesses both operate in markets where we actively seek growth opportunities albeit
their end customers are very different. The Octane Additives business, although still profitable, is characterized by substantial declining demand.  On October1, 2007 the Company announced a further streamlining of its fast-growing Performance Chemicals division into a unified, sales-led global business focused
on rapidly meeting customers needs anywhere in three geographical regions and five core industry sectors. This led to the segment being re-branded under the banner Active Chemicals. The five core industry sectors are Personal Care;
Household, Industrial Institutional; Fragrance Ingredients; Plastics Polymers and Pulp Paper markets.  In 2007 the Company had one significant customer in the Fuel Specialties business, Royal Dutch Shell plc and its affiliates Shell, who accounted for $662
million 11%of net sales. In 2006 and 2005 no single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales.

area.  Goodwill has not been allocated by geographical location on the grounds
that it would be impracticable to do so.

Note 4. Stock Option Plans  On June18, 2007 the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a
2-for-1 stock split to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Stockholders of record as of July6, 2007 received one additional share of Innospec Inc. common stock for every share they owned on that date. The shares were distributed
on July20, 2007. Stock option holders received one additional option for every option they held and the original exercise prices for these options were halved to reflect the stock split.  The Company has five active stock option plans, three of which provide for grants of options
to key employees and non-employee directors. One other plan provides stock options on an equal basis to all United Kingdom employees, and another provides stock options to all Company employees. The current limit for the number of shares of common
stock which can be issued or awarded under the plans is 6,086,000. The stock options issued have a vesting period of three to six years and expire within ten years of the date of grant. All grants are at the sole discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors which administers the plans. Grants may be priced at market value or at a premium or discount.  On January1, 2006 the Company adopted FAS 123R, Share-Based Payment. FAS 123R requires a company to estimate the number of forfeitures expected to occur and
record expense based upon the number of awards expected to vest. Prior to adoption, the Company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred as permitted under previous accounting standards. The cumulative effect of adopting the change in estimating
forfeitures was not material to the Companys financial statements for year ended December31, 2006.  The fair value of these options is calculated using the Black-Scholes model. In some cases certain performance related options are dependent upon external factors such as the Companys share price. The fair value
of these options is calculated using a Monte Carlo model.  The following
assumptions were used to determine the fair value of options calculated using the Black-Scholes model:  2007 2006 2005 Dividend yield

vested stock options is $06 million. Of the 241,020 stock options that are exercisable, 67,442 have performance conditions attached. The total compensation cost for 2007 and 2006 was $33 million and $16 million, respectively. The total
compensation cost related to nonvested stock options not yet recognized at December31, 2007 is $78 million and this cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of 153 years. 
67 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
We have not modified any stock option awards in 2007, 2006 or 2005. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in
2007 and 2006 was $19 million and $09 million, respectively. The amount of cash received from the exercise of stock option awards in 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $41 million, $30 million and $14 million, respectively. The Companys policy is to
issue shares from Treasury stock to holders of stock options who exercise those options. During 2007 and 2006 the new total fair value of shares vested was $22 million and $09 million, respectively.  The Company adopted FAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method beginning
January1, 2006. The Company previously recorded a charge for stock options based on the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25.
The following table summarizes the effect on net income and earnings per share for the year ended December31, 2005 if the Company had adopted FAS 123R. As of January1, 2006 compensation expense has been recorded within the consolidated

Note 6.Pension Plans  The Company maintains a contributory defined benefit pension plan covering a number of its United Kingdom employees the Plan. The Projected Benefit
Obligation PBO is based on final salary and years of credited service reduced by social security benefits according to a plan formula. Normal retirement age is 65 but provisions are made for early retirement.  The Company is contributing amounts to the Plan to cover service costs to date. Employee and
employer contributions from January1, 2004 to January1, 2007 were at 5% and 226%, respectively, of pensionable pay. From January1, 2007 employee and employer contributions were at 7% and 29%, respectively. In addition, since March
2007, the Company has been contributing $3 million per calendar year in accordance with a 10 year deficit recovery plan. The Plans assets are invested by two investment management companies in funds holding United Kingdom and overseas
equities, United Kingdom and overseas fixed interest securities, index linked securities, property unit trusts and cash or cash equivalents. A full actuarial valuation of the Plan was performed as at December31, 2005 and an update performed as
at December31, 2007 and 2006, the results of both of which are reflected in the calculations below. 
69 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Effective for fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of FAS 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. FAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined-benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, and certain changes in the funded status be
reflected in comprehensive income. FAS 158 also requires the measurement date of the Plans funded status to be the same as the Companys fiscal year-end. Although the measurement date provision was not required to be adopted until fiscal
year 2008 the Company early-adopted this provision for fiscal year 2006. The effect of applying FAS 158 was to record a total reduction to equity through recognition in other comprehensive loss of $970 million on an after-tax basis.  The Company had previously used a measurement date of October5. Accordingly, accounting
and disclosure for the Plan had been as at and for the 12 months ending October5. In accordance with FAS 158 the net pension charge of $15 million for the transition period of three months to December31, 2006 has been included in the
total reduction to equity of $970 million and disclosures for 2005 and 2004 have not been modified from those previously reported.  in millions

The discount rate used represents the annualized yield on medium and longer term AA rated corporate bonds in the
United Kingdom and has been determined by reference to the iBoxx corporate bond index published by International Index Company. The rate of increase in compensation levels assumes that real salary growth in Innospec will be restricted to 075% above
an assumed level of price inflation of 32%. A 025% change in either the discount rate assumption, or level of price inflation assumption, would change the PBO by approximately $30 million and the net pension charge for 2008 by approximately $02
million.  The current investment strategy of the Plan is to obtain an asset
allocation of 70% in favor of debt securities and 30% equity securities in order to achieve a more predictable return on assets.  The projected net pension charge for the year ending December31, 2008 is as follows:  in millions Service cost 56 Interest cost on PBO 488 Expected return on plan assets 520 24  The estimated level of Company

At December31, 2007, the underlying PBO and fair value of Plan assets were translated at the 2007 year end exchange rate.  The accumulated benefit obligation for the Plan was $8263 million and $8717 million at December31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  Note 7.Income Taxes  On January1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes FIN 48. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
72 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
On adoption of FIN 48 the Company recognized an increase in its liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $31
million which was accounted for as an adjustment to opening retained earnings; and reclassifications of $210 million from other liabilities, $38 million from deferred income taxes and $78 million from accrued income taxes. A roll-forward of
unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties is as follows:  in millions

unrecognized tax benefits would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.  We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. As of December31, 2007, $38 million was accrued within the liability for
unrecognized tax benefits in respect of accrued interest and penalties.  The
Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As at December31, 2007, the Companys subsidiaries in France and the United Kingdom are subject to
tax authority investigations into their respective transfer pricing policies. The Company does not anticipate that adjustments arising out of these investigations would result in a material change to its financial position as at December31,
2007.  The Company and its U.S. subsidiaries remain open to examination by the
IRS for years 1998 onwards due to the net operating losses in the period 1998 to 2002, although no examination is currently underway. The Companys subsidiaries in other major tax jurisdictions are open to examination including France 2004
onwards, Germany 2002 onwards, Switzerland 2005 onwards and the United Kingdom 2002 onwards. We are currently under examination in various foreign jurisdictions.

The $121 million charge in respect of the impairment of Octane Additives business goodwill has no cash or taxation
impact and represents a significant factor in the variation from the U.S. federal statutory rate. Other significant factors affecting the variation to the statutory rate is a deemed liquidation of a group subsidiary, treated as a dividend under U.S.
tax rules, net of foreign tax credits, the use of tax losses for which no deferred tax asset had been recognized and tax credits from prior years. The mix of taxable profits generated in the different geographical localities in which the Group
operates had a positive impact on the effective tax rate in 2007.  Details of
deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:  in millions
2007 2006 Deferred tax assets Excess of tax over book basis in property, plant and equipment 38 33 Net operating loss carry forwards 36 18 Pension liability 68 Goodwill amortization 29 Foreign tax credits 65 Other 42 27 210 146 Valuation allowance 88 10 Total deferred tax assets 122 136 Deferred tax liabilities Pension asset 97 Intangible assets 59 69 Other 40 51 196 120 Total net deferred liability/asset 74 16  As a result of the Companys
assessment of its net deferred tax assets at December31, 2007, the Company considers it more likely than not that no valuation allowance is required for $13 million 2006 - $08 million of its net operating loss carry forwards and that a
full valuation allowance is required against its foreign tax credits carry forwards. The net operating loss carry forwards arose in 2007 and were generated in Switzerland as a result of exceptional losses on a contract. It is expected that
sufficient taxable profits will be generated against which the net operating loss carry forwards can be relieved and there is no time limitation to use these losses. Should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not
that these assets will be realized an additional valuation allowance would be required and the Companys operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such a determination would be made.  The Company has not made provision for unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries on the
grounds that they will not be remitted as they are required in the entities concerned or will continue to be used to fund further investment into other territories. The amount of unremitted 
75 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
earnings at December31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately $805 million and $710 million, respectively. Any determination of the potential amount of
unrecognized deferred taxes is not practicable due to the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.  Note 8.Acquisitions  On January14, 2005, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Finetex, Inc. Finetex for consideration of $212 million. The Company purchased 234 common
shares which were valued at $174 million. The balance of the funds was used to separately acquire the two properties on which the business operates and to pay costs of the acquisition.  Finetex is a manufacturer and supplier of specialty surfactants and emollients to the personal care, cosmetics and other industrial markets.
The results of Finetex have been consolidated since the acquisition date and have been reported in the Active Chemicals business segment. In 2005, since its acquisition by the Company, Finetex contributed $184 million of net sales and a net profit
of $02 million to the consolidated net loss $001 profit per basic share. During the third quarter of 2005 the inventory standard costing process at Finetex was updated. This led to an increase of $05 million in the fair value of inventory
acquired and a corresponding reduction in goodwill. The following values have been assigned to the major classes of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets of the acquired entities at acquisition date:  in millions Cash 02 Receivables 23 Inventories 40 Prepayments 01 Property, plant and equipment 73 Goodwill 36 Intangible assets 71 Total assets 246 Current liabilities 08 Deferred taxes 24 Other non-current liabilities 02 Total liabilities 34 Net assets acquired 212  The goodwill recognized in respect of

generally consistent with the operating segments underlying the segments identified in Note 3.  The Company adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January1, 2002. This requires that goodwill deemed to have an indefinite life should no longer be amortized, but subject to an
annual impairment review, or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred.  Due to the continuing decline in the world market for Octane Additives, goodwill in respect of the Octane Additives business segment is reviewed for impairment on a
quarterly basis.  The Company has elected to perform its annual tests in
respect of Fuel Specialties and Active Chemicals goodwill as of December31 each year.  In reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the impaired reporting units underlying the segments is estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on managements best estimates at that
time. 
77 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
As a result of the Octane Additives impairment reviews performed during 2007, 2006 and 2005 impairment charges of
$121 million, $367 million and $1344 million, respectively, were recognized. These charges are non-cash in nature and have no impact on taxation. There is $127 million of goodwill remaining which relates to the Octane Additives business. Given
the quantum and predictability of the remaining future cash flows from the Octane Additives business the Company expects goodwill impairment charges to be recognized in the income statement on an approximate straight-line basis over the three years
ending December31, 2010.  At the end of the fourth quarter of 2007 the
Company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill for Fuel Specialties and Active Chemicals and believes that there has been no impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments.  Note 10.Intangible Assets  Intangible assets comprise the following:  in millions

marketing agreements TMAs with Ethyl Corporation Ethyl to market and sell tetra ethyl lead TEL in all areas of the world except North America and the European Economic Area for the period lasting until
December31, 2009, subject to renewal thereafter. This relationship was extended effective January1, 2000 when two of our Swiss subsidiaries entered into similar TMAs with Ethyls 
78 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Swiss subsidiaries. In April 2000, Ethyl made a payment to Innospec of $386 million as a prepayment for services to be provided under the Swiss TMAs.
Effective July1, 2001, another of our Swiss subsidiaries entered into a TMA with Veritel Chemicals BV Veritel and Ethyl agreed to participate in this TMA with the scope of all the TMAs being extended to include the European
Economic Area.  No separate legal entity or joint venture was established as a
consequence of the TMAs. All marketing and sales effort made under these arrangements were made in the name of Innospec. Innospec produced all TEL marketed under the TMAs and also provided marketing and other services. Ethyl provided bulk
distribution services, marketing and other services. In addition, Ethyl was required to hold approximately one third of the inventories sold under these arrangements or deposit an equivalent dollar amount with Innospec. At March31, 2007, Ethyl
held no TEL inventories in respect of the TMAs and accordingly had deposited $120 million with us. The net proceeds under the TMAs were paid to Innospec and Ethyl as compensation for services and based on an agreed-upon formula, with
Innospec receiving 68% of the total compensation for services provided and Ethyl receiving 32%. Ethyls 32% share of the net proceeds was advanced to Ethyl by us when payment was received from the TMA customers.  Sales and expenses incurred under the TMAs were included within Innospecs income
statement. These comprised all revenues and costs incurred directly by Innospec, together with costs recharged by Ethyl for bulk distribution services, marketing and other services provided under the TMAs. Ethyls share of the net proceeds for
services was charged within cost of goods sold. The $386 million prepayment for TMA services to be provided was treated as deferred income and amortized to the income statement within cost of goods sold. Net proceeds due to Ethyl were held within
accounts payable.  Innospec had commenced proceedings in the London Court of
International Arbitration LCIA against Ethyl regarding an alleged breach of duty by Ethyl under the TMAs by actively marketing and selling an alternative product. In addition, the Company was in dispute with Ethyl regarding the price
that it was entitled to charge for the supply of TEL to Ethyl in the U.S. under a separate agreement U.S. Supply Agreement. On June15, 2007, both parties resolved all of the arbitration actions arising out of the disputes under
the TMAs and the U.S. Supply Agreement. The TMAs were terminated effective April1, 2007, and Innospec became the sole supplier of TEL outside of the U.S. On June27, 2007, Innospec refunded Ethyls $120 million inventory deposit,
advanced Ethyls share of net proceeds which had not yet been collected from TMA customers as at the termination date, and made a payment of $280 million in respect of Ethyl foregoing their entitlement to a share of the future income stream
under the TMAs effective April1, 2007. In addition, the $19 million unamortized balance at March31, 2007 of the Ethyl prepayment for services to be provided under the TMAs was written off to cost of goods sold in the income statement.
During the course of this settlement we incurred professional fees of $04 million. 
79 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
An intangible asset has been recognized in respect of the payment to Ethyl, which represented Ethyl foregoing their
entitlement to a share of the future income stream under the TMAs effective April1, 2007, and associated professional fees. The TMAs covered the sale of TEL for use in automotive gasoline and aviation gasoline which we disclose within our
Octane Additives business segment and our Fuel Specialties business segment, respectively. We have allocated the individual components of the intangible asset attributable to TEL for use in automotive gasoline and aviation gasoline by reference to
the forecast future income streams and associated cash flows from those markets which Ethyl would have shared in. No residual value has been attributed to the intangible asset. Accordingly, commencing April1, 2007, the amount attributed to the
Octane Additives business segment is being amortized straight-line to December31, 2010 and the amount attributed to the Fuel Specialties business segment is being amortized straight-line to December31, 2017.  Veritel  An intangible asset was recognized in 2001 in relation to amounts payable to Veritel
Chemicals BV by our Swiss subsidiary pursuant to a marketing agreement effective July1, 2001. An initial signing fee of $50 million was paid on entering into the agreement. In December 2001, notice was given of a permanent source interruption
which triggered further payments due to Veritel of $700 million. Under the terms of a separate marketing agreement with Ethyl, $245 million was recoverable from Ethyl, and the Companys share of $505 million was capitalized by our Swiss
subsidiary. The asset is fully amortized as at December31, 2007.  Technology  Following the acquisition of
the remaining 50% of Innospec Fuel Specialties LLC previously known as Octel Starreon LLC on July8, 2004, the Company recognized an intangible asset of $23 million in respect of various technological approvals the business has received from
certain military and civilian authorities. The approvals act as a barrier to entry to any potential competitor in the market who would wish to supply these products.  An intangible asset of $48 million was recognized in respect of a number of specialized manufacturing processes carried out by Innospec
Widnes Limited previously known as Aroma Fine Chemicals Limited following the acquisition of that entity in August 2004.  Both of these assets have an expected life of ten years and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over this period. No residual value is anticipated.  Customer relationships  Following the acquisition of Finetex now merged into Innospec Active Chemicals LLC, the
Company recognized an intangible asset totalling $71 million, $42 million of which was in relation to customer lists acquired. This asset has an expected life of thirteen years and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over this period. No
residual value is anticipated. 
80 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Intangible assets were recognized in 2004 in respect of both the Innospec Fuel Specialties LLC previously known as
Octel Starreon LLC $90 million, and Innospec Widnes Limited previously known as Aroma Fine Chemicals Limited $28 million acquisitions. These relate to ongoing customer relationships. These have an expected life of ten years and will be
amortized on a straight-line basis over that period. No residual value is anticipated.  Patents  Following the acquisition of Finetex now merged into Innospec Active Chemicals LLC, the Company recognized an intangible asset of $29 million in respect of patents and
trademarks. These have an expected life of ten years and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over that period.  Other  The remaining balance relates chiefly to software costs which are amortized over 3 years. 
The Company adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January1, 2002. This requires that intangible assets should be
subject to an annual impairment review, or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred. The Company has elected to perform its annual tests in respect of its intangible assets as of
December31 each year. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company performed its annual impairment review of intangible assets and believes that no impairment exists.  Intangible asset amortization expense was $169 million, $127 million and $127 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
Future amortization expense is estimated to be $82 million per annum for the three years
to 2010, and then $36 million per annum in 2011 and 2012.  Note
11. Deferred Finance Costs  The Company entered
into a three and one half year financing facility on December13, 2005 see Note 14. This replaced the previous Company debt facility which existed at December31, 2004. The net book amount of the deferred finance costs which had been
capitalized as a result of the refinancing in January 2004, some $14 million at the beginning of 2005, was amortized in full during 2005 as a consequence of the refinancing.  In 2006 and 2005, $05 million and $21 million of refinancing costs were capitalized, respectively. These were incurred in relation to the
refinancing entered into on December13, 2005. These will be amortized over the expected life of the agreement using the effective interest method.  in millions

The liability for estimated closure costs of Innospecs Octane Additives
manufacturing facilities includes costs for personnel reductions severance, decontamination and environmental remediation activities remediation when demand for TEL diminishes. Severance provisions have also been made in relation to the Fuel
Specialties and the Active Chemicals businesses.  Movements in the provisions

Severance charges are recognized in the income statement as restructuring costs along with other restructuring costs.
Remediation costs are recognized in cost of goods sold.  Severance  A charge of $05 million was
recognized in respect of a reduction in Active Chemicals United Kingdom headcount $04 million and additional payments in respect of the former CEO $01 million.  Other Restructuring 
The $25 million charge primarily relates to United Kingdom site clearance $12 million and relocation of our European Headquarters to the Ellesmere Port
site $08 million.  Remediation
Total costs for remediation are evaluated on a regular basis to take
account of expenditure incurred and to amend the scope of future activities in the light of findings from projects carried out. A detailed review of the expected future costs of decontamination and remediation at the Ellesmere Port site was
concluded in December 2004. The results were summarized in a discounted cash flow model and the results are reflected herein.  Remediation expenditure against provisions was $17 million, $13 million and $22 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.  The remediation provision represents the fair value of the Companys liability
recognized under FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. The accretion expense recognized under FAS 143 in 2007 was $23 million. This charge was offset in 2007 by $10 million in respect of a reduction in the scope and cost of
future activities to be performed in the light of findings from projects carried out.  The Company records environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be estimated reasonably. The Company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future costs, and has to comply with environmental
legislation in the relevant countries. The Company views the costs of vacating our main United Kingdom site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site. The Company has further determined that, due to the
uncertain product life of TEL, particularly in the market for aviation gas, there exists such uncertainty as to the timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate these flows sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision.

were $64 million, $93 million and $76 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The net cash outflow in respect of refinancing costs was $nil million, $05 million and $20 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  The financing package agreed in January 2004, and amended in August 2004, comprised a term loan of $100 million and a revolving credit facility of $110 million. The term
loan was repayable in annual instalments over three and one half years. The revolving facility was available throughout the loan period until July 2007. There was $119 million outstanding under the terms of this facility at December31, 2004.
On December13, 2005 the Company entered into an agreement with a
syndicate of banks for a new term loan of $100 million repayable over three and one half years. Of this term loan $10 million, $15 million and $20 million was repaid on July31, 2006,January31, 2007, and January31, 2008,
respectively. A final repayment of $55 million is due on June12, 2009. An additional revolving credit facility was also agreed which will expire on June12, 2009. This revolving credit facility was initially $671 million but was then
increased by $329 million to $100 million on June12, 2006 when The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and National Australia Bank Limited joined the syndicate of lending banks. There was $810 million outstanding under this facility at
December31, 2007.  The facility contains terms which, if breached, would
result in the loan becoming repayable on demand. It requires, among other matters, compliance with two financial covenant ratios. These ratios are 1the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and 2the ratio of net interest to EBITA. EBITDA and
EBITA are non U.S. GAAP measures of liquidity defined in the finance facility. In the event that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA exceeds 20 then in addition to these covenants, the facility also requires a look forward test and an
additional financial covenant ratio in the form of net operating cash flow before finance costs to scheduled debt amortization and interest costs. This look forward test was not applicable to the Company during 2007 due to such ratio not
being exceeded. 
84 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Management believes that the Company has not breached these covenants throughout 2007. The facility is secured by a
number of fixed and floating charges over certain assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.  No assets held under capital leases were capitalized during 2007 2006 - $nil. $01 million of capital repayments were made during 2007 2006 - $02 million.

Long-term debt: The carrying amount of long-term borrowings at variable interest rates approximates fair
value.  Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives that relates to
interest rate swaps, interest rate swap options, foreign exchange contracts and commodity swaps was estimated based on current settlement prices and comparable contracts using current assumptions.  The cumulative gains and losses on the interest rate swaps and commodity swaps are summarized
as follows:  in millions
2007 2006
Balance at January1 04 01
Change in fair value 14 03 Balance at December31 10 04  The interest rate swaps have been
designated as a cash flow hedge against $500 million of underlying floating rate debt obligations that stood at $810 million at December31, 2007. All of the swaps mature on June12, 2009.  The commodity swaps are used to manage the Companys cash flow exposure to raw material
price volatility. They have been designated as cash flow hedges and all the commodity swaps qualify for hedge accounting as at December31, 2007.  The interest rate and commodity hedges were determined to be effective and consequently the unrealized loss of $10 million in 2007 2006 - $04 million gain has been
recorded in other comprehensive income. Ineffectiveness was determined to be immaterial in 2007 and 2006 and accordingly no gain or loss was recognized in earnings in either period. The Company does not expect any significant portion of the loss to
be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.  Foreign exchange
contracts primarily relate to contracts entered into to hedge future known transactions or hedge balance sheet net cash positions. The movements in the carrying and fair values of these contracts is largely due to changes in exchange rates against
the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar has weakened against other major currencies across 2007.  Note 18. Financial Instruments and Risk Management  The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not trade them. The Company does use derivatives to manage certain interest rate,
foreign exchange exposures and raw material pricing exposures.  The Company
uses interest rate swaps, floors, collar and cap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt. The swap agreements are contracts to exchange floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the
life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts. The notional amounts of interest rate agreements are used to measure interest to be paid or received and do not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss.

Contingencies  Bycosin Disposal  Voluntary disclosure of possible violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Given
the international scope of its operations, the Company is subject to laws of many different jurisdictions, including laws relating to the imposition of restrictions on trade and investment with various entities, persons and countries, some of which
laws are conflicting. In 2004 the Company reviewed, as it does periodically, aspects of its operations in respect of such restrictions, and determined to dispose of certain non-core, non-U.S. subsidiaries of Bycosin AB. Bycosins non-U.S.
subsidiaries had been engaged in transactions and activities involving Cuban persons and entities before the acquisition of the Bycosin Group by the Company in June 2001, and such subsidiaries were continuing to engage in such transactions and
activities at the time of the disposal of the non-core Fuel Specialties business and related assets in November 2004. On November15, 2004, Bycosin AB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company organized under the laws of Sweden now known as
Innospec Sweden AB, the Seller, entered into a Business and Asset Purchase Agreement the Agreement with Pesdo Swedcap Holdings AB the Purchaser, Hkan Bystrm and others as the Purchasers
guarantors, and Octel Petroleum Specialties Limited now known as Innospec Fuel Specialties Limited as the Sellers guarantor, and completed the all-cash transaction contemplated thereby together with related transactions, the
Transaction. The Agreement provided for, among other things: ithe disposal of certain non-core Fuel Specialties business and related manufacturing and other assets of the Seller; and iithe supply and distribution of
certain power products to certain geographic regions. The net consideration paid by the Purchaser was approximately US$29 million.  Following completion of the Transaction, the Company made a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control OFAC regarding transactions
and activities engaged in by certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company. Disclosures, amongst other items, included that the aggregate monetary value of the transactions involving Cuban persons and entities conducted by the Companys non-U.S.
subsidiaries since January 1999 is approximately $266 million.  At this time,
however, management believes that it would be speculative and potentially misleading for the Company to predict the specific nature or amount of penalties that OFAC might eventually assess against it. While penalties could be assessed on different
bases, if OFAC assessed penalties against the Company on a performance of contracts basis, the applicable regulations provide for penalties, in the case of civil violations of the Cuban Assets Control Regulations 31 CFR. Part 515
CACR, of the lesser of $65,000 per violation or the value of the contract. Since January 1999, non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company have entered into 43 contracts with Cuban entities, each of which could be considered a separate
violation of the CACR by OFAC. OFAC may take the position that the CACR should be interpreted or applied in a different manner, potentially even to permit the assessment of penalties equal to or greater than the value of the business conducted with
Cuban persons or entities. 
89 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
The Company has considered the range of possible outcomes and potential penalties payable. In accordance with the
Companys accounting policies, provision has been made for managements current best estimate of the potential liability, including anticipated legal costs. However, should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the actual outcome
could differ materially from managements current expectations. Management is not able to estimate the amount of any additional loss, if any.  If the Company or its subsidiaries current or former were found not to have complied with the CACR, the Company believes that it could be subject to fines or other
civil or criminal penalties which could be material.  Oil for Food  On February 7, 2006, the Securities and Exchange
Commission SEC notified the Company that it had commenced an investigation to determine whether any violations of law had occurred in connection with transactions conducted by the Company, including its wholly owned indirect
subsidiary, Alcor Chemie Vertriebs GmbH Alcor, a Swiss company, under the United Nations Oil for Food Program OFFP between June 1, 1999 and December 31, 2003. As part of its investigation, the SEC issued a subpoena
requiring the production of certain documents, including documents relating to these transactions, by the Company and Alcor. Upon receipt of the SECs notification and initial subpoena, the Company undertook a review of its participation in the
OFFP. On October 10, 2007 and November 1, 2007 the SEC served two additional subpoenas on the Company. These additional subpoenas required the production of documents relating notably to the OFFP but also relating to transactions conducted by the
Company or its subsidiaries with state owned or controlled entities between June 1, 1999 and the date of such subpoenas, relating to its use of foreign agents and the possibility of extra-contractual payments made to secure business with foreign
governmental entities. In a co-ordinated investigation, the Company has also been contacted by the U.S. Department of Justice DOJ regarding the possibility of violations of relevant laws in the areas contained in the SEC subpoenas as
well as additional preliminary inquiries regarding compliance with anti-trust laws relating to U.S. and international tetra ethyl lead markets. The subjects into which the SEC and DOJ have inquired include areas that involve certain former and
current executives of the Company including the current CEO. The Company, and its officers and directors, are cooperating with the SEC and DOJ investigations. On February 19, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company formed a committee comprised
of the chairmen of the Board, the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee respectively, all of whom are independent directors. Counsel to the Company, providing assistance to the committee has, on behalf of the committee,
conducted and will continue to conduct an investigation into the circumstances giving rise to the SEC and DOJ investigations. Counsel will report directly to the committee and will assist in connection with interactions with the SEC and DOJ. While
the outcome of these investigations is uncertain, a number of companies involved in the OFFP investigations have been required to disgorge profits and pay civil fines and penalties up to $30 million. As a result of information discovered in the
course 
90 Table of Contents NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
of the investigation, we expect that we will be required to disgorge profits and pay fines and penalties that could be of similar magnitude. Any settlement
of the SEC and DOJ inquiries relating to matters beyond the OFFP could require the Company to make significant additional disgorgements, penalty and fine payments. However at this time management is not able to predict with certainty the level of
such fines and penalties. Because of the uncertainties associated with the ultimate outcome of these investigations and the costs to the Company of responding and participating in these on-going investigations, no assurance can be given that the
ultimate costs and sanctions that may be imposed upon us will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows from operating activities. At December 31, 2007 we have accrued $37 million in respect
of probable future legal expenses in respect of this matter and have provided no additional accruals for this matter.  Other Legal Matters  We are involved from time to time in claims and legal proceedings that result from, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business including product liability claims.
There are no other material pending legal proceedings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or of which any of their property is subject, other than ordinary, routine litigation incidental to their respective businesses.
Guarantees  The Company and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable as of
December31, 2007, for $87 million, primarily relating to guarantees of debt of affiliated companies and performance under contracts entered into as a normal business practice. This included guarantees of non-U.S. excise taxes and customs
duties.  Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, generally the Company
would be required to perform should the affiliated company fail to fulfil its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements have recourse provisions that would enable the Company to recover any payments made under the
terms of the guarantees from securities held of the guaranteed parties assets.  The Company and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Company.  Indemnities and Warranties  In connection with the disposal of Octel Waste Management Limited on June26, 2003, the
Company provided certain warranties. The Company would be required to perform should the contingent liabilities in respect of the warranties become actual and could be required to make maximum future payments of 359million $71
million. There are no recourse provisions enabling recovery of any amounts from third parties nor are any assets held as collateral in respect of the warranties.

value measurements. The Company is required to adopt FAS 157 effective the first quarter of 2008. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this
standard will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  In February 2007, the FASB issued FAS 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. FAS 159 expands the scope of what entities may carry at fair value by offering an irrevocable
option to record many types of financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value would be recorded in an entitys income statement. This accounting standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements that are
intended to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. FAS 159 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after November15, 2007 though earlier
application is permitted under certain circumstances. The Company will adopt FAS 159 effective the first quarter of 2008. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.  In December2007, the FASB issued
FAS160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No51. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This statement is effective prospectively, except for certain retrospective disclosure requirements, for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the
adoption of FAS 160 will have on its financial statements.  In
December2007, the FASB issued FAS141R, Business Combinations a replacement of FASB Statement No141, which significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and
measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. The statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business
combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This statement is effective prospectively, except for certain retrospective
adjustments to deferred tax balances, for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of FAS 141R will have on its financial statements.

Managements Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.The Companys
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Because of its
inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007. In making this
assessment, management used the criteria in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO.  Based on the evaluation the Company concluded that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December31, 2007, based on criteria in the Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the COSO.  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  The Company is continuously seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations and of its internal controls. This results in refinements to processes
throughout the 
95 Table of Contents
Company. However, there has been no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Item9B
Other Information  None.
