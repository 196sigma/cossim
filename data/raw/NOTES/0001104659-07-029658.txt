60 Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Zoran
Corporation We have completed integrated audits of Zoran
Corporations consolidated financial statements and of its internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.
Consolidated financial statements
In our opinion, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying indexpresent fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Zoran Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December31, 2006 and December31, 2005, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has restated its fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004
consolidated financial statements.
As discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation in
fiscal 2006.
Internal control
over financial reporting
Also, in our opinion, managements assessment,
included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria.
Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31,
2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Companys management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment
andon the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal control over
financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. An audit of internal control over financial reporting
includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 61 A companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that ipertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; iiprovide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and iiiprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE1THE COMPANY
Zoran
Corporation Zoran or the Company was incorporated in California in December1981
and reincorporated in Delaware in November1986. Zoran develops and
markets integrated circuits, integrated circuit cores and embedded software used
by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, in digital audio and video
products for commercial and consumer markets, digital television applications
and digital imaging products. Current applications incorporating Zorans
products and IP include digital versatile disc, or DVD, players and recorders,
digital cameras, professional and consumer video editing systems, digital
speakers and audio systems, applications that enable the delivery and display
of digital video content through a set top box or television as well as digital
imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable
users to print, scan, process and transmit documents to computer peripherals
that perform printing functions. The Company operates in two reportable segments,
Consumer group which combines the former Digital Versatile Disc DVD, Digital
Television DTV and Mobile product groups and Imaging group.
Risk and Uncertainties
Because the
markets that the Companys customers serve are characterized by numerous new
product introductions and rapid product enhancements, its operating results may
vary significantly from quarter to quarter. During the final production of a
mature product, its customers typically exhaust their existing inventories of
the Companys products. Consequently, orders for its products may decline in
those circumstances, even if the products are incorporated into both mature
products and replacement products. A delay in a customers transition to
commercial production of a replacement product would delay the Companys
ability to recover the lost sales from the discontinuation of the related
mature product. The Companys customers also experience significant seasonality
in the sales of their consumer products, which affects their orders of the
Companys products. Typically, the second half of the calendar year represents
a disproportionate percentage of sales for the Companys customers due to the
holiday shopping period for consumer electronics products, and therefore, a
disproportionate percentage of the Companys sales.
Average
selling prices for the Companys products decline over relatively short time
periods, while many of its manufacturing costs are fixed. When the Companys
average selling prices decline, its revenues decline unless the Company is able
to sell more units, and its gross margins decline unless it is able to reduce
its manufacturing costs by a commensurate amount. The Companys operating
results suffer when gross margins decline. The Company has experienced these
problems, and the Company expects to continue to experience them in the future.
The Company
does not operate any manufacturing facilities, and it relies on independent
foundries to manufacture substantially all of its products. These independent
foundries fabricate products for other companies and may also produce products
of their own design. From time to time, there are manufacturing capacity
shortages in the semiconductor industry. The Company does not have long-term
supply contracts with any of its suppliers, including its principal supplier,
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. Therefore, TSMC and the
Companys other suppliers are not obligated to manufacture products for the
Company for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specified
price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order.
The Company anticipates that international sales will continue to
account for a substantial majority of its total revenues for the foreseeable
future. In addition, substantially all of its semiconductor products are
manufactured, assembled and tested outside of the United States by independent
foundries and  67  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued subcontractors. The Company is subject to a variety of risks
inherent in doing business internationally, including unexpected changes in regulatory
requirements fluctuations in exchange rates political and economic instability imposition of tariffs and other barriers
and restrictions the burdens of complying with a variety
of foreign laws; and
health risks in a particular region.
Economic,
political or military events in a country where the Company make significant
sales or has significant operations could harm its business.
Principles of consolidation and basis of presentation
The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Zoran and all of its
subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.
NOTE 2RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Independent Investigation
On July3,
2006, the Company announced that, at the recommendation of the Audit Committee,
the Board of Directors had created a special committee of independent directors
Special Committee to conduct a review of our historical stock option
practices. As a result of its investigation, the Special Committee found, among
other things, that some of the original measurement dates used by the Company
for option grants were not adequately supported by contemporaneous records, and
therefore the measurement dates used by us for accounting purposes required
adjustment. The Special Committee concluded that the evidence did not establish
that the errors which it identified resulted from fraud or intentional
misconduct by our current senior management.
Based on the
Special Committees findings and its own review of the facts, the Board of
Directors concluded that there was no fraud or intentional misconduct by any
current member of senior management. The Board also concluded that it has
confidence in the integrity of the Companys Chief Executive Officer, Dr.Levy
Gerzberg, and the Companys Chief Financial Officer, Mr.Karl Schneider.
Based on
information obtained from the Special Committees review and additional work
undertaken by the Company, management has concluded, and the Audit Committee
has agreed, that the Company should restate certain previously filed financial
statements, to reflect additional stock-based compensation expense with regard
to certain past stock option grants. The corrections made in the restatements
relate to options covering approximately 36million shares. These
adjustments amounted to an additional stock-based compensation expense of $04million
and $26million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, and a reduction of
expense of $15million in 2004. There was no tax impact of these
additional stock-based compensation expenses due to the full valuation
allowance on our tax assets. 68  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued In connection
with the restatement, the Company is recording additional non-cash adjustments
that were previously considered to be immaterial relating to the timing of
revenue recognition, accrued expenses, amortization of premiums and discounts
on investments, additional expense related to options granted to a consultant
and the calculation of amortization of stock-based compensation relating to a
business combination in 2003. The Company is also recording losses under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18 APB No18, The Equity Method of Accounting
for Investments in Common Stock, to record the losses on investment of the prior
17% ownership of Oren Semiconductor,Inc. under the equity method of
accounting which was subsequently acquired by Zoran in 2005. These additional
adjustments resulted in a cumulative expense of $13million, including
$02million of tax expense, for the periods 2000 through 2005.
Through 2005,
we applied Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related interpretations, and provided
the required pro forma disclosures under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, and
SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition and Disclosure.
Under APB No25, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense was
recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market
price on the actual grant date. Because each of the options identified below
other than those which we have determined should be accounted for variably
was deemed to have an exercise price below the market price on the appropriate
measurement date, we should have recognized a charge for each of those options
under APB No25, in an amount equal to the number of shares covered by
such options, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the
market price on the appropriate measurement date. That expense should have been
amortized over the vesting periods of the options. Starting in 2006, we adopted
SFAS No123R, Share-Based Payment. As a result, for 2006, the
additional stock-based compensation expense required to be recorded for each of
the options identified below was equal to the incremental fair value of those
options on the appropriate measurement date over the remaining vesting periods
of those options. We did not record such stock-based compensation expenses
under APB No25 or SFAS No123R in our previously issued
financial statements, and that is the reason for the restatement in this
report. To correct our past accounting for stock options, we recorded
additional pre-tax, non-cash, stock-based compensation expense of
a$117million for the periods 1997 to 2005 under APB No25
and bthe remaining $04million for 2006 under SFAS No123R.
The fair value of the options is being recorded using the accelerated
amortization method under FIN 28 over the respective vesting periods of the
awards.
Consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from
the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, the Company has organized the
grants with respect to which an accounting adjustment is required into
categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized. Based
on the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company applied the relevant accounting
standards to determine the measurement date for every grant within each
category. The Company recorded accounting adjustments as required, resulting in
stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. The Company organized
the grants where adjustments were required as follows Company-wide option grants where optionees were added or grant amounts
were changed after the option list was complete, or where insufficient
contemporaneous documentation of the grant date exists. For seven Company-wide refresh and
retention grants made between 1998 and 2003, the Company determined that some
employees who were omitted from the option grant list were added to the list
after the stated grant date, and that the number of shares covered by option
grants to some employees was not finally determined until after the stated
grant date. Further, in 2001 and 2002,  69  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued insufficient
contemporaneous documentation of the stated grant date existed. As a result of
these issues, the Company restated its historical financial statements to
increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately $63million,
recognized over the vesting periods of the relevant options.
Re-priced options. In August2002, after consideration
of relevant information, the Compensation Committee rescinded its April2002
grant, and its June2002 grant, to executives and other key employees. The
Company thereafter reissued the grants in August2002. At the time, in
consultation with our external advisors, we determined that these transactions did
not require variable accounting. As a result of the Special Committee review of
our historical stock option practices, we have reassessed the circumstances
surrounding these transactions with our external advisors and have determined
that the grants should have been accounted for variably. As a result, the
Company restated its historical financial statements to increase stock-based
compensation expense by a cumulative net amount of approximately $38million,
recognized over the vesting periods of these options.
Acquisition-related options. The Company determined a grant
given to retain employees hired in connection with an acquisition in October2000
should have been accounted for variably. As a result, the Company restated its
historical financial statements to increase stock-based compensation expense by
approximately $03million, recognized over the vesting periods of these
options.
Improper measurement dates for non-refresh stock option
grants. The
Company revised the measurement dates for certain
grants made to new hires and for promotional and other miscellaneous
non-refresh grants made between 1997 and 2003 as a result of approvals that
were obtained subsequent to the stated grant dates or as a result of
administrative delays or errors and a small number of stock option grants to
non-executives that were determined to have been established retrospectively.
As a result, the Company restated its historical financial statements to
increase stock-based compensation expense by approximately $13million,
recognized over the vesting periods of these options.
In the
aggregate, we have recorded additional stock-based compensation expense for the
periods 1997 through 2005 of approximately $117million on stock option
grants made from 1997 through 2003. 70  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued The incremental impact from recognizing stock-based compensation
expense resulting from the investigation of past stock option grants is as

$1564million to $1654million, and decreased total stockholders
equity by $07million from $5343million to $5336million.
All the restatements of financial statements, financial data and related
disclosures described in this report are collectively referred to in this
report as the restatements.
In December2006,
the Company amended options to purchase approximately 218,000shares of
common stock held by Dr.Gerzberg and Mr.Schneider to increase the
exercise price of those options to the fair market value of the Companys
common stock on the revised measurement date so that these options are no
longer subject to a penalty tax under IRC Section409A.
We have not
amended, and we do not intend to amend, any of our previously filed Annual
Reports on Form10-K. We have amended our Quarterly Report for the
period ended March31, 2006 concurrent with the filing of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, and we do not intend to amend any of our other previously
filed Quarterly Reports on Form10-Q for the periods affected by the
restatements. We present restated quarterly financial information for each of
the quarters in 2006 and 2005 in Selected Quarterly Financial Information
Unaudited included in this report.
The impact of
the restatements on the interim periods of each of the first three quarters of
2006 and each of the quarters of 2005 are disclosed in Selected Quarterly
Financial Information Unaudited included in this report. 71  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Restatement and Impact on Financial Statements

In addition,
the Company evaluated the impact of the restatements on its global tax
provision. The Company and its subsidiaries file tax returns in multiple tax
jurisdictions around the world. In certain jurisdictions, including, but not
limited to, the United States and Israel, the Company is able to claim a tax
deduction relative to stock options. In those jurisdictions, where a tax
deduction is claimed, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets relative to
the book compensation now recorded on the restated options. As with our other
deferred tax assets, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on all
deferred tax assets relating to restated options. The Company also believes
that it should not have taken a United States tax deduction of
$06million in prior years for stock option related amounts pertaining to
certain executives under Internal Revenue Code IRC Section162m which
limits the deductibility of compensation above certain thresholds. The deferred
tax asset and related valuation allowance have been adjusted accordingly. The
cumulative tax effect of all components of the restatements for 1997 to 2005 is
an increase in tax expense of $200,000.
On February27,
2007, the Company elected to: iparticipate in the Internal Revenue
Service remediation program 2007-18 and pay to the IRS, on behalf of
affected and eligible employees not including executive officers, their IRC
409A tax liabilities and penalties; iiparticipate in any similar
remediation program that may be offered by any state for applicable state tax
liabilities and penalties; iii act directly with any state not offering a
similar remediation program to address any applicable tax liabilities and
penalties on behalf of employees; and ivpay to such employees a gross-up
payment to offset the associated federal and state income tax consequences. The
Company took this action because the vast majority of the holders of stock
options issued by the Company that are now subject to re-measurement as a
result of the  72  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Companys
option investigation were not involved in or aware of the stock option pricing
determination. Employees who exercised such options in 2006, other than
executive officers at the time of option grant or entering into this program,
will participate in this program. The Company estimates that the total cash
payments needed to deal with the adverse tax consequences of previously
exercised discount priced options granted to non-officers will be approximately
$08million, which is expected to be recorded in 2007.
In addition,
the Company may consider taking action to minimize the adverse tax consequences
that may be incurred by the holders of unexercised discount options.
Discount-priced stock options vesting after December31, 2004 409A
Affected Options subject U.S. option holders to a penalty tax under IRC Section409A
and to similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws, as
applicable. The Company may consider offering to amend the 409A Affected
Options held by persons other than directors and executive officers to increase
the exercise prices of those options to the market price of our common stock on
the revised measurement date. The amended options would not be subject to
taxation under IRC Section409A. Under IRS regulations, the amendments for
non-executives cannot be offered until after this Report is filed and do not
need to be completed until December31, 2007. The Company may also
consider approving the payment of bonuses to holders of those amended options
to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price.
The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the Company if and
when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid but
there is no assurance that the options will be exercised. The Company has not
estimated the expense of any such bonus payments.
The
restatement adjustments did not affect the Companys previously reported cash
and cash equivalents and investments balances in prior periods. The following presents
the effect of the restatement adjustments by financial statement line item for
the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2005, Statements of

1 The restated consolidated balance sheet
for the fiscal year ended 2005 reflects a $130million increase to
accumulated deficit and a $107million increase to additional paid-in
capital primarily due to additional stock-based compensation recorded in
connection with this restatement to correct prior year stock option-related
accounting errors as described above and to reflect the cumulative impact of other
adjustments that were previously considered to be immaterial. The $16million
decrease to goodwill is the impact of recording losses associated with our
investment in Oren Semiconductor under the equity method of accounting and $08million
increase to accrued expenses and other liabilities relates to the accrual of
royalty obligations that was previously not recorded at December31, 2005. 74 ZORAN CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS in thousands, except per share data

expenses, amortization of premiums and discounts on investments, additional
expense related to options granted to a consultant and the amortization of stock-based
compensation relating to a business combination in 2003. In addition, the
Company is also recording losses under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18 APB

NOTE3SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Zoran has
adopted accounting policies which are generally accepted in the industry in
which it operates. The following is a summary of the Companys significant
accounting policies.
Use of estimates
The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the Unites States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from
those estimates, although such differences are not expected to be material to
the consolidated financial statements.
Translation of foreign currencies
The majority
of the Companys purchasing and sales transactions are denominated in US
dollars, which is considered to be the functional currency of the Company and
its subsidiaries. The Company has not experienced material losses or gains as a
result of currency exchange rate fluctuations and has not engaged in hedging
transactions to reduce its exposure to such fluctuations. The Company may take
action in the future to reduce its foreign exchange risk. Monetary assets and
liabilities of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S.
dollars from the local currency at rates in effect at period-end and
non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates. Revenues
and expenses are remeasured at average rates during the period. In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No52, gains and losses
arising from the remeasurement of local currency financial statements are
included in other income loss, net and have not been significant for any of
the periods presented. 77  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Revenue
recognition
The
Companys policy is to recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment,
provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed
and determinable, collectibility is reasonably assured and legal title and risk
of ownership has transferred. A provision for estimated future returns and
potential warranty liability is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. Warranty
expenses in 2006, 2005 and 2004, were immaterial. Development revenue under
development contracts is recognized as the services are performed based on the
specific deliverables outlined in each contract. Amounts received in advance of
performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized
when our obligations have been met. Costs associated with development revenues
are included primarily in research and development expenses. Revenue resulting
from the licensing of the Companys technology is recognized when significant
contractual obligations have been fulfilled and the customer has indicated
acceptance. Periodic service and maintenance fees which provide customers
access to technical support and minor enhancements to licensed releases are
recognized ratably over the service or maintenance period. Royalty revenue is
recognized in the period licensed sales are reported to the Company which
typically ranges between one month to one quarter in arrears. Revenue from
litigation settlement is recognized in accordance with the terms of the
agreement when actual cash payments are received.
Research and
development costs
Research
and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.
Cash
equivalents and investments
All
highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90days
or less are considered to be cash equivalents.
All
of the Companys investments in marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale and, therefore, are reported at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses, net of related tax, if any, included as accumulated other
comprehensive income loss, a component of stockholders equity. Gains and
losses realized upon sales of all such securities are reported in interest
income. See Note3.
When
the fair value of an investment declines below its amortized cost, the Company
considers all available evidence to evaluate whether an other-than-temporary
decline in value has occurred. Among other things, the Company considers the
duration and extent to which the market value has declined relative to our cost
basis, the economic factors influencing the markets, the relative performance
of the investee and its near-term prospects.
At
December31, 2006 and 2005, the Companys marketable securities included
corporate debt, US government securities, auction rate securities, foreign
bonds, municipal bonds and marketable equity securities. See Note4.
A significant
portion of the Companys portfolio is comprised of auction rate securities with
stated maturity dates that may be one year or more beyond the balance sheet
dates. Based on historical experience in the financial markets, the Company
believes there is a reasonable expectation of completing a successful auction
within a 12-month period.
Other assets
and investments also include investments in non-marketable securities which are
accounted for on the cost basis and amounted to $42million and $52
million at December31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company records
an investment impairment charge when the fair value of an investment  78  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued declines below
its cost basis. In making this determination the Company considers all
available evidence including the historical and projected financial performance
and recent funding events which are ascertained from an investee. The Company
recorded an investment impairment charge of $09 million in 2006. There were no
such charges in 2005.
Concentration of credit risk of financial instruments
Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments in
marketable securities, non-marketable equity securities and trade accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash in banks and cash equivalents consist
primarily of certificates of deposit and commercial paper. The Company, by
policy, limits the amount of its credit exposure through diversification and
restricting its investments to highly rated securities. Individual securities
are limited to comprising no more than 10% of the portfolio value at the time
of purchase. Highly rated securities are defined as having a minimum Moody or
Standard Poors rating of A2 or A respectively. The average maturity
of the portfolio shall not exceed 24 months. The Company has not experienced
any significant losses on its cash equivalents or short-term investments.
The Company
markets integrated circuits and technology to manufacturers and distributors of
electronic equipment primarily in North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition
and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally
does not require collateral. Management believes that any risk of loss is
significantly reduced due to the diversity of its customers and geographic
sales areas. As of December31, 2006 four customers accounted for
approximately 13%, 12%, 10% and 10% of the net accounts receivable balance,
respectively. As of December31, 2005 one customer accounted for
approximately 14% of the net accounts receivable balance.
Inventory
Inventories
are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a
first-in, first-out basis or market. Market is based on estimated net
realizable value. The Company writes down inventories to net realizable value
based on forecasted demand and market conditions. Inventory write-downs are not
reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until
such inventory is sold or scrapped.
Property and equipment
Property and
equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to five years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining term of the lease.
Goodwill
In accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Statement No142 Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets SFASNo142 goodwill is not amortized. The
Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with
acquisitions, by reporting unit, annually, or sooner if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For
each of the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company
performed the annual analysis and concluded that goodwill was not impaired, as
the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including
goodwill. 79  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Other Intangibles
Other
intangible assets were recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Oak
Technology,Inc., Emblaze Semiconductor, Ltd and Oren Semiconductor,Inc.
and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods of
benefit, which range between three and five years.
Long-lived assets
The Company
evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, other than goodwill,
whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amounts of the
assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates these assets by comparing
expected undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related assets. If
the expected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the
assets, the Company recognizes an impairment charge based on the fair value of
the assets. To date, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges
against the value of its long-lived assets.
Fair value of financial instruments
The fair value
of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be
exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. The carrying
amounts for cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
respective fair values because of the short-term maturity of these items.
Income taxes
The Company
follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires
recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax
consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The Companys
effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously
unbenefitted net operating losses which the Company has utilized for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and by our Israel based subsidiarys status as an Approved
Enterprise under Israeli law, which provides a ten-year tax holiday for income
attributable to a portion of our operations in Israel. Our U.S. federal net
operating losses expire at various times between 2017 and 2024, and the
benefits from our subsidiarys Approved Enterprise status expire at various
times beginning in 2008.
Realization of
deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future
taxable income. The valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No109 which requires an assessment of both positive
and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that
deferred tax assets are recoverable; such assessment is required on a
jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Historical operating losses and continuing
business uncertainty represent sufficient negative evidence which it was
difficult for positive evidence to overcome under SFAS No109 and
accordingly, a full valuation allowance was recorded. If the facts or estimates
of future financial results were to change, increasing the likelihood of
realizing the deferred tax assets, judgment would have to be applied to
determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period. We
intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive
evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance.
Earnings per share
In accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128, Zoran reports
Earnings per Share EPS, both basic and diluted, on the consolidated statement
of operations. Basic EPS is based  80  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued upon the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed
using the weighted average common shares outstanding plus any potential common
stock, except when their effect is anti-dilutive. Potential common stock
includes common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and
restricted stock units. See Note13.
Stock-based compensation
Effective January1,
2006, Zoran adopted SFAS No123R, using the modified prospective application
transition method, which establishes accounting for stock-based awards
exchanged for employee services. Accordingly, stock-based compensation cost is
measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, over the
requisite service period. The Company previously applied Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No25, and related interpretations and
provided the pro forma disclosures required by SFAS No123, Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No123.
Periods Prior
to the Adoption of SFAS 123R
Prior to the
adoption of SFAS No123R, the Company provided the disclosures required under
SFAS No123, as
amended by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based CompensationTransition
and Disclosures.
Had compensation cost for the Companys option and stock purchase
plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates, as prescribed
in SFASNo123, the Companys net loss and net loss per share for
each of the year ended December31, 2005 and 2004, would have been as

For purposes
of this pro forma disclosure, the value of the options was estimated using the
accelerated amortization method under FIN 28 over the respective vesting
periods of the awards. Due to the valuation allowance provided on our deferred
tax assets, the Company has not recorded any tax benefits attributable to pro
forma stock-based compensation.
The Company
provides information regarding the methodology and assumptions used for the
above pro forma disclosure in Note11. 81  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Impact of Adoption of SFAS No123R
During
the year ended December31 2006, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense for awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of January1,
2006 as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under SFAS No123 were in effect for expense
recognition purposes adjusted for estimated forfeitures. For these awards, the
Company has continued to recognize compensation expense using the accelerated
amortization method. For stock-based awards granted after January1, 2006,
the Company recognized compensation expense based on the grant date fair value
required under SFAS No123R. For these awards, the Company recognized
compensation expense using a straight-line amortization method. As SFAS No123Rrequires that stock-based
compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest,
estimated stock-based compensation for the year ended December31, 2006
has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The adoption of SFAS No123Rresulted in a one-time
benefit of $314,000 related to unvested awards for which compensation expense
had already been recorded.
The following table summarizes stock-based compensation
expense related to employee stock options, employee stock purchases and
restricted stock unit grants for the year ended December31, 2006 as

Segment
reporting
SFAS
No131 establishes standards for the reporting by public business
enterprises of information about operating segments, products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The method for determining what
information to report is based on the manner in which management organizes the
operating segments within the Company for making operational decisions and
assessments of financial performance. The Companys chief operating
decision-maker is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer.
The
Companys products are based on highly integrated application-specific
integrated circuits, or ASICs, and system-on-a-chip, or SOC, solutions. The
Company also licenses certain software and other intellectual property. During
the first quarter of 2006, the Company reorganized its operating structure to bring
together its consumer electronic product lines under a single operating group,
in recognition of the accelerating convergence of consumer products and the
Companys strategy of sharing technology among its various product lines. The
new Consumer group combines the former Digital Versatile Disc DVD, Digital
Television DTV and Mobile product groups whose operations were previously
reported separately. The Company will continue to report the operations of its
Imaging group as a separate operating segment.
The
Consumer group provides products for use in DVD players, recordable DVD
players, standard and high definition digital television products, digital
camera products and multimedia mobile phone products.  82  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued The
Imaging group provides products used in digital copiers, laser and inkjet
printers as well as multifunction peripherals.
Comprehensive Income loss
Comprehensive Income loss is defined as the change in

Recent
accounting pronouncements
In February2007, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB issued SFAS No159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This
statement expands the standards under SFAS No157, Fair Value Measurement, to provide entities the one-time
election Fair Value Option or FVO to measure financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. Most of the provisions of this statement
apply only to entities that elect the fair value option. The provisions of SFAS
No159 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning January1,
2008. The Company is evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In September2006,
the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin SABNo108, Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements. SABNo108 was issued in order
to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies
quantify financial statement misstatements. SABNo108 requires
registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both
the rollover method, which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement
on the income statement and is the method currently used by the Company, and
the iron curtain method, which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting
the period-end balance sheet. The use of both of these methods is referred to
as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of
qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with SABNo99,
Materiality. The provisions of SABNo108 are effective for the
Company for the fiscal year ended December31, 2006. The adoption of
SABNo108 did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In September2006, the FASB issued SFASNo157,
Fair Value Measurements SFAS No157, which defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. The provisions of SFAS No157 are effective for the Company
for fiscal years beginning after December31, 2007. The Company is
evaluating the impact of the provisions of this statement on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 83  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued In
September2006, the FASB issued SFASNo158, Employers
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans.
SFASNo158 requires employers to fully recognize the obligations
associated with single-employer defined benefit pension, retiree healthcare and
other post-retirement plans in their financial statements. The provisions of
SFASNo158 are effective for the Company as of the end of the
fiscal year ending December31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No158
did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
In
June2006, the FASB published FIN48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No109 which clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises
financial statements in accordance with SFAS No109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. This Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This Interpretation
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. This
Interpretation is effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning January1,
2007. The impact of the provisions of this Interpretation on the Companys
retained earnings is expected to be less than $5million.
In
February2006, the FASB issued SFAS No155, Accounting for Certain
Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of SFAS No133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and SFAS No140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities. This Statement permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would
require bifurcation. This Statement is effective for the Company for all
financial instruments acquired or issued after July1, 2007. The adoption
of SFAS No155 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In
June2005, the FASB issued SFAS No154, Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections, a replacement of APB No20, Accounting Changes, and
SFAS No3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements.
SFAS No154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting
of a change in accounting principle. Previously, most voluntary changes in
accounting principles required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment
within net income of the period of the change. SFAS No154 requires
retrospective application to prior periods financial statements, unless it is
impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
effect of the change. SFAS No154 is effective for the Company for
accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning January1, 2006;
however, the Statement does not change the transition provisions of any
existing accounting pronouncements. The adoption of SFAS No154 did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.
In March2005,
the FASB published FIN47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations, which clarifies that the term, conditional asset retirement
obligation, as used in SFAS No143, Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations, refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity
in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future
event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. The uncertainty
about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset
retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability
when sufficient information exists. The Interpretation also clarifies when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value
of an asset retirement obligation. The adoption of this Interpretation did not
have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. 84 ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued

a party to certain research and development agreements with the Chief Scientist
in Israels Ministry of Industry and Trade Department the Chief Scientist
and the Israel-United States Binational Industrial Research and
Development Foundation BIRDF, which fund up to 50% of incurred project
costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums. The Company is
not obligated to repay funding regardless of the outcome of its development
efforts; however, these agreements require the Company to use its best efforts
to achieve specified results and require the Company to pay royalties at rates
of 3% to 5% of resulting products sales, and up to 30% of resulting license
revenues, up to a maximum of 100% to 150% of the total funding received. Reported
research and development expenses incurred in Israel are net of these grants,
which fluctuate from period to period.

NOTE8DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS
The Company
has generated a portion of its total revenues from development contracts,
primarily with key customers. The Company classifies costs related to these
development contracts as research and development expenses. The Company is not
obligated to repay funding regardless of the outcome of its development
efforts; however, the agreements require the Company to use its best efforts to
achieve specified results as per the agreements. The Company retains ownership
of the intellectual property developed under the contracts; however, some
contracts limit the product markets in which the Company may directly sell the
developed product. Revenues generated under these contracts were $27million
in 2006; $32million in 2005 and $16million in 2004. In addition,
from time to time, we enter into non-refundable joint development projects in
which our customers reimburse us for a portion of our development costs. We
classify such reimbursement of development costs as an offset to research and
development expenses as we retain ownership of the intellectual property
developed by us under these development arrangements. During 2006 and 2005, we
received approximately $370,000 and $12million in such reimbursements. We
did not receive any reimbursements in 2004.
NOTE9COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to
time, the Company may have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the
ordinary course of its business activities. The Company accrues contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can be reasonably estimated. 88  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Lease and license commitments
The Company rents facilities under various lease agreements
expiring through 2016. Rent expense for 2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled

Legal proceedings
U.S.
Attorney and SEC Investigations:On July3, 2006, Zoran disclosed in a press release
that it received a grand jury subpoena from the office of the U.S. attorney for
the Northern District of California requesting documents from 1995 through the
present referring to, relating to or involving stock options, and also received
an informal inquiry from the SEC requesting documents related to Zorans stock
option grants. Zoran intends to cooperate fully in all government
investigations. These inquiries likely will require the Company to expend
significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses, and
could result in civil and criminal actions seeking, among other things,
injunctions against the Company and its officers and directors and the payment
of significant fines and penalties by the Company and its officers and
directors, which may adversely affect its results of operations and cash flow. The
Company cannot predict how long it will take to or how much more time and
resources it will have to expend to resolve these government inquiries, nor can
it predict the outcome of these inquiries. Also, there can be no assurance that
other inquiries, investigations or actions will not be started by other United
States federal or state regulatory agencies or by foreign governmental
agencies.
Late
SEC Filings and Nasdaq Delisting ProceedingsDue to the Special Committee
investigation and the resulting restatements, the Company did not file on time
its Quarterly Report on Form10-Q for the quarters ended June30,
2006 and September30, 2006, or its Annual Report on Form10-K for
the year ended December31, 2006. As a result, the Company received Nasdaq
Staff Determination letters, dated August14, 2006, November15, 2006
and March20, 2007 stating that the Company was not in compliance with the
filing requirements of Marketplace Rule4310c14 and, therefore, that
the Companys stock was subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select
Market. A hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel was held on September27,
2006 and a decision to grant the Companys request for continued listing on
Nasdaq subject to certain conditions occurred on December28, 2006. The
Company has appealed this decision, and the Nasdaq Listing Council has
determined to stay the December28, 2006 Panel decision, and any future
Panel determinations to suspend Zorans securities from trading, pending
further action from the Listing Council. On March2, 2007, the Company
provided the Listing Council with an additional submission for its
consideration regarding continued listing. The Listing Council will review the
matter on the basis of the written record. 89  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Shareholder Class
Actions and Derivative Litigation Relating to Historical Stock Option
Practices:As discussed further below, certain persons and entities identifying themselves as
shareholders of Zoran have filed litigation purporting to assert claims arising
out of the historical accounting for stock options.
Zucker v.
Zoran Corporation, et al.On August10, 2006, a securities class action
complaint was filed against Zoran and certain of its officers and directors in
the United States District Court, Northern District of California, alleging
violations of federal securities laws. The Court selected Middlesex Pension
Fund as lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiffs selection of counsel for
the class. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on February1, 2007 and a
second amended complaint on February20, 2007. On March8, 2007,
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On March20, 2007, lead plaintiff
filed a notice voluntarily dismissing the action with prejudice as to the lead
plaintiff.
NCEA-IBEW
Pension Fund The Decatur Plan v. Galil, et al.On June 12, 2006, a purported shareholder
derivative action was filed by the Decatur Plan against Zoran as a nominal
defendant and certain of its officers and directors in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, alleging, inter alia,
violations of federal and state securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty.
On December4, 2006, Decatur Plan filed a notice of voluntary dismissal.
Pfeiffer v.
Zoran Corporation et al.On September 7, 2006, a purported shareholder derivative
action was filed by Milton Pfeiffer against Zoran as a nominal defendant and
certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California, alleging, inter alia, violations of federal
securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duties.
Gerald del
Rosario v. Aharon et al.On September 26, 2006, a purported shareholder derivative
action was filed by Gerald del Rosario against Zoran as a nominal defendant and
certain of its current and former officers and directors in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, alleging, inter alia,
violations of federal securities laws and breaches of fiduciary duty. On December
8, 2006, the Court issued an order consolidating the Del Rosario
action with the Pfeiffer action. The Court
selected del Rosario as lead plaintiff and approved lead plaintiffs selection
of counsel for the consolidated derivative action. Plaintiffs filed a
consolidated amended complaint on March 14, 2007.
Barone v.
Gerzberg et al.; Durco v. Gerzberg et al.On October23, 2006, two purported
shareholder derivative actions were filed by Moshe Barone and John Durco
against Zoran as a nominal defendant and certain of its current and former
officers and directors in the California Superior Court of Santa Clara County,
alleging, inter alia, violations of state securities laws and breaches of
fiduciary duty. On January24, 2007 the Court consolidated the Barone and Durco actions,
appointed Messrs.Barone and Durco as co-lead plaintiffs and approved
their selection of counsel for the consolidated derivative action. Co-Lead
Plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on March26, 2007.
On February 20, 2007, the Company filed a complaint against
ArcSoft Inc. in the California Superior Court for the County of Alameda,
seeking payment of $4 million in principal, together with accrued interest then
in the amount of approximately $525,000, under four separate convertible
promissory notes. On February 28, 2007,
the Company filed an application with the Court seeking to attach assets of
ArcSoft as security for the payment of its obligations under the notes. The notes represent amounts loaned by the
Company to ArcSoft in 2004 in connection with a transaction involving the
transfer to ArcSoft of rights related to a software product then under
development and related agreements regarding the continued development and
commercialization of the product. On
March 28, 2007, ArcSoft filed an answer denying liability under the notes and
asserting various affirmative defenses.
ArcSoft also filed a cross complaint alleging fraud in the inducement of
the business arrangement, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, breach of
contract and of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust
enrichment and  90  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued seeking monetary damages of more than $69 million. The hearing on our application for an
attachment is currently scheduled for May 14, 2007.
Indemnification
Obligations.Subject to certain
limitations, the Company is obligated to indemnify its current and former
directors, officers and employees in connection with the investigation of the
Companys historical stock option practices and related government inquiries
and litigation. These obligations arise under the terms of the Companys
certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, applicable contracts, and Delaware
and California law. The obligation to indemnify generally means that the
Company is required to pay or reimburse the individuals reasonable legal
expenses and possibly damages and other liabilities incurred in connection with
these matters. The Company is currently paying or reimbursing legal expenses
being incurred in connection with these matters by a number of its current and
former directors, officers and employees. Although the maximum potential amount
of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements
is theoretically unlimited, the Company believes the fair value of this
liability is adequately covered within the reserves it has established for
currently pending legal proceedings.
Other Legal Matters.The
Company is named from time to time as a party to lawsuits in the normal course
of its business. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and
securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal
business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings are difficult
to predict.
NOTE 10RESTRUCTURING
During the year ended December31, 2004, the
Company recorded restructuring charges of $746,000 due to the discontinuation
of the Sensor product line of the Consumer operating segment. These charges

severance and other termination expenses, $173,000 for lease losses on
abandoned office space and other miscellaneous legal and consulting fees of approximately
$50,000. The remaining balance at December31, 2006 of approximately
$52,000 related to facilities will be paid over the lease term through
June2007.

of awards under the 2005 Plan may similarly be based on the attainment of one
or more such performance goals. The 2005 Plan provides that the number of
shares remaining available for issuance will be reduced by 13 shares for each
one share of Zoran common stock subject to a full value award granted under the
2005 Plan.

received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options
as of that date. The total number of shares of common stock underlying
in-the-money options exercisable as of December31, 2006 was 33million. 94  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued The total intrinsic value of options exercised during
the year ended December31, 2006 was $408million. The total cash
received from employees as a result of employee stock option exercises during

As of December31, 2006, the total unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock options was $84million after
estimated forfeitures which are expected to be recognized over an estimated
amortization period of up to four years.

Restricted
Shares and Restricted Stock Units
Restricted shares and restricted stock units are
granted under the 2005 Plan. On January6, 2006, the Company filed a
Tender Offer Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
commenced an offer to current employees to exchange outstanding options with
exercise prices per share that were  95  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued more than the greater of $2000 and the closing sale
price of Zoran common stock on the offer expiration date of February6,
2006. The exchange offer was approved by Zorans stockholders at their 2005
annual meeting. On February6, 2006, the Company accepted for exchange
options to purchase an aggregate of 1,060,536 shares of Zoran common stock
having an exercise price greater than $2248. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the exchange, the Company granted 197,433 restricted shares of
common stock or restricted stock units in exchange for the tendered options. The
shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted as part of this
exchange vest over a period of two years. None of the directors or executive
officers was eligible for participation in the exchange offer. This exchange
was accounted as a modification under FAS No123R. As of December31,
2006, there was $03million of total unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense related to restricted shares and restricted stock units.
This cost is expected to be recognized over the vesting period of two to four
years.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan
The Companys 1995
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP was adopted by the Companys Board of
Directors in October1995, and approved by its stockholders in
December1995. The ESPP enables employees to purchase shares through
payroll deductions at approximately 85% of the lesser of the fair value of
common stock at the beginning of a 24-month offering period or the end of
each six-month segment within such offering period. The ESPP is intended to
qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section423 of the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code. During the years
ended December31, 2006 and 2005, 263,349 and 488,313 shares were
purchased by employees under the terms of the plan agreements at a weighted
average price of $916 and $890 per share, respectively. As of
December31, 2006, 2,311,447 shares were reserved and available for
issuance under this plan. Due to the delay in the filing of its periodic
reports during 2006, the Company was unable to issue shares under the ESPP for
the six-month segment ended October31, 2006.
NOTE12RETIREMENT
AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
We maintain a 401kPlan that covers
substantially all of the Companys US employees. Participants may elect to
contribute a percentage of their compensation to this plan, up to the statutory
maximum amount prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has the
ability to make a discretionary matching contribution to the 401kPlan
based on a uniform percentage of the employees eligible contribution up to a
maximum employer match of $2,000 per year per employee. Approximately $525,000 235,000 and $384,000 in matching contributions were recorded during 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. 96 ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued
Under Israeli law, the Company is required to make
severance payments to its retired or dismissed Israeli employees and Israeli
employees leaving its employment in certain other circumstances. The Companys
severance pay liability to its Israeli employees, which is calculated based on
the salary of each employee multiplied by the years of such employees
employment, is reflected in the Companys balance sheet in other long-term
liabilities on an accrual basis, and is partially funded by the purchase of
insurance policies in the name of the employees. The surrender value of the
insurance policies is recorded in other non-current assets. The severance pay
expenses for the years ended December31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were
$979,000, $645,000 and $412,000 respectively. The severance pay detail is as

$
A significant portion of the deferred tax asset above
relates to pre-acquisition loss carryforwards and other attributes or stock
option benefits that will result in an adjustment to goodwill or paid in
capital respectively, when realized. During 2006, the Company realized $71
million related to certain pre-acquisition tax net operating losses. Realization
of these net operating losses is reported as an adjustment to goodwill in
accordance with SFAS No109. During 2006 we reduced the NOL deferred tax
asset for  98  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued amounts which we believe will expire before they become
available for utilization. As of December31, 2006, the Company had NOLs
of approximately $185 million for federal and $36 million for state tax
reporting purposes. The federal NOLs expire on various dates between 2017 and
2024. The state NOLs expire between 2012 and 2014. Approximately $45 million of
the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions,
for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded. As of December31,
2006, the Company had tax credits of approximately $23 million for federal and
$19 million for state tax purposes, which will expire beginning in 2007.
Realization of deferred tax assets is based on our
ability to generate sufficient future taxable income. The valuation allowance
was determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No109 which
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining
whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable;
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. Historical
operating results and continuing business uncertainty represent sufficient
negative evidence which it was difficult for positive evidence to overcome
under SFAS No109 and accordingly, a full valuation allowance was
recorded. The amount of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, however,
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are
realized. The calculation of the Companys
tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of
complex tax regulations. The Company records liabilities for anticipated tax
audit issues based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which,
additional taxes may be due. Actual tax liabilities may be different than the
recorded estimates and could result in an additional charge or benefit to the
tax provision in the period when the ultimate tax assessment is determined.
The Company has not provided for federal income tax on
approximately $556 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries
since the Company intends to reinvest this amount outside the U.S. indefinitely.
If the Company did not intend to permanently reinvest this amount outside the U.S.,
it would calculate a deferred tax liability of approximately $195 million
related to the U.S. taxes that would be due upon repatriation.
The Companys Israeli
subsidiary has been granted the status of an Approved Enterprise pursuant to
the Israeli law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959, as amended.
The Company has eight approved programs pursuant to this law; the first was
approved in 1984 and the most recent was approved in 2004. Income subject to
this program is exempt from tax for two/four years from the first year in which
the Company has taxable income, net of NOLs, and is taxed at a rate of 10% for
eight/six years thereafter. Benefits under the programs are granted for a
period of ten years limited to the earlier of fourteen years from application
or twelve years from commencement of production. Benefits for the eighth
program will expire on 2014. The benefit of these Approved Enterprise programs
to the Companys net income in 2006 was $78 million and resulted in a benefit
of $57 million to the net loss in 2005. These tax holidays had no impact to
the Companys net loss in 2004.
NOTE15SEGMENT
REPORTING
SFAS No131 establishes standards for the
reporting by public business enterprises of information about operating
segments, products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The
method for determining what information to report is based on the way that
management organizes the operating segments within the Company for making
operational decisions and assessments of financial performance. The Companys
chief operating decision-maker is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer. 99  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Subsequent to the acquisition of Oak Technology,Inc.
in 2003, the Company determined it had four reportable segments: Digital Versatile
Disc DVD, Imaging, Digital Camera DC and Digital Television DTV. Subsequent
to the Emblaze acquisition in July2004, the Digital Camera segment was
combined with the Emblaze Mobile business unit and was renamed the Mobile
segment. Each segments primary products are based on highly integrated
application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and system-on-a-chip, or
SOC, solutions. The DVD, DTV, Mobile and Imaging segments also license certain
software and other intellectual property. The DVD group provides products for
use in DVD players and recordable DVD players. The DTV group provides products
for standard and high definition digital television products including
televisions, set top boxes and personal video recorders. The Mobile group
focuses on solutions for multimedia mobile phone products and digital camera
products. The Imaging group provides products used in digital copiers, laser
and inkjet printers as well as multifunction peripherals.
During the first quarter of 2006, we reorganized our
operating structure to bring together our consumer electronic product lines
under a single operating group, in recognition of the accelerating convergence
of consumer products and our strategy of sharing technology among our various
product lines. The new Consumer group combines the former DVD, DTV and Mobile
product groups whose operations were previously reported separately. We will
continue to report the operations of our Imaging group as a separate operating
segment.
The Company evaluates operating segment performance
based on net revenues and operating expenses of these segments. The accounting
policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of accounting policies. No reportable segments have been aggregated.

NOTE 16ACQUISITIONS
Oren Semiconductor,Inc.
On June10,
2005, Zoran completed the acquisition of Oren Semiconductor,Inc. Oren,
a privately-held provider of demodulator ICs for the global high definition
television market. Prior to this acquisition, Zoran had made investments in
Oren that represented a 17% ownership interest with a net book value of $34
million at the time of the acquisition. Under the terms of the acquisition
agreement, Zoran acquired  102  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued the remaining
83% of Orens outstanding stock by means of a merger of Oren with a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Zoran, in consideration for which Zoran paid an
aggregate of $284million in cash and issued 1,188,061 shares of Zoran
common stock valued at $129million, for total consideration of $413million,
to the other stockholders of Oren and to employees holding Oren options. As a
result of the restatement, the Company considered the requirements under Accounting
Principles Board Opinion 18 APB No18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock, to record the gains or losses on investment of the prior 17%
ownership under the equity method of accounting. Based on the Companys
analysis, the prior financial results of the Company were restated to record the
loss on investment.
The primary
purpose of the acquisition was to obtain Orens demodulator IC technology for
the global high definition television market. This technology was combined with
Zorans digital television technology to deliver a complete and cost-effective
system solution for digital television makers. As of December 31, 2006, there
have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used
in the original computation of the value of the acquired entity.
The
transaction was accounted for under SFAS No141, Business Combinations,
using the purchase method of accounting. The Company incurred approximately
$375,000 for acquisition-related expenses consisting of financial advisory,
legal and other consulting services. The Company completed a valuation analysis
and purchase price allocation. The results of operations of Oren have been
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
The acquisition resulted in goodwill of approximately $339million. In accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for
impairment at least annually. The Company does not expect goodwill to be
deductible for tax purposes.

Tangible assets were valued at estimates of their current fair values. The
purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired resulting in the recognition of
goodwill and other intangible assets. The amounts allocated to intangible
assets include purchased technology totaling $70million, trade name and
other intangible assets totaling $125million and customer base totaling
$850,000 which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five
years.
Approximately
$27million of the purchase price was allocated to in-process research
and development which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was immediately expensed upon
the acquisition date. This amount was determined using managements estimates
including consultation with an independent appraiser. The value of the
in-process research and development was determined using a discounted cash flow
method and factors including projected financial results, relative risk of
successful development, time-value of money and level of completion. 103  ZORAN CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued Emblaze Semiconductor Ltd.
On July8,
2004, Zoran acquired Emblaze Semiconductor Ltd. Emblaze, a subsidiary of
Emblaze Ltd. and a provider of semiconductor-based solutions for high volume
manufacturers of multimedia mobile telephones. Under the terms of the
agreement, Zorans wholly-owned Israel based subsidiary, Zoran Microelectronics
Ltd., acquired all of the outstanding common shares of Emblaze for
approximately $542million in cash.
The primary
purpose of the acquisition was to gain high performance, low-power application
processors, technology and products for the fast growing multimedia mobile
phone market. This technology was combined with Zorans image processing
technology to deliver reliable, cost-effective system solutions for mobile
phone makers. As of December 31, 2006, there have been no material variations
from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of
the value of the acquired entity.
The
transaction was accounted for under SFAS No141, Business Combinations,
using the purchase method of accounting. The Company incurred approximately
$180,000 for acquisition-related expenses consisting of financial advisory,
legal and other consulting services. The Company completed a valuation analysis
and purchase price allocation with the assistance of a third party appraiser. The
results of operations of Emblaze have been included in the consolidated
financial statements from the date of acquisition. The acquisition resulted in
goodwill of approximately $309million. In
accordance with SFASNo142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, goodwill will not be amortized and will be tested for impairment at
least annually. The Company does not expect goodwill to be deductible for tax
purposes.

NOTE 17SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February27,
2007, the Company elected to iparticipate in the Internal Revenue
Service remediation program 2007-18 and pay to the IRS, on behalf of
affected and eligible employees not including executive officers, their IRC
409A tax liabilities and penalties; iiparticipate in any similar
remediation program that may be offered by any state for applicable state tax
liabilities and penalties; iii, act directly with any state not offering a
similar remediation program to address any applicable tax liabilities and
penalties on behalf of employees; and ivpay to such employees a gross-up
payment to offset the associated federal and state income tax consequences. The
Company took this action because the vast majority of the holders of stock
options issued by the Company that are now subject to re-measurement as a
result of the Companys option investigation were not involved in or aware of
the stock option pricing determination. Employees who exercised such options in
2006, other than executive officers at the time of option grant or entering
into this program, will participate in this program. The Company estimates that
the total cash payments needed to deal with the adverse tax consequences of previously
exercised discount priced options granted to non-officers will be approximately
$08million, which is expected to be recorded in 2007.
In addition,
the Company may consider taking action to minimize the adverse tax consequences
that may be incurred by the holders of unexercised discount options.
Discount-priced stock options vesting after December31, 2004 409A
Affected Options subject U.S. option holders to a penalty tax under IRC Section409A
and to similar penalty taxes under California and other state tax laws, as
applicable. The Company may consider offering to amend the 409A Affected
Options held by persons other than directors and executive officers to increase
the exercise prices of those options to the market price of our common stock on
the revised measurement date. The amended options would not be subject to
taxation under IRC Section409A. Under IRS regulations, the amendments for
non-executives cannot be offered until after this Report is filed and do not
need to be completed until December31, 2007. The Company may also
consider approving the payment of bonuses to holders of those amended options
to compensate them for the resulting increase in their option exercise price.
The amount of these bonuses would be effectively repaid to the Company if and
when the options are exercised and the increased exercise price is paid but
there is no assurance that the options will be exercised. The Company has not
estimated the expense of any such bonus payments. 105 The following tables contain
selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the eight fiscal quarters in
the period ended December 31, 2006. In managements opinion, the unaudited data
has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all
adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a
fair presentation of the data for the periods presented. Our results of
operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter
to quarter. The results of operations in any period should not be considered
indicative of the results to be expected from any future period.
The selected quarterly information
has been restated for all quarters of fiscal 2005 and the first quarter of
fiscal 2006 from previously reported information filed on Form 10-Q and Form
10-K, as a result of the restatement of our financial results discussed in this

Disclosure Controls
and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of
the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of its disclosure
controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15e and 15d-15e under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
December 31, 2006. The Companys disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we
file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely discussions
regarding required disclosures.
Managements Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP,
and includes those policies and procedures that 1. pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company 2. provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and
expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
management and directors; and
3. provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
evaluation using criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.
Our managements assessment of the effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein. 115 Managements Consideration of the Restatement
As disclosed in Note 2, Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements, to our consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we restated previously issued
financial statements to record incremental non-cash stock based compensation
charges under APB No. 25 in the amount of $117 million between 1997 and 2005
and an additional $04 million in 2006 under SFAS No123R. These
accounting errors arose from the use of incorrect stock option grant
measurement dates for grants made during the period 1997 to 2003. 
In coming to the conclusion that our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were
effective as of December 31, 2006, management considered control deficiencies
related to the stock option granting process that resulted in the need to
restate our previously issued financial statements.
During fiscal year
2004 in compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Company implemented
improved procedures, processes and systems to provide additional safeguards and
greater internal control over its stock option granting and administration.
These improvements included Segregating
responsibilities, adding reviews and reconciliations, and redefining roles and
responsibilities in the human resources function Upgrading
systems and system controls that support the grant process and improving the
accuracy and timeliness of accounting for grants, including robust
documentation of grant approvals and usage of a hosted stock administration
system; and
Obtaining
and training more qualified competent individuals in the human resources and
stock administration function.
The Company believes that these changes remediated the
historical control deficiency. Consequently, the stock option grant process did
not constitute a control deficiency as of December 31, 2006.
Changes to Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companys internal control over financial reporting.
