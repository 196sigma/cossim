REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
of Brooks Automation, Inc. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the
accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Brooks Automation, Inc. and its subsidiaries at September 30, 1996
and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended September 30, 1996, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above. s/ PRICE WATERHOUSE LLP Price Waterhouse LLP

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF BUSINESS
Brooks Automation, Inc. the Company is a leading, worldwide independent
developer, manufacturer and supplier of vacuum central wafer and substrate
handling systems and modules for the semiconductor process equipment and flat
panel display manufacturing industries.
A summary of the Company significant accounting policies follows PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.
On February 28, 1996, the Company acquired Techware Systems Corporation
Techware, a designer and supplier of integrated equipment control software
for the semiconductor and related industries. Techware now operates as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company under the name of Brooks Automation
Canada. The acquisition of Techware has been accounted for as a pooling of
interests, and therefore the accompanying consolidated financial statements for
all periods prior to the Techware acquisition have been retroactively restated
to reflect the combination of the operations and the accounts of Techware with
those of the Company.
Due to the previously differing year-ends of the Company and Techware,
Techware results of operations for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994
have been combined with the Company results of operations for the years ended
September 30, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The results of operations for fiscal
1996 are for the twelve-months ended September 30, 1996 for both the Company and
Techware. Techware financial position as of December 31, 1995 has been
combined with the Company financial position as of September 30, 1995.
Accordingly, Techware unaudited results of operations for the three months
ended December 31, 1995 Note 2 are included in the consolidated statement of
income for both the year ended September 30, 1996 and 1995. Therefore, an amount
equal to Techware net income for the three months ended December 31, 1995 was
eliminated from consolidated retained earnings for the year ended September 30,
1996.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue from product sales is recorded upon shipment to the customer provided
that no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable
is probable. When insignificant obligations remain after shipment of the
product, the Company accrues the estimated costs of such obligations upon
shipment. A provision for product warranty costs is recorded at the time of
sale.
28
BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Company invests its excess cash in repurchase agreements with major banks
and U.S. government securities that are subject to minimal credit and market
risk. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At September
30, 1996 and 1995, cash and cash equivalents include $1,758,000 and $15,100,000,
respectively, of securities which are classified as held to maturity and for
which cost approximates fair value.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined
using the first-in, first-out method. The Company provides inventory reserves
for excess, obsolete, or damaged inventory based on changes in customer demand,
technology, and other economic factors. While the Company often uses sole
source suppliers for certain key components and common assemblies to achieve
quality control and the benefits of economies of scale, the Company believes
that these parts and materials are readily available from several supply
sources.
FIXED ASSETS
Fixed assets are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful
lives using the straight-line method. Equipment held under capital leases is
recorded at the lower of the fair market value of the equipment or the present
value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the leases. Leasehold
improvements and equipment held under capital leases are amortized over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the respective leases.
Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
PATENTS
The Company capitalizes the direct costs associated with obtaining patents.
Capitalized patent costs are amortized using the straight-line method over six
years, the estimated economic life of the patents.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Costs incurred in the research and development of the Company products are
expensed as incurred, except for certain software development costs. Software
development costs are expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility
and capitalized thereafter until the related product is available for general
release to customers. Capitalized software development costs are amortized to
cost of sales on a product-by-product basis over the estimated lives of the
related products
STOCK COMPENSATION
The Company stock compensation plans are accounted for in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees. In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-based
Compensation SFAS123, which establishes a fair-value based method of
accounting for stock-based compensation plans. The new standard allows companies
to continue to apply the intrinsic value method based on APB No. 25 provided
certain pro forma disclosures are made as if the fair-value-based method had
been applied. The Company will be required to implement SFAS123 in fiscal 1997
and intends to adopt this standard through the pro forma disclosure method.
INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Under this method,
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences, utilizing current tax rates, of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. Deferred income tax expense represents the change in the net
deferred tax asset and liability balances.

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOREIGN CURRENCY
The functional currency of the Company international subsidiaries is the local
currency. Accordingly, foreign currency financial statements of the Company
international subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates
in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average rates during
the period for results of operations. The resulting foreign currency
translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of consolidated
stockholders' equity.
NET INCOME PER SHARE
Net income per share is determined by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares and common equivalent shares assumed
outstanding during the period. Pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 83, certain common and common equivalent shares
issued by the Company during the twelve month period prior to the initial filing
of the registration statement relating to the Company initial public offering
have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares, using the
treasury stock method and an estimated initial public offering price of $900
per share, as if these shares were outstanding for all periods prior to the
initial public offering. 2. ACQUISITION

BROOKS AUTOMATION, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On July 25, 1996, the Board of Directors determined that certain stock options
issued to employees of the Company had an exercise price significantly higher
than the fair market value of the Company common stock. In light of the
Board conclusions that such options were not providing the desired incentive,
the Board provided employees with the opportunity to exchange options previously
granted to them under the 1992 Plan for new options the Replacement Options
to purchase the same number of shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$1100 per share, the then fair market value of the Company common stock.
Employees were given the choice of retaining their existing options, with the
original vesting schedule, or accepting the Replacement Options, with a vesting
schedule commencing on July 25, 1996. The Company canceled and replaced options
to purchase 344,600 shares of common stock with an average exercise price of
$1436 per share.
1995 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
On February 22, 1996, the stockholders approved the 1995 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan the 1995 Plan which enables eligible employees to purchase shares of
the Company common stock. Under the 1995 Plan, eligible employees may
purchase up to an aggregate of 150,000 shares during six-month offering periods
commencing on January 1 and July 1 of each year at a price per share of 85% of
the lower of the market price per share on the first or last day of each six-
month offering period. Participating employees may elect to have up to 10% of
base pay withheld and applied toward the purchase of such shares. The rights of
participating employees under the 1995 Plan terminate upon voluntary withdrawal
from the plan at any time or upon termination of employment. The Company has
reserved 128,607 shares of common stock for issuance under the 1995 Plan.
RESTRICTED STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
Prior to its initial public offering, the Company had an informal stock purchase
plan whereby selected key employees and consultants have been granted the
opportunity to purchase common stock. The shares of common stock sold pursuant
to this plan are generally subject to purchase by the Company at the original
purchase price plus a specified interest rate, if the individual ceases to be
employed or associated with the Company after various specified periods of time.
In connection with this plan, the Company issued a total of 423,195 shares of
common stock to employees and consultants at per share prices ranging from $83
to $221. During fiscal 1996 and 1995, the Company purchased and retired 25,500
and 18,000 shares, respectively, under this plan. At September 30, 1996 and
1995, the number of shares of common stock outstanding includes 62,295 shares
and 154,345 shares, respectively, subject to purchase by the Company. 9. BENEFIT PLAN

Section 401k of the Internal Revenue Code. All domestic employees of the
Company who meet minimum age and service requirements are eligible to
participate in the plan. The plan allows employees to contribute 1% to 15% of
their annual salary subject to statutory limitations. The Company contributes
50% of amounts contributed by employees up to 3% of their annual salary. The
Company contribution expense was $133,000, $82,000 and $25,000 in fiscal 1996,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

Revenues from customers outside the United States were 20% 15% to Asia and 5%
to Europe, 12% 8% to Asia and 4% to Europe and 16% 7% to Asia and 9% to
Europe of total revenues for fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
During fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company had revenues from a related party
representing 21%, 21% and 24% of revenues, respectively. An executive of this
customer is a member of the Company Board of Directors. In April 1994, this
customer purchased 240,000 shares of the Company common stock from existing
stockholders. In June 1993, the Company issued a warrant to the customer to
purchase 463,974 shares of common stock for total consideration of $1,245,000.
A value of $168,000 was ascribed to this warrant when issued which has been
recorded as additional paid-in capital. The customer partially exercised this
warrant to purchase 300,000 shares for $805,000 upon closing of the Company
initial public offering of common stock. In June 1995, the customer exercised
this warrant to purchase the remaining 163,974 shares for $440,000. At
September 30, 1996, this customer is no longer a stockholder of the Company.
During fiscal 1995, the Company had revenues from one customer not a related
party representing 13% of revenues.
A financial instrument which potentially exposes the Company to concentration of
credit risk is accounts receivable, as the Company customers are concentrated
in the semiconductor industry and relatively few customers account for a
significant portion of the Company revenues. At September 30, 1996 and 1995,
accounts receivable from two customers and three customers, respectively,
accounted for approximately 36% and 49%, respectively, of accounts receivable.
The Company regularly monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and
believes that it has adequately provided for any exposure to potential credit
losses. 11. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
During fiscal 1996, 1995 and 1994, the Company acquired $630,000, $348,000 and
$155,000, respectively, of fixed assets under capital leases.
During fiscal 1996, the Company recorded compensation expense of $69,000 in
connection with the purchase and retirement of 25,500 shares of restricted
common stock Note 8. During fiscal 1995, the Company recorded deferred
compensation of $264,000 relating to certain common stock issued and common
stock options granted during the twelve month period prior to the initial filing

CONTINGENCY
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual
property rights in the semiconductor and related industries. The Company has
received notice from a third-party alleging infringements of such party patent
rights by certain of the Company products. The Company patent counsel is
investigating the claim and the Company believes the patents claimed may be
invalid. In the event of litigation with respect to this claim, the Company is
prepared to vigorously defend its position. However, because patent litigation
can be extremely expensive and time consuming, the Company may seek to obtain a
license to one or more of the disputed patents. Based upon currently available
information, the Company would only do so if such license fees would not be
material to the Company consolidated financial statements. Currently, the
Company does not believe that it is probable that future events related to this
threatened matter will have an adverse effect on the Company business. The
Company is currently unable to reasonably estimate any possible loss related to
this matter.
