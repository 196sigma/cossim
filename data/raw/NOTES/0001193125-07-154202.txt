FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  Financial Statements  VeriSigns financial statements required by this item are set forth as a separate section of this Form 10-K. See  a1 for a listing of
financial statements provided in the section titled Financial Statements.  Supplemental Data Unaudited  The following
tables set forth unaudited supplementary quarterly financial data for the two year period ended December31, 2006. In managements opinion, the unaudited data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited information and includes all
adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the data for the periods presented.  The following tables for selected quarterly unaudited supplementary quarterly financial information have been restated for all quarters of fiscal 2005 and
the first quarter of fiscal 2006 from previously reported information filed on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. All previously reported quarters of fiscal 2005 have been adjusted to show the discontinued operations from the sale of our payments gateway
service in November 2005. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied upon.  2006 FirstQuarter2 As Restated SecondQuarter3 ThirdQuarter FourthQuarter YearEndedDecember31 In thousands, except per share data Continuing operations Revenues 372,818 390,690 399,513 412,228 1,575,249 Costs and expenses 360,948 359,435 374,019 385,027 1,479,429 Operating income 11,870 31,255 25,494 27,201 95,820 Net income loss 15,677 376,696 15,107 29,510 377,970 Net income loss per share: 1 Basic 006 154 006 012 155 Diluted 006 152 006 012 153 Discontinued operations Revenues 49 80 120 89 Costs and expenses 858 11 287 22 1,134 Operating income 809 91 167 22 1,045 Net income loss 809 91 167 22 1,045 Net income per share: 1 Basic 001 Diluted 001 Total Net income loss 16,486 376,787 15,274 29,532 379,015 Net income loss per share: 1 Basic 007 154 006 012 155 Diluted 007 152 006 012 153

Net income loss per share is computed independently for each of the quarters represented in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No128,
Earnings per Share. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly net income loss per share may not equal the total computed for the fiscal year or any cumulative interim period. 2
Net income for the first quarter ended March31, 2006 includes a $217 million gain on from sale of our remaining equity stake in Network Solutions that was previously written
off. 3
Net income for the second quarter ended June30, 2006, includes the release of our valuation allowance of $2364 million from our deferred tax assets resulting in a
non-recurring benefit to tax expense and a $1133 million tax benefit that was the result of a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service relating to an uncertain tax position on a capital loss generated in 2003. 4
Net income for 2005 includes gain on sale of discontinued operations of $2506 million, and other charges of approximately $216 million related to the abandonment of the
development efforts related to an internally developed software project.  Our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and should not be relied
upon as an indication of future performance. Also, operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of securities analysts or investors in one or more future quarters. If this were to occur, the market price of our common stock
would likely decline. For more information regarding the quarterly fluctuation of our revenues and operating results, see Item1A Risk FactorsOur operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are
uncertain.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  As discussed in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this report, the Ad Hoc Group of independent directors of the Board of Directors conducted a
review of our historical stock option granting practices for the period January 1998 through May 2006. During the course of the review, the Ad Hoc Group identified stock option grantswith incorrect measurement dates, without required
documentation, or with initial grant dates and exercise prices that were subsequently modified. Consequently, we have recorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants. In
this Form10-K, we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of December31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years
ended December31, 2005 and 2004.  Details of the
restatement and its underlying circumstances are discussed in the Explanatory Note at the beginning of this report and in Note2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in  of this report.  a. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules13a-15eand 15d-15eunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act as of
December31, 2006. We determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed below. Notwithstanding the material weakness discussed below, our management,
based upon the substantial work performed during the preparation of this report and the related restatement of historical financial information, has concluded that our consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included in this
report are prepared in accordance generally accepted accounting principals in the U.S. and fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for each of the periods presented herein.
b. Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 using the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission COSO.  A material weakness is a
control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Based on our evaluation under the
COSO framework, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 arising from a combination of the following control deficiencies in our stock administration policies and
practices:  Failure to consistently implement and apply policies and procedures related to the approval of equity-based grants to executive officers, retention grants and
grants made in connection with new hires, promotions, and annual performance reviews.  
105 Table of Contents Lack of complete and timely reconciliation of grants and cancellations from our stock administration database to our financial reporting systems; lack of consistent
reconciliation of grant dates in the system of record to supporting documentation.  Inadequate supervision and training of personnel involved with the equity-based grant processes.  Lack of effective coordination and communication among the Human Resources Department, Accounting Department and Legal Department in connection with the
administration of equity-based grants.  Accordingly, we concluded that the control deficiencies resulted in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected.  A material weakness comprised of similar control deficiencies to those noted
above resulted in material errors to, and the restatement of, the 2005 and 2004 annual consolidated financial statements and the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods in 2005 and for the interim period ended
March31, 2006.  As a result of the material weakness
described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2006 based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
COSO.  The Company acquired m-Qube, Inc. m-Qube
and inCode Telecom Group, Inc. inCode on May 1, 2006 and November 30, 2006, respectively. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 m-Qubes
and inCodes internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $316,131,000 and $89,656,000, respectively, and total revenues of $26,985,000 and $5,000,000, respectively, included in the consolidated financial statements
of VeriSign, Inc. and subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006.  KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on managements assessment of internal control over financial reporting.  c. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Subsequent to December31, 2006, our Board of Directors approved
additional internal control policies and procedures intended to remediate the material weakness described above. As of the date of this filing, we have implemented or are in the process of implementing the following corrective actions:  Develop and implement detailed equity-based grant policies and procedures and related compensation and human resources practices, including procedures to ensure
accurate and timely communication of Compensation Committee actions.  Validation of critical stock administration data fields including employee termination dates and stock option cancellation dates.  Designation of individuals in the legal and accounting departments to oversee the documentation of, and accounting for, equity-based grants.
Additional training for our finance, human resource, stock administration, and legal personnel concerning the equity grant process and the accounting and financial
reporting for equity awards and modifications of such awards.  Awarding equity-based grants new hire, promotion, and annual performance at pre-determined dates, with all required approvals documented and finalized on or
before those dates.  Improving the coordination and communication among the human resources, accounting and legal departments to identify, in advance, accounting issues relating to
equity-based awards, and to ensure that those awards are properly accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles.

Additionally, we are
investing in ongoing efforts to continuously improve the Companys internal control over financial reporting and have committed considerable resources to the improvement of the design, implementation, documentation, testing and monitoring of
our internal controls.  As of the date of this filing, we
believe that we have made substantial progress in the implementation of the corrective actions noted above and toward remediation of the material weakness.  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15f and 15d-15f under the Exchange Act
during the three months ended December31, 2006 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.  Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent material errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The continued effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks, including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.
