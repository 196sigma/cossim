SOURCECORP, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
1. Organization and Basis of Presentation: 
SOURCECORP, Incorporated the Company was founded in September1994, to create a national, single source provider of document and information
outsourcing solutions to document and information intensive industries, including: financial services, government, legal, healthcare and transportation. The Company acquired seven document management
services businesses the Founding Companies simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering the IPO on January26, 1996, and effectively began operations at that time. The
consideration for the Founding Companies consisted of a combination of cash and common stock the Common Stock of the Company. 
Since
the IPO, the Company has acquired nine companies in transactions that were accounted for as poolings-of-interests: iThe Rust Consulting
Group,Inc. Rust in December1996; iiMAVRICC Management Systems,Inc. and a related company, MMS Escrow and Transfer Agency,Inc. collectively, MAVRICC in
March1997; iiiInput of Texas,Inc. Input in March1997; ivMicro Publishing Systems,Inc. MPS in December1997; vLifo
Systems,Inc. Lifo in February1998; viCreative Mailings,Inc. CMI in September1998; viiEconomic Research Services ERS in
October1998; viiiTCH Mailhouse,Inc. and GW Enterprise,Inc. collectively, TCH; in December1998; and ixAdvanced Digital Graphics,Inc.
ADG in December1998 collectively, the Pooled Companies. The Pooled Companies and the Company were not under common control or management during the periods prior to their respective
mergers. 
Subsequent
to the IPO and through December31, 2001, the Company has acquired 55 additional companies in transactions accounted for as purchases and has divested of 17 operating
units by sales or closure. The results of operations include the results of these acquisitions from the date of their respective acquisitions. Effective
February14, 2002, the Company changed its name from F.Y.I. Incorporated to SOURCECORP, Incorporated. 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost,
which approximates market value. 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease. 
Intangible Assets 
Intangibles consist primarily of goodwill. Based on the historical profitability of the purchased companies and trends in the legal, healthcare and other
industries regarding the outsourcing of document management functions in the foreseeable future, goodwill has been amortized over periods not to exceed 30years. Management continually
evaluates whether events and circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of intangible assets might warrant revisions or that the remaining balance of intangibles or other
long-lived assets may not be recoverable. To make this evaluation, management compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the intangibles or other 
31  long-lived assets to the carrying amount of the assets being evaluated. If the expected future cash flows do not exceed the carrying amount of the assets being evaluated, an impairment
loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the impaired assets over their fair value. No impairments were recorded in 1999 and 2000. See Note3 regarding the divestitures
and closures of certain non-strategic operating units for 2001 impairments. 
Revenue Recognition 
Revenue is recognized when the services are rendered, or products are delivered to the customer. Unearned revenue represents certain services which are billed in
advance of performing the services. 
Income Taxes 
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No109, Accounting
for Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable in future years to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. 
Net Income Loss Per Share 
Basic net income loss per share has been computed by dividing income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted
net income loss per share has been computed by dividing income loss by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period. 
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Consolidation 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SOURCECORP, Incorporated and our
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, net, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the
short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value due to interest rates that approximate current market rates for instruments of similar
size and duration. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In June2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS No142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No141 requires the use of the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after June30, 2001, thereby eliminating the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting. SFAS No141 also addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business
combination. 
32  The adoption of SFAS No141 by the Company on July1, 2001, did not have a significant effect on the Company financial statements. 
The
Company will adopt the provisions of SFAS No142 on January1, 2002. Upon the adoption of SFAS No142, goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite
useful lives will not be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill amortization was approximately $100million for 2001, $52million of which was
deductible for tax purposes. The Company will complete its assessment of goodwill impairment by June30, 2002. While the assessment has not been completed, the Company does not anticipate a
material impairment of goodwill as of January1, 2002, as a result of adopting the provisions of SFAS142. 
In
August2001, the FASB issued SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. This statement supercedes SFAS No121,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. The statement retains the previously existing accounting requirements related
to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long-lived assets to be disposed
of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held for sale. The Company will implement SFAS No144 on January1, 2002, and does not expect this statement to have a significant effect on the
Company financial statements. 
3. Special Charges 
During the second and third quarters of 2001, the Company completed its strategic realignment plan. As part of this plan, the Company identified certain
non-strategic operating units for divestiture or closure, and accordingly, developed and committed to a divestiture plan. The non-strategic operating units were evaluated based
on criteria such as market growth potential, current operating performance, revenue and earning growth potential, and expected sources and uses of capital. In June2001, the Company completed
the sale of five automated litigation support companies, two legal copy companies, two records acquisition companies and its commercial systems integration consulting services company. During the
third quarter, the Company completed the sale of three print-on-demand companies, the sale of its investors' services company, and the closure of a systems integration company.
As a result of the divestiture plan and the completed divestitures and closures, the Company recorded $626million of pre-tax special charges. Additionally, in the second quarter,
the Company recorded a $05million charge to write-off deferred debt costs due to the refinancing of long-term obligations, which is included in interest expense. The
following details the components of such charges in millions: Net loss on sale of assets 554 Costs to exit non-strategic activities/locations 57 One-time legal charge 15 Total special charges 626 Write-down of deferred financing cost 05 Total pre-tax charges 631 33

terminated the previous line of credit agreement. Under the 2001 Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow on a revolving credit basis loans in an aggregate outstanding principal amount up to
$2975million, subject to certain customary borrowing capacity requirements. The 2001 Credit Agreement is secured by the stock of the Company material subsidiaries, and in the event the
Company exceeds a designated leverage ratio, by the assets of the Company and subsidiaries. The availability under the 2001 Credit Agreement as of December31, 2001, was $1158million. The
commitment to fund revolving credit loans under the 2001 Credit Agreement expires April3, 2004. The annual interest rate applicable to borrowings under this facility is, at
the Company option, igrid pricing ranging from 00% to 05% plus the prime rate based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA as defined in the credit agreement or iigrid pricing
ranging from 1125% to 20% plus LIBOR based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA. The 2001 Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances, such as asset dispositions. The
outstanding principal balance of revolving credit loans is due and payable on April3, 2004. 
The
Company has outstanding an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of approximately $21million to serve as guarantee for periodic principal and interest payments related
to the Industrial Revenue Bonds. In January1998, the Company entered into a letter of credit in the amount of $100million to serve as a guarantee for performance under a contract with
New York State Workers Compensation Board. In April1999, the amount of the letter of credit was reduced to $50million. Additionally, in November2000, the Company entered into
a letter of credit in the amount of $16million to serve as security for the Company workmen compensation program. 
The
weighted average interest rate on long-term obligations at December31, 2000 and 2001 was 76% and 68%, respectively. The 2001 Credit Agreement contains certain
reporting requirements and financial covenants, including requirements that we maintain minimum levels of net worth, a maximum ratio of 
38  funded debt to EBITDA and other financial ratios. As of December31, 2001, we are in compliance with all loan covenants. 
In
December2000, in order to mitigate interest rate risk, the Company entered into an interest rate hedge agreement in the amount of $500million, whereby the Company has
fixed the interest rate through March2003 on the amount of the hedge agreement at 5775% plus the applicable floating spread. See Note12 regarding the interest rate hedge.

11. Stockholders' Equity: 
Stock Options and Warrants: 
At December31, 2001, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan, the 1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended the Plan, which is described below. The
Company has issued warrants the Warrants to certain key employees and employees of our subsidiaries. The Company refers to these options and warrants collectively as Awards. The Company applies
APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for awards. Awards are granted at the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for the awards. Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value at grant dates for these awards consistent with the method of SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock
Based Compensation, our net income and earnings per share would have been as follows in thousands, except for per share data: December 31 1999
2000
2001 Net income loss under SFAS 123 20,914 28,970 22,219 Diluted net income loss per common share under SFAS 123 140 180 133 Actual net income loss 24,001 32,101 18,149 Actual diluted net income loss per common share 160 200 108 The
fair value of the Awards was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for 1999: risk free interest rate ranging
from 45% to
61%, no dividend yield, average expected life of three years, and volatility of 35%. The following assumptions were used for 2000: risk free interest rate ranging from 50% to 68%, no dividend
yield, average expected life of three years, and volatility of 40%. The following assumptions were used for 2001: risk free interest rate ranging from 36% to 50%, no dividend yield, average expected
life of three years, and volatility of 40%. The weighted average Black-Scholes value of Awards granted during 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $758, $1117, and $1240, respectively. The
Plan provides awards of options to purchase common stock and may include incentive stock options ISOs and/or non-qualified stock options. The Plan also provides for
automatic option grants to directors who are not otherwise employed by us or our subsidiaries. Upon commencement of service or upon agreeing to serve in the case of the initial
non-employee directors, a non-employee director will receive a non-qualified option to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock, and continuing
non-employee directors will receive annual options to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock. Options granted to non-employee directors become exercisable one-third
on the date of grant and one-third on each of the next two anniversaries of the date of grant. Non-employee directors' options have a term of five years from the date of grant. The
maximum number of shares of common stock that may be subject to outstanding options under the Plan, determined immediately after the grant of any option, is the greater of 650,000
shares or 16% of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock outstanding; provided, however, that options to purchase no more than 650,000 shares of common stock may be granted as ISOs. At
December31, 2000 and 2001, approximately 1,046,000 and 1,099,000 shares, respectively, were available for issuance. 
41  The
Company had 2,939,859 Awards outstanding at December31, 2001. These Awards, other than those granted to employee directors, have 10-year expirations. Awards Outstanding Shares

average common shares and diluted weighted average common shares and common stock equivalents are as follows in thousands: Year Ended December 31 1999

At
December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, approximately 0, 88,000 and 654,000, respectively, of common stock equivalents were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation
because they were anti-dilutive.These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in future earnings per share calculations. 12. Derivatives 
Effective January1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This statement requires that all derivative financial instruments be recognized as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and carried at fair value. Gains or losses on
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are initially reported
as a component of other comprehensive income and later classified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item also affects earnings. 
The
Company has entered into an interest rate swap for $500million to hedge, through March31, 2003, its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on $50million
of its debt. The swap has been designated by the Company as a cash flow hedge. As of December31, 2001, the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately
$20million $12million, net of tax, which was recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other long-term obligations with an offset recorded in equity as
accumulated other comprehensive loss. This swap has the effect of fixing the interest rate on $50million of the Company debt at 5775% plus the applicable floating spread. 
13. Employee Benefit Plans: 
The Company established a defined contribution plan the 401k plan in January1997. The 401k plan covers our employees and the employees of some of
our subsidiaries. The employees must be at least 21years of age and are eligible for the plan on the first day of the quarter following 90days of service. In addition, the Company
established a non-qualified plan in December1996. The non-qualified compensation plan permits eligible officers and certain highly compensated employees to defer a
portion of their compensation. Contributions to both the 401k plan and the non-qualified compensation plan consist of employee pre-tax contributions determined as a
percentage of each participating employee compensation. The Company may make contributions to either or both plans at the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Company has not made any
contributions to the 401k plan or the non-qualified compensation plan. The Company offers no post-employment or post-retirement benefits. Certain
of the operating companies have separate qualified defined contribution employee benefit plans the Plans, the majority of which allow for voluntary pre-tax
contributions by employees. The subsidiaries pay all general and administrative expenses of the Plans and, in some cases, the subsidiaries make matching and discretionary contributions to the Plans.
The subsidiaries offer no post-employment or post-retirement benefits. The expense incurred related to the Plans was approximately $887,000, $970,000, and $924,000 for the
years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively. 
14. Related Party Transactions:  Leasing Transactions 
Certain operating companies lease their operating facilities, along with certain equipment, from selling parties who remained as employees. These leases are for
various lengths and annual amounts. The rental expense for these operating leases for the years ended December31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 was approximately $1,362,000, $1,113,000 and $1,356,000,
respectively. 
Notes Receivable 
In the acquisition of the Founding Companies, the Company acquired $642,000 of notes receivable from two Founding Company shareholders. When the Company began
operations, the shareholders 
43  entered into new notes receivable with a stated interest rate 5% and principal payment schedules. Principal and interest were paid in full by the shareholders in 2000. 
15. Commitments and Contingencies:  Litigation 
The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business. Management believes that none of these actions will have a
material adverse effect on the Company business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents and certain other financial instruments at various major financial institutions across many geographic areas. Credit risk on trade receivables is
minimized as a result of the large number of entities comprising our client base and their dispersion across many industries and geographic areas. 
16. Segment Reporting: 
The Company is principally engaged in business process outsourcing services. The identified segments based on management responsibility are as follows: 
Information
Management and Distribution. This segment includes companies that provide the following services: electronic imaging; analog services; data capture and database management;
