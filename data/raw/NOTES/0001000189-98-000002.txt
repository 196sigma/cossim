ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA.             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Ocal, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ocal, Inc. as 
of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the related consolidated statements of 
income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 1997. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Ocal, Inc. as of 
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the consolidated results of its operations and 
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 
1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                      ERNST & YOUNG LLP

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.                  OCAL, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A Basis of Presentation: Concurrent with the closing of the Company 
initial public offering of common stock on March 18, 1996 Note 4, all of the 
outstanding capital stock of OCAL, Incorporated Ocal Alabama, Occidental 
Coating Company Occidental, Ocal Data Company Ocal Data, and Ocal 
Transport Co. Ocal Transport was acquired by the Company through capital 
contributions by their respective prior stockholders in exchange for an 
aggregate of 3,250,000 shares of the Company common stock the 
Reorganization. The Company Chairman, CEO and President was the sole or 
majority stockholder of each of the contributed companies and is the 538% 
stockholder of the Company as of December 31, 1997. 
The accounts of Ocal Alabama, Occidental, Ocal Data and Ocal Transport are 
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company 
on their historical basis. The stockholders' equity section of the consolidated 
financial statements for prior periods has been retroactively restated from 
that reported in the Registration Statement and Prospectus related to the 
Company initial public offering to reflect the Company capital structure 
and the Reorganization with the common stock of these entities classified as 
paid-in capital. 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
in consolidation. 
B Description of Business: The Company manufactures PVC-coated rigid 
steel conduit, elbows and fittings which are sold principally in the United 
States to distributors who resell the products for ultimate use principally in 
new construction or as replacement parts. 
C Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements: The 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and 
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
D Cash and Cash Equivalents: At December 31, 1997, cash equivalents 
include highly liquid investments of approximately $4,200,000 invested 
primarily in tax-exempt municipal securities and high-grade commercial paper. 
These investments are stated at cost which approximates fair value. The Company 
considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of 
three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
E Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost first-in, 
first-out method or market and consist of the following amounts in 
thousands:                     December 31,
1997    1996
Raw materials       $ 3,344   $ 3,038
Finished goods       4,416    3,909
$ 7,760   $ 6,947
F Property and Equipment: Property and equipment are recorded at cost and 
are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated 
useful lives: 
Galvanizer                         20 years
Other manufacturing equipment and molds           7 years
Office equipment                      5-7 years
Vehicles                           3 years
Leasehold improvements            Remaining life of lease
G Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales 
to customers upon shipment. The Company warrants its products against defects 
for six years and has policies permitting customers to return products under 
certain circumstances. In addition, certain of the Company distributors and 
agents are entitled to rebates upon attaining specified sales levels. A 
provision has been made for the estimated amount of product returns and rebates 
that may occur under these programs. 
H Income Taxes: The Company accounts for income taxes under Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes SFAS 
109. SFAS 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences 
of events that have been recognized in the Company financial statements or 
tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS 109 generally 
considers all expected future events other than enactments of changes in the 
tax law or rates. 
Prior to the Reorganization, Ocal Alabama had elected to be taxed as an S 
corporation under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Under those 
provisions, Ocal Alabama did not pay federal or state corporate income taxes on 
its taxable income. Instead, the stockholders were liable for federal and state 
income taxes on Ocal Alabama taxable income. The State of California adopted 
the provisions of the S corporation election but charged a franchise tax at the 
corporate level. In connection with the Company initial public offering, Ocal 
Alabama Subchapter S election was terminated, and accordingly, the Company 
then became subject to federal and state income taxes. For information 
purposes, the pro forma financial information see Note 3 includes pro forma 
amounts for the income taxes that would have been recorded as if all of the 
Company income during the pro forma periods presented were taxed at C 
corporation rates. 
I Fair Value of Financial Instruments: The carrying values of the 
Company financial instruments, which consist of cash and cash equivalents and 
notes payable - stockholders, approximate their fair values. 
J Reclassifications: Certain previously reported amounts have been 
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
K New Accounting Standard: In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board issued Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share, which replaced the 
calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share with basic and 
diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share, basic earnings 
per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and convertible 
securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the previously 
reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share amounts 
presented have been recalculated to comply with Statement 128 requirements, 
which did not change amounts previously reported. The effect of adopting 
Statement 128 was not material. 
2. EARNINGS PER SHARE 
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings 
per share amounts in thousands, except per share data:  
1997     1996     1995
Numerator: Net income for basic
and diluted earnings per share      $ 1,508   $ 2,356   $ 1,081
Denominator:
Weighted average shares           5,762    5,224    3,250
Effect of dilutive securities:
Warrants                    --      --       Stock options                 --      --      -- 
Dilutive potential common shares         --      --      Denominator for basic and
diluted earnings per share         5,762    5,224    3,250
Basic and diluted earnings per share    $ 026   $ 045   $ 033
For additional disclosures regarding the stock options and warrants, see
Note 8. All options and warrants were excluded from the computation of diluted 
earnings per share because the exercise prices for both the options and 
warrants were greater than the average market price of the common shares during 
the relevant periods, and therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. 
3. PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION UNAUDITED 
The pro forma financial information is prepared on a basis consistent with 
pro forma information disclosed in the Registration Statement and Prospectus 
related to the Company initial public offering. The pro forma financial 
information includes adjustments i to reduce stockholders' compensation 
expense, relating to salaries and bonuses paid to certain stockholders, by 
$2,493,000 for the year ended December 31, 1995, and ii to provide for 
related income taxes as if all of the Company income during the pro forma 
periods presented were taxed at C corporation rates based upon pro forma income 
before income taxes. Reconciliations between historical and pro forma results 
of operations follow in thousands except per share amounts:  
For the Years Ended December 31,
1996     1995
Income before income taxes                $ 3,536   $ 1,103
Pro forma adjustments described above

Pro forma net income                   $ 2,116   $ 2,158
Pro forma basic and diluted earnings per share      $ 041   $ 066
Weighted average shares outstanding            5,224    3,250
4. INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING 
On March 18, 1996, the Company completed the initial public offering of 
2,200,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $500 per share. On April 
25, 1996, the underwriters exercised their overallotment option by purchasing 
an additional 330,000 shares of the Company common stock at a price of $500 
per share. After underwriters' discounts, commissions and expenses, the net 
proceeds of the offering and overallotment exercise to the Company were 
$10,000,000.

6. REVOLVING BANK LINE OF CREDIT 
The Company has a revolving bank line of credit with SouthTrust Bank, 
National Association that expires July 31, 2000 and provides for maximum 
borrowings of $6,500,000 subject to certain specified percentages of the 
Company accounts receivable and inventories. The related credit agreement 
requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and tangible net worth 
amounts and provides for various restrictions, including limitations on capital 
expenditures, additional indebtedness, salaries of certain officers of the 
Company, and payment of dividends by the Company. Interest on borrowings 
outstanding under the bank line is based, at the Company option, on the 
London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR or the bank prime rate 85% at 
December 31, 1997. At December 31, 1997, the annual interest rate based on the 
LIBOR pricing option was LIBOR plus 20%, and the annual interest rate based on 
the prime rate was prime. At December 31, 1997, there were no borrowings 
outstanding under the bank line of credit, and the amount of unused credit 
available, based upon the Company collateral, was $4,861,000.

As part of the Reorganization on March 18, 1996, Ocal Alabama declared a 
distribution to its then stockholders in an amount of $4,600,000, which was an 
estimate of all of its undistributed S corporation retained earnings as of that 
date. The distribution by the Company on Ocal Alabama behalf was paid as 
follows: 
i $1,600,000 was paid in cash on March 25, 1996; and 
ii $3,000,000 in notes payable were issued to the stockholders of Ocal 
Alabama, bearing interest at the rate of 65% per annum. On September 
18, 1997, $1,500,000 principal amount of the notes were repaid in cash, 
and the remaining $1,500,000 principal amount of the notes are payable 
on March 18, 1999. 
The amount of undistributed S corporation retained earnings as of March 18, 
1996 was finalized as $4,900,000 after Ocal Alabama income tax return for the 
period from January 1, 1996 through March 18, 1996 was completed. The 
additional $300,000 of undistributed S corporation retained earnings, 
classified as a distribution payable to stockholders, was paid in cash to 
former stockholders in February 1997 and reflected in current liabilities at 
December 31, 1996. 
Other 
The Company corporate office is leased at an annual rent of $36,000 from 
a partnership in which the Company majority stockholder is the general 
partner, and the lease expires on December 31, 1998. 
Summary 
Amounts of these related party transactions charged to expense are as follows 
amounts in thousands:                        Years Ended December 31,
1997     1996    1995
Rent expense               $  36   $  36   $  66
Interest expense             $  184   $  170   $  88 8. CAPITAL STOCK 
Preferred Stock 
The Company Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 
shares of preferred stock, in series, to fix dividend rates, conversion rights, 
voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preferences, and to increase or 
decrease the number of shares in any series. No preferred stock is currently 
outstanding, and the Company has no present plans to issue any preferred stock.
Specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to 
restrict the Company ability to merge with, or sell its assets to, a third 
party. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock could 
discourage, delay or prevent a takeover of the Company, thereby preserving 
control of the Company by the current stockholders. 
Stock Options 
In August 1995, the Board of Directors adopted, and the stockholders of the 
Company approved, the Ocal, Inc. 1995 Stock Option Plan the Plan. The Plan 
provides for the award of incentive stock options to employees and the award of 
non-qualified stock options to employees, independent contractors, directors 
and consultants. The Company reserved 400,000 shares of Common Stock under the 
Plan. Options to purchase Common Stock are generally conditioned upon continued 
employment or service to the Company, expire from five to ten years after the 
grant date, and become exercisable commencing with the first anniversary date 
of the grant. Stock options under the Plan are granted at prices not less than 
the fair market value on the date of the grant. 
There were no options outstanding prior to the Company initial public 
offering on March 18, 1996. The following is a summary of stock option activity 
under the Plan:                        1997          1996

remaining contractual life of 889 years and the exercise prices range from 
$319 to $594 per share. 
On February 17, 1998, the Stock Option Committee of the Company Board of 
Directors passed a resolution to cancel all of the outstanding options under 
the Plan and replace them with new option grants, effective February 18, 1998. 
The new options expire ten years after the grant date, maintain the original 
vesting schedule of the options they replace, and have an exercise price of 
$2375 per share. 
Pro Forma Fair Value Disclosures 
The Company accounts for its stock options using the intrinsic value method 
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 APB 25, Accounting 
for Stock Issued to Employees, and related Interpretations. Accordingly, no 
compensation expense related to these plans has been recognized in the 
Company financial statements. The table below sets out the pro forma amounts 
of net income and net income per share that would have resulted if the Company 
accounted for its stock options under the fair value recognition provisions of 
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation and excludes the 
effects of the above-mentioned cancellation and replacement of options in 
thousands except per share amounts:                               1997    1996
Net income as reported                   $ 1,508   $ 2,356
Net income - pro forma                    1,435    2,310
Primary and diluted earnings per share - as reported     026    045
Primary and diluted earnings per share - pro forma     $ 025   $ 044  For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the 
options is amortized over the options' vesting periods. The fair value of each 
option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model with the following assumptions:                          1997        1996
Expected dividend yield              000%        000%
Expected stock price volatility          430%        464%
Risk-free interest rate              570%        670%
Expected life of options             5 years       5 years
Vesting assumption            333% per year   333% per year  The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating 
the fair value of traded options. The Company stock options have 
characteristics significantly different from those of traded options such as 
vesting restrictions and extremely limited transferability. In addition, the 
assumptions used in option valuation models are highly subjective, particularly 
the expected stock price volatility of the underlying stock. Because changes in 
these subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value 
estimate, in management opinion, the existing models do not provide a 
reliable single measure of the fair value of its stock options. 
Pro forma net income and earnings per share are the same as reported amounts 
prior to 1996, as no stock options were granted until the initial public 
offering on March 18, 1996. Because options generally vest over three years and 
new option grants are generally made each year, the pro forma amounts shown 
above may not be representative of the pro forma effect on reported net income 
in future years. 
Warrants 
At December 31, 1997, warrants to purchase up to 220,000 shares of Common 
Stock were outstanding. These warrants were issued to underwriters in 
connection with the Company initial public offering, and are exercisable for 
a period of four years commencing March 18, 1997 at an exercise price of $650 
per share. 
9. INCOME TAXES 
Through March 18, 1996, the date of the Reorganization and the Company 
initial public offering, Ocal Alabama and Ocal Data had elected to be taxed as 
S corporations under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Pursuant to 
such elections, stockholders of these companies included their proportionate 
share of the taxable income of these companies in their personal tax returns. 
Accordingly, no provision for federal income taxes was required or provided for 
the operations of Ocal Alabama and Ocal Data through March 18, 1996. The State 
of California adopted the provisions of the S corporation election but charged 
a franchise tax at the corporate level. As of March 18, 1996, as a result of 
the Reorganization, the Company and all of its subsidiaries became C 
corporations subject to state and federal income taxes at statutory rates. Such 
income taxes are provided on the results of operations in the accompanying 
consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 1997 and the 
period from March 18, 1996 through December 31, 1996. 
The components of the provision for income taxes are as follows amounts in 
thousands:                  Years ended December 31,

between the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities in the Company 
financial statements and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant 
components of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:                          December 31,

10. STOCKHOLDERS' COMPENSATION 
Stockholders' compensation in 1995 includes amounts distributed to former 
stockholders of Ocal Alabama to facilitate the payment of their personal income 
taxes which include the taxable income of Ocal Alabama for those years as a 
result of its election of S corporation status. 
11. LEASE COMMITMENTS 
The Company leases its manufacturing facilities under an agreement expiring 
on December 31, 2001. The lease for the manufacturing facilities contains 
certain rent escalation clauses based upon changes in the Consumer Price Index 
and provides the Company with an option to extend the lease through December 
31, 2002. The Company majority stockholder has personally guaranteed the 
lease obligation for the manufacturing facilities. The Company corporate 
office is leased from a partnership in which the Company majority stockholder 
is the general partner see Note 7, and the expiration date of that lease is 
December 31, 1998. The Company also leases autos under various agreements 
expiring in 2000. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating 
leases as of December 31, 1997 are as follows amounts in thousands:    Years ended December 31,
1998              $  235
1999                178
2000                168

Thereafter                                             Total             $  729
Rent expense was as follows amounts in thousands:    Years ended December 31,
1997              $  199
1996                196
1995                167  Included in rent expense are amounts paid to a partnership for rental of the 
Company corporate office in the amounts indicated in Note 7. 
12. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations 
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. The 
Company places its cash equivalents with high credit quality institutions. 
The primary users of the Company products are electrical contractors and 
large industrial companies that obtain such products through a group of 
approximately 700 distributors and resellers who purchase the products directly 
from the Company. Credit is extended to these distributors and resellers based 
upon an evaluation of the customer financial condition, and collateral is 
generally not required. Management does not believe significant credit risk 
exists at December 31, 1997. 
The Company four largest customers are multiple location distributors. 
These customers are comprised of chains of individual distributors who make 
independent purchasing decisions. In 1997, sales to one customer represented 
102% of the Company net sales. During 1996, sales to any individual customer 
did not exceed 10% of the Company net sales. During 1995, there were two 
individual customers that represented 153% and 114%, respectively, of the 
Company net sales. Management believes that the loss of any of these 
distributors would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
The Company is a party to various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of 
business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any of these 
lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Company business or 
financial condition.

related to the Company initial public offering. The pro forma financial 
information includes an adjustment to provide related income taxes as if all of 
the Company income prior to the IPO had been taxed at C corporation rates 
based upon income before income taxes. The above earnings per share amounts 
have been recalculated to comply with Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 128, Earnings per Share, which did not change amounts 
previously reported.
