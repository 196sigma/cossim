RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This management discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations includes a number of forward looking statements which
reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial
performance. These forward looking statements are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties, including those discussed below and those under the
caption Business Risks in Item 1, that could cause actual results to differ
materially from historical results or those anticipated.
OVERVIEW
Optika is a leading provider of business-to-business electronic commerce
solutions. By leveraging the technology of the Internet, our software
bridges the gap between paper and electronic commerce across the enterprise
and throughout supply chains.
The license of our software products is typically an executive-level
decision by prospective end-users and generally requires us and our APs or
OEMs to engage in a lengthy and complex sales cycle typically between six
and twelve months from the initial contact date. We distribute our products
through a direct sales force and a network of APs and OEMs. For 1999,
approximately 71% of our license revenues were derived from our APs,
approximately 3% of our license revenues were derived from sales by OEMs and
the remaining license fees were derived from direct sales. However, no
individual AP accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. For the
years ended December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999, we generated approximately 23 24% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenues from international sales.
Our revenues consist primarily of license revenues, which are comprised of
one-time fees for the license of our products; service revenues; and
maintenance revenues, which are comprised of fees for upgrades and technical
support. Our APs and OEMs, which are responsible for the installation and
integration of the software for their customers, enter into sales agreements
with the end-user, and purchase software directly from us. We license
software directly to the end-user through software license agreements. Annual
maintenance agreements are also entered into between the APs and OEMs and the
end-user, and the APs and OEMs then purchase maintenance services directly
from us. For 1998 and 1999, approximately 60% and 53%, respectively of our
total revenues were derived from software licenses and approximately 28% and
33%, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from maintenance
agreements. For 1998 and 1999, other revenues, which are comprised of
training, consulting and implementation services, and third-party hardware
and software products, accounted for 12% and 14%, respectively, of our total
revenues.
We adopted the provisions of Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition SOP 97-2, for transactions entered into after January 1, 1998.
Under SOP 97-2, we will generally recognize license revenue upon shipment
when a non-cancelable license agreement has been signed or a purchase order
has been received, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable
and collectibility is probable. Where applicable, fees from multiple element
arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are
delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value
exists for the delivered and undelivered elements. Maintenance revenues are
deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period, which is
generally one year. Other revenues are recognized as services are performed.
We generally do not grant rights to return products, except for defects
in the performance of the products relative to specifications and pursuant to
standard industry shrink-wrapped license agreements which provide for 30-day
rights of return if an end-user does not accept the terms of the
shrink-wrapped license agreements. Our software license agreements generally
do not provide price adjustments or rotation rights. We generally include a
90-day limited warranty with the software license, which entitles the
end-user to corrections for documented program errors.
Based on our research and development process, costs incurred between the
establishment of technological feasibility and general release of the
software products are immaterial and therefore have not been capitalized in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86. All
research and development costs have been expensed as incurred.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO DECEMBER 31, 1998
Revenues
Total revenues increased 17% from $185 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 to $218 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Licenses. License revenues increased 3% from $111 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 to $115 million for the year ended December 31,
1999, representing approximately 60% and 53%, respectively of total revenues
in both periods. Although the year over year increase is minimal, the change
in composition of license revenue is significant. For the year ended December
31, 1998 licenses of our Optika eMedia software generated 18% of our license
revenue. For the year ended December 31, 1999 licenses of our Optika eMedia
software generated 72% of our total license revenue. Management believes that
the increase is primarily a result of continued customer acceptance of Optika
eMedia, which became commercially available in late September 1998. Licenses
of our Filepower software product to new customers will cease effective March
2000. License revenues generated outside of the United States decreased from
approximately 32% of license revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
approximately 19% of license revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999.
This decrease is attributable to the closure of several Asian offices in
1998.
Maintenance and Other. Maintenance revenues, exclusive of other
revenues, increased 36%, from approximately $52 million during the year
ended December 31, 1998, to $71 million for the year ended December 31,
1999, representing approximately 28% of total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1998 and 33% of total revenues for the year ended December 31,
1999. This increase was primarily a result of an increase in the number of
installed systems. Other revenue, consisting primarily of consulting
services and training, represented 12% and 14% of total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The increase in other
revenues as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to increased
consulting, project management and implementation services resulting from our
direct sales effort which began in April 1998.
Cost of Revenues
Licenses. Cost of licenses consist primarily of royalty payments to
third-party software vendors and costs of product media, duplication,
packaging and fulfillment. Cost of licenses increased from $434,000, or 4%
of license revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998, to $821,000, or 7%
of license revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999, primarily as a
result of the increased license revenue during the period and increased
amount of third party components sold by our direct sales staff.
Maintenance and Other. Cost of maintenance and other consists of the
direct and indirect costs of providing software maintenance and support,
training and consulting services, to our APs, OEMs and end-users. Cost of
maintenance and other increased from $33 million, or 44% of maintenance and
other revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998, to $39 million, or 38%
of maintenance and other revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
decrease as a percentage of maintenance and other revenues is primarily a
result of the leverage received from utilizing existing resources to service
our increased maintenance base.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries; commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing
personnel; marketing; advertising; and promotional expenses. Sales and
marketing expenses decreased from $130 million, or 70% of total revenues,
for the year ended December 31, 1998, to $110 million, or 50% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999. This decrease in sales and
marketing is primarily attributable to the closure of several Asian sales
offices in late 1998. We anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will
increase in absolute dollars in future quarters as we increase our current
sales force.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related expenses for research and development
personnel, and of the cost of facilities and equipment. Research and
development expenses increased in absolute dollars from $53 million, or 29%
of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998, to $56 million, or
26% of total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999. We expect
research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars
in 2000 to fund the development of new products and product enhancements.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative, executive
and financial personnel, and outside professional fees. General and
administrative expenses decreased from $27 million, or 15% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998, to $20 million, or 9% of
total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease was
primarily due to writing off or reserving Asian accounts receivable during
1998. General and administrative expenses are expected to remain constant in
2000.
Restructuring charges and other non-recurring charges. Due to the
economic status and instability in the Asian markets, we made the decision to
shut down two of our four Asian offices in the third quarter of 1998, thus
reducing future operational risks and cash outflows into the region. This
restructuring resulted in a $425,000 one-time write-off including $125,000 of
goodwill, $200,000 of severance costs and $100,000 of lease termination and
other costs. All actions relating to the restructuring plan were completed
during 1998 and no restructuring accruals remain as all cash payments had
been made as of December 31, 1998.
Other income, net. Other income, net consists primarily of interest due
to our investing activities offset by interest expense on our capitalized
lease obligations, and other debt and foreign currency translation
adjustments and transaction losses. We incurred other income, net of
$218,000 during the year ended December 31, 1998, compared to other income,
net of $300,000 during the year ended December 31, 1999. Other income for
1998 and 1999 was primarily a result of interest income derived from our
investment of our initial public offering proceeds offset by foreign currency
transaction and translation losses.
Benefit from Income Taxes. We have recorded a partial valuation allowance
against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it
is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near
term. Our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all
available evidence, both positive and negative. In particular we considered
both our historical results and our projections of profitability for only
reasonably foreseeable future periods. Our realization of the recorded net
deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore, we
cannot assure you that such benefits will be realized.
COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 TO DECEMBER 31, 1997
Revenues
Total revenues decreased 14% from $217 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997 to $185 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.
Licenses. License revenues decreased 30% from $159 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997 to $111 million for the year ended December 31,
1998, representing approximately 73% and 60%, respectively of total revenues
in both periods. Management believes that the decrease is primarily a result
of customers choosing to delay purchase decisions of the Company product
until the general release of Optika eMedia, which became commercially
available in late September 1998. License revenues generated outside of the
United States increased from approximately 23% of license revenues for the
year ended December 31, 1997 to approximately 32% of license revenues for the
year ended December 31, 1998.
Maintenance and Other. Maintenance revenues, exclusive of other revenues,
increased 40%, from approximately $37 million during the year ended December
31, 1997, to $52 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, representing
approximately 18% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1997 and
28% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase
was primarily a result of an increase in the number of installed systems.
Other revenue, consisting primarily of consulting services and training,
represented 9% and 12% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 1997
and 1998, respectively. The increase in other revenues as a percentage of
total revenues was primarily due to increased consulting, project management
and implementation services resulting from our direct sales effort which
began in April 1998.
Cost of Revenues
Licenses.  Cost of licenses consist primarily of royalty payments to
third-party software vendors and costs of product media, duplication,
packaging and fulfillment. Cost of licenses decreased from $737,000, or 5%
of license revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1997, to $434,000, or 4%
of license revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998, primarily as a
result of the decreased license revenue during the period.
Maintenance and Other. Cost of maintenance and other consists of the
direct and indirect costs of providing software maintenance and support,
training and consulting services, to our APs, OEMs and end-users, and the
cost of third-party software products. Cost of maintenance and other
increased from $28 million, or 49% of maintenance and other revenues, for
the year ended December 31, 1997, to $33 million, or 44% of maintenance and
other revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998. The decrease as a
percentage of maintenance and other revenues is primarily a result of the
leverage received from utilizing existing resources to service our increased
maintenance base.
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries; commissions and other related expenses for sales and marketing
personnel; marketing; advertising; and promotional expenses. Sales and
marketing expenses increased from $107 million, or 49% of total revenues,
for the year ended December 31, 1997, to $130 million, or 70% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily
attributable to additional costs resulting from the launch of eMedia, the
expansion of the North American sales staff and the further expansion of
staff during the year in sales offices in Brazil and Germany. In addition,
during 1998, we began paying commissions to APs on direct sales.
Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related expenses for research and development
personnel, and of the cost of facilities and equipment. Research and
development expenses increased from $50 million, or 23% of total revenues,
for the year ended December 31, 1997, to $53 million, or 29% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998.
General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries and other related expenses of administrative, executive
and financial personnel, and outside professional fees. General and
administrative expenses increased from $18 million, or 8% of total revenues,
for the year ended December 31, 1997, to $27 million, or 15% of total
revenues, for the year ended December 31, 1998. The increase was primarily
due to writing off or reserving Asian accounts receivable during 1998.
Restructuring charges and other non-recurring charges. During the fourth
quarter of 1997, we made the decision to exit the vertical healthcare
market. The restructuring plan involved the closure of our Boston facility,
and the termination of approximately 14 employees. We incurred a 1997
restructuring charge of $885,000 related to this restructuring consisting of
$422,000 of severance and benefits for terminated employees, $312,000 of
asset write-downs and leased facility executory costs, and $151,000 of other
costs related to the restructuring consisting principally of legal and other
miscellaneous costs. All actions relating to the restructuring plan were
completed during 1998 and no restructuring accruals remain as all cash
payments had been made as of December 31, 1998.
Due to the economic status and instability in the Asian markets, we made
the decision to shut down two of our four Asian offices in the third quarter
of 1998, thus reducing future operational risks and cash outflows into the
region. This restructuring resulted in a $425,000 one-time write-off
including $125,000 of goodwill, $200,000 of severance costs and $100,000 of
lease termination and other costs. All actions relating to the restructuring
plan were completed during 1998 and no restructuring accruals remain as all
cash payments had been made as of December 31, 1998.
Other income, net.  Other income, net consists primarily of interest
earned on our investing activities offset by interest expense on our
capitalized lease obligations, and other debt, and foreign currency
translation adjustments and transaction losses. We incurred other income,
net of $442,000 during the year ended December 31, 1997, compared to other
income, net of $218,000 during the year ended December 31, 1998. Other
income, net for 1997 and 1998 was primarily a result of interest income
derived from the investment of our initial public offering proceeds offset by
foreign currency transaction and translation losses.
Benefit from Income Taxes. We have recorded a partial valuation allowance
against our carryforward tax benefits to the extent that we believe that it
is more likely than not all of such benefits will not be realized in the near
term. Our assessment of this valuation allowance was made using all
available evidence, both positive and negative. In particular we considered
both our historical results and our projections of profitability for only
reasonably foreseeable future periods. Our realization of the recorded net
deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income and therefore, we
cannot assure you that such benefits will be realized.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 1999
were $72 million, decreasing approximately $629,000 from December 31, 1998.
The decrease in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments is
primarily due to our net loss for the year and capital expenditures
associated with computer equipment. For the year ended December 31, 1998,
net cash provided in operating activities was $106,000, compared to net cash
used of $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. The increase in cash
used from operating activities was due to a decrease in accounts receivable
collections.
Cash provided by investing activities was $31 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 compared to cash used of $36 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The increase in cash used by investing activities
consisted primarily of the purchase of short-term securities. Cash provided
from financing activities was $423,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998
compared to cash provided from financing activities of $484,000 for the year
ended December 31, 1999. Cash provided from financing activities resulted
primarily from proceeds of our issuance of common stock under our employee
stock purchase plan and stock option exercises.
At December 31, 1999, our principal sources of liquidity included cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments of $72 million. In addition, we
have a secured credit facility through October 2000 for up to $30 million,
bearing interest at the bank prime rate which was 85% at December 31,
1999. As of December 31, 1999, we had $28 million available for
borrowing.  Pursuant to the terms of the credit facility, any loans under
said facility are secured by all of our assets, with the exception of
intellectual property, and would be subject to certain covenants. We had no
other debt outstanding at December 31, 1999.
On February 23, 2000, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement, we
completed the sale of an aggregate of 731,851 shares of our Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock and warrant to purchase an aggregate of 307,298
shares of our common stock for the aggregate purchase price of $150 million.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, together with anticipated cash flow from operations and our bank
credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Thereafter, we may
require additional funds to support such activity through public or private
equity financing or from other sources. We cannot assure you that additional
financing will be available at all or that if available, such financing will
be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive.
YEAR 2000
We have experienced no significant Year 2000 issues in either our own
products or internal systems. We are not aware of any Year 2000 issues,
now or in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on us.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
We adopted Statement of Position 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition
SOP 97-2 for transactions entered into beginning in 1998. On December 31,
1998 Statement of Position 98-9, Modification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue
Recognition, with respect to certain transactions SOP 98-9, was issued
superseding SOP 98-4 and is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal
years beginning after March 15, 1999. SOP 97-2 has not had a material affect
on our current business practices or recognition of revenues. If our future
business practices involve the granting of specified upgrade rights to future
releases, extended payment terms, rights to additional products, subscription
licensing arrangements or other provisions impacted by SOP 97-2, as amended
by SOP 98-4 and SOP 98-9, the SOP may have a material impact on the timing of
our revenue recognition and could result in the deferral of significant
amounts of revenues.
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivatives and
Hedging Activities,SFAS No. 133 as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133,
which establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts, and for hedging activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The adoption of
Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 is not expected to have
a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash
flows as we do not currently hold derivative instruments or engage in hedging
activities.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
As of December 31, 1999 we had $38 million in short-term investments
that are sensitive to market risks. Our investment portfolio is used to
preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations, including our
research and development activities. We do not own any derivative financial
instruments. Due to the nature of our investment portfolio we are primarily
subject to interest rate risk.
Our investment portfolio includes fixed rate debt instruments that are
primarily United States government and agency bonds of duration ranging from
one to five years. The market value of these bonds is subject to interest
rate risk, and could decline in value if interest rates decrease. Any
material change in the interest rates would have a material change in the
market value of our debt instruments. A hypothetical increase or decrease in
market interest rates by 10% from December 31, 1999 would cause the fair
market value of these short-term investments to change by an insignificant
amount. Although the market value of these short-term investments would
change due to the interest rate fluctuation, we have the ability to hold the
investments to maturity, which would reduce overall market risk.
