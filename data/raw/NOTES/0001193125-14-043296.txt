Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts 
1.BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Company Monster Worldwide,
Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, Monster, Monster Worldwide, we, our, or us has operations that consist of three reportable segments:
Careers-North America, Careers-International and Internet Advertising Fees. Revenue in the Companys Careers segments is primarily earned from the placement of job advertisements on the websites within the Monster network, access to
the Monster network of online resume databases, recruitment media services and other career-related services. Revenue in the Companys Internet Advertising Fees segment is primarily earned from the display of advertisements on the
Monster network of websites, click-throughs on text based links and leads provided to advertisers. The Companys Careers segments provide online services to customers in a variety of industries throughout North America, Europe, and
the Asia-Pacific region, while Internet Advertising Fees delivers online services primarily in North America. Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Investments
in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary, but has the ability to exert significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. All inter-company accounts and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The noncontrolling interest in our South Korean subsidiary is recorded net of tax as Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. We have reclassified certain amounts previously reported in our financial
statements to conform to the current presentation, including amounts related to discontinued operations. Unless noted otherwise, discussions in these notes pertain to our continuing operations. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses. These estimates include, among others, allowances for doubtful accounts, fair value of financial assets and liabilities, net realizable values on long-lived assets and
deferred tax assets and liabilities, certain accrued expense accounts, deferred revenue, goodwill, revenue recognition and forfeitures associated with stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes
revenue on agreements in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Careers-North
America and Careers-International. Our Careers-North America and Careers-International segments primarily earn revenue from the placement of job postings on the websites within the Monster network, access to the Monster networks online
resume database, recruitment media services, applicant tracking services, online career related solutions provided through a Software as a Service SaaS offering and other career-related services. 
Where appropriate, we recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ASU No2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements, which was effective January1, 2011, revenue associated with multiple element contracts is based on the selling price hierarchy, which includes vendor-specific objective evidence or VSOE when available,
third-party evidence TPE if it is available and if VSOE is not available, if neither is available, then the best estimate of selling price would be used. Under this new accounting guidance, to treat elements in a multi-element
arrangement as separate units of accounting, each element must have standalone value upon delivery. If the element has standalone value, the Company accounts for each element separately. In determining whether elements have standalone value, the
Company considers the availability of the elements from other vendors, the nature of the elements, the timing of execution of contracts for customers and the contractual dependence of the element related to a customers acceptance. 
We recognize revenue at the time that job postings and related accessories are displayed on the Monster network websites, based upon customer usage patterns.
Revenue earned from subscriptions to the Monster networks resume database, applicant tracking services and other career-related services are recognized over the length of the underlying subscriptions, typically from two weeks to twelve months.
The Company accounts for SaaS contracts as the services are being performed. 
47 Table of Contents
Unearned revenues are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue. We review accounts receivable for those
that may potentially be uncollectible and any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible are included in our allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written
off against the allowance. Internet Advertising Fees. Our Internet Advertising Fees segment primarily earns revenue from the
display of advertisements on the Monster network of websites, click-throughs on text based links, leads provided to advertisers and subscriptions to premium services. We recognize revenue for online advertising as impressions
are delivered. An impression is delivered when an advertisement appears in pages viewed by our users. We recognize revenue from the display of click-throughs on text based links as click-throughs occur. A click-through occurs when a user
clicks on an advertisers listing. Revenue from lead generation is recognized as leads are delivered to advertisers. Business Combinations
We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC805, Business Combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires
that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values on the date of a business combination. Our consolidated financial statements and results of operations reflect an acquired business from the completion date of an
acquisition. Discontinued Operations The
Company accounts for business dispositions and its businesses held for sale in accordance with ASC205-20, Discontinued Operations. ASC 205-20 requires the results of operations of business dispositions to be segregated from continuing
operations and reflected as discontinued operations in current and prior periods. Please see Note6-Discontinued Operations to the consolidated financial statements. 
Marketing and Promotion Advertising production
costs are recorded as expense the first time an advertisement appears. Costs of communicating advertising are recorded as expense as advertising space or airtime is used. All other advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying
amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial
instruments. The Companys debt relates to borrowings under its credit facilities and term loan, which approximates fair value due to market interest rates. 
Concentrations of Risk Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the
amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand. The Company also invests in short-term commercial paper rated P1 or better by Moodys or A1 or better by Standard Poors. The Company
performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers, maintains allowances for potential credit losses and does not require collateral. The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on
managements evaluation of the customers financial condition, past collection history and overall aging of the receivables. Historically, such losses have been within managements expectations. The Company has not experienced
significant losses related to receivables from individual customers or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. Cash and
Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, which primarily consist of bank time deposits and commercial paper, are stated at cost, which
approximates fair value. For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all highly liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Outstanding checks in excess of account balances,
typically payroll and other contractual obligations disbursed on or near the last day of a reporting period, are reported as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
48 Table of Contents
Accounts Receivable 
The Companys accounts receivable primarily consist of trade receivables. Management reviews accounts receivable on a monthly basis to determine if any
receivables will potentially be uncollectible. The Company includes any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be uncollectible in its allowance for doubtful accounts. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the
receivable is written off against the allowance. Based on the information available, the Company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts as of December31, 2013 and 2012 are adequate. However, actual write-offs could exceed the recorded
allowance. Including discontinued operations, the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows:  Year Ended December31 BeginningBalance ChargedtoExpense Write-Offsand Other EndingBalance 2013 4,721 2,367 3,093 3,995 2012 5,240 4,469 4,988 4,721 2011 5,420 3,329 3,509 5,240
Included in the December31, 2012 ending balance of $4,721 is $796 of allowance for doubtful accounts attributable to
discontinued operations. Property and Equipment 
Computer and communications equipment, furniture and equipment and capitalized software costs are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight line
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, or the lease term, whichever is shorter.
Internal Use Software and Website Development Costs 
In accordance with ASC350-40, Internal-Use Software, the Company capitalizes costs to purchase or internally develop software for internal use, as
well as costs incurred to design, develop, test and implement enhancements to its website. These costs are included in property and equipment and the estimated useful life is five years. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets The Company
evaluates its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC350-20, Goodwill. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net
identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. The Company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is tested more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. Prior to the sale of Careers-China on February5, 2013, the Company had
four reporting units which were equivalent to our four operating segments: Careers-North America, Careers-International, Careers-China, presented for all periods as a discontinued operation, and Internet Advertising Fees. Following the
sale of the Careers-China business, the Company has three reporting units which are equivalent to our three operating segments: Careers-North America, Careers-International, and Internet Advertising Fees. 
In determining if goodwill is impaired, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of
that reporting unit. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach depending on the availability of relevant market comparable information.
Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating
margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related
to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates the fair value based on market multiples of cash flow and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar
operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and further considering the value of a control premium. The weighting of the fair value derived from the market approach differs for each reporting unit depending on the level of
comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Other intangible assets primarily consist of the value of customer relationships, trade names, resume databases, trademarks and internet domains. Amortizable
intangible assets are primarily being amortized on a basis that approximates economic use, over periods ranging from two to ten years. 
49 Table of Contents
Intangible assets are primarily evaluated on an annual basis, generally in conjunction with the Companys
evaluation of goodwill balances. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset, the useful
life over which cash flows will occur, their amount and the assets residual value, if any. In turn, measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value, which is based on the best information available. The Company uses
internal discounted cash flows estimates, quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals, as appropriate, to determine fair value. The Company derives the required cash flow estimates from historical experience and internal business
plans and applies an appropriate discount rate. As of December31, 2013, there were no impairment indicators present. Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual
disposition are less than their carrying amounts. As of December 31, 2013, there were no impairment indicators present. Foreign Currency
Translation and Transactions The financial position and results of operations of the Companys foreign subsidiaries are determined using
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the
year. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in other comprehensive loss income, a component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses resulting from other foreign currency
transactions, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are included in interest and other, net. Comprehensive loss income is defined to include
all changes in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. The Companys items of other comprehensive loss income are foreign currency translation adjustments, which relate to investments that are
permanent in nature, net of applicable income taxes. To the extent that such amounts relate to investments that are permanent in nature, no adjustments for income taxes are made. 
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts as economic cash flow hedges to offset risks related to foreign currency transactions. These
transactions primarily relate to non-functional currency denominated inter-company funding loans and non-functional currency inter-company accounts receivable. The Company does not trade derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Please see Note 11-Financial Derivative Instruments. Income Taxes 
We utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC740, Income Taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes
are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse. A valuation allowance is
recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and
negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of taxable temporary items, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Assumptions used in making this evaluation require significant judgment and are
consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. When we determine that we are not able to realize our recorded deferred tax assets, an increase in the valuation allowance is recorded, decreasing earnings in
the period in which such determination is made. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based
upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where there is greater than 50% likelihood that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax
benefit that may potentially be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where there is a 50% or less likelihood that a tax benefit will be
sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. 
50 Table of Contents
Stock-Based Compensation 
We award stock options, non-vested stock, market-based non-vested stock and performance-based non-vested stock to employees, directors and executive officers.
We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. In accordance with ASC 718, we use the fair-market value of the Companys Common Stock on the date the award is approved to measure fair value for
service-based and performance-based awards, a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine both the fair value and requisite service period of market-based awards and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option
awards. Compensation expense for stock option awards and service-based awards is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. For market-based awards, compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period as derived using a
Monte Carlo simulation model. For performance-based awards, compensation expense is recognized based on the probability of achieving the performance conditions associated with the respective shares, as determined by management. 
Restructuring and Other Special Charges The
Company accounts for restructuring activities in accordance with ASC420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. Under the guidance, for the cost of restructuring activities that do not constitute a discontinued operation, the liability for
the current and fair value of expected future costs associated with such restructuring activity shall be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred. We segregate the costs of restructuring activities taken pursuant to a management
approved restructuring plan. Operating Lease Obligations 
We recognize a liability for costs to terminate an operating lease obligation before the end of its term when we no longer derive economic benefit from the
lease. The liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when we determine that the cease use date has occurred and the fair value of the liability is determined based on the remaining lease rentals due, reduced by estimated sublease rental
income that could be reasonably obtained for the property. The estimate of subsequent sublease rental income may change and require future changes to the fair value of the liabilities for the lease obligations. 
Earnings Loss Per Share Attributable to Monster Worldwide, Inc. 
Basic earnings loss per share is calculated using the Companys weighted-average outstanding common shares. When the effects are dilutive, diluted

December31, 2013. 
4. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
The Company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is
tested more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level. Prior to the sale of Careers-China on February5, 2013, the Company had four reporting units which were equivalent
to our four operating segments: Careers-North America, Careers-International, Careers-China, presented for all periods as a discontinued operation, and Internet Advertising Fees. Following the sale of the Careers-China business, the
Company has three reporting units which are equivalent to our three operating segments: Careers-North America, Careers-International, and Internet Advertising Fees. 
In determining if goodwill is impaired, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of
that reporting unit. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach, depending on the availability of relevant market comparable information.
Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on managements estimates of revenue growth rates and operating
margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related
to the businesss ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, the Company estimates the fair value based on market multiples of cash flow and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar
operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium. The weighting of the fair value derived from the market approach differs for each reporting unit depending on the level of comparability of
these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
54 Table of Contents
For the annual goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2013, each of the
Careers-International and the Internet Advertising Fees reporting units had fair value that substantially exceeded its carrying value. For the Careers-North America reporting unit, the Company calculated, using a discount rate of 14% and a
terminal growth rate of 28% that the fair value would have to be at least 22% less than the computed amount to result in any goodwill impairment charges. The recorded amount of goodwill for the Careers-North America reporting unit was $598,114 as
of December31, 2013. The Company believes the inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Careers-North America reporting unit are reasonable. 
During the third quarter of 2012, the Company performed a qualitative analysis for the Careers-China reporting unit and it was determined that the
Careers-China reporting unit was more likely than not to have a fair value less than the units carrying amount. The conclusion was based on the recent financial performance of Careers-China compared to previously forecasted results, updated
projections of future profitability as well as indicative offers from potential buyers of the Careers-China business please see Note 6-Discontinued Operations. Accordingly, the Company performed a step one fair value evaluation of
Careers-China utilizing both a discounted cash flow analysis and the indicative offers from potential buyers of the Careers-China business. The result of this fair value analysis was that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the
carrying value and a step two analysis was required to determine the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The Company performed the step two evaluation and determined that the goodwill for the Careers-China reporting unit was impaired and recorded
a goodwill impairment charge for Careers-China of $216,221. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company impaired the remaining goodwill balance of the Careers-China business and recorded an additional $46,429 impairment, leaving the Careers-China
business with no goodwill. As a corroborative source of information, the Company reconciles the estimated fair values of its reporting units to within a
reasonable range of its market capitalization, which includes an assumed control premium an adjustment reflecting an estimated fair value on a control basis to verify the reasonableness of the fair value of its reporting units obtained through the
aforementioned methods. The control premium is estimated based upon control premiums observed in comparable market transactions. As none of our reporting units are publicly-traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations do not directly
correlate to the Companys stock price. Although the Company believes it is reasonable to conclude that market capitalization could be an indicator of fair value over time, we believe that our current market capitalization undervalues the
aggregate fair values of our individual reporting units. The Company recognizes that during certain periods our market capitalization has been below our
book value. Accordingly, we monitor changes in our share price to ensure that our reconciled market capitalization continues to exceed or is not significantly below the carrying value of our net assets. In the event that our reconciled market
capitalization does decline below its book value, we consider the length and severity of the decline and the reason for the decline when assessing whether potential goodwill impairment exists. Further, if a reporting unit does not appear to be
achieving the projected growth plan used in determining its fair value, we will reevaluate the reporting unit for potential goodwill impairment based on revised projections, as available. 
A summary of changes in goodwill by reportable segment are as follows:  Careers-NorthAmerica Careers-International InternetAdvertising Fees Total Balance as of December31, 2011 594,094 386,477 151,590 1,132,161 Impairment of Careers China 262,650 262,650 Translation and other, net 17,760 17,760

8.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT 
The Company values its assets and liabilities using the methods of fair value as described in ASC820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures. ASC820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are described below: 
Level1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
Level2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities. Level3 Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect
managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. In determining fair value, the Company
utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible, and considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Observable or market inputs reflect
market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Companys assumptions based on the best information available. There have been no transfers of assets or liabilities between the fair value measurement
classifications in the year ended December31, 2013.

We recognize a liability for costs to terminate an operating lease obligation before the end of its term when we no longer
derive economic benefit from the lease. The lease exit liabilities within the Level 3 tier relate to vacated facilities associated with previously discontinued operations and restructuring activities of the Company and are recorded in accrued
expenses and other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The liability is recognized and measured based on a discounted cash flow model when the cease use date has occurred. The fair value of the liability is determined based on
the remaining lease rentals due, reduced by estimated sublease rental income that could be reasonably obtained for the property. The changes in the fair
value of the Level3 liabilities are as follows:  Lease Exit LiabilityYearendedDecember31 2013 2012 Balance, Beginning of Period 14,233 14,938 Expense 6,225 5,511 Cash Payments and changes in fair value 7,908 6,216

credit facility and $40,000 for the term loan. The revolving credit facility and the term loan facility each mature on March22, 2015. The Second Amended Credit Agreement does not qualify as a debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470
Debt, and all financing fees incurred will be deferred and amortized through March 2015. The Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments on the outstanding principal amount of the term loan with $1,875 payable on
March31, 2014, $2,500 payable on each of June30, 2014,September30, 2014 andDecember31, 2014 and the remaining balance of the term loan due at maturity. 
Borrowings under the Second Amended Credit Agreement will bear interest at a rate equal to either ithe British Bankers Association LIBOR BBA
LIBOR Rate plus a margin ranging from 250 basis points to 325 basis points depending on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio or iithe sum of Athe highest of 1the agents prime rate, 2the sum of
050% plus the overnight federal funds rate on such day or 3the BBA LIBOR plus 10%, and Ba margin ranging from 150 basis points to 225 basis points depending on the Companys consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the
Company will be required to pay the following fees: ia fee on all outstanding amounts of letters of credit at a rate per annum ranging from 250 basis points to 325 basis points depending on the consolidated leverage ratio; and iia

of this credit facility was $89,375 in borrowings on the term loan facility, $45,900 of borrowings on the revolving credit facility, and $311 in outstanding letters of credit. The portion of the term loan that is due within one year is $9,375 and is
classified as short-term in the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining amount outstanding on the term loan and the utilized portion of the revolving credit facility is classified as long-term in the consolidated balance sheet. As of
December31, 2013, based on the calculation of the maximum consolidated leverage ratio, $178,789 of the Companys revolving credit facility was available. At December31, 2013, the one month BBA LIBOR rate, the agents prime

Net deferred tax liabilities assets 15,947 18,617 
As of December31, 2013 and 2012, net current deferred tax assets were $627 and $1,123, respectively, net current
deferred tax liabilities were $49 and $47, respectively, net non-current deferred tax assets were $20,405 and $21,248, respectively, and net non-current deferred tax liabilities were $36,930 and $3,707, respectively. 
At December, 31, 2013, the Company has United StatesFederal net operating tax losses of approximately $11,600 which it expects to carry forward as no
carry-back refunds are available. The loss expires in 2031. The Company has foreign tax credit carryovers of $48,107 that expire in stages beginning in 2016 through 2023. The Company has net operating loss carry-forwards in various foreign countries
around the world of approximately $238,717, approximately $169,037 of which have no expiration date and $69,680 of which expire in stages in years 2013 through 2027. The Company realized a cash benefit relating to the use of its tax loss
carryforwards of $25,122 and $15,546 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. 
65 Table of Contents
Utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards may be subject to substantial annual
limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the United States Internal Revenue Code. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards before their utilization. The
events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than 50% over a three year period. 
Realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company generating sufficient taxable income in future years in the
appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain a benefit from the reversal of deductible temporary differences and from attribute carry-forwards which include losses and tax credits. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company has
considered all positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial performance. Since this evaluation requires considerable judgment
and consideration of events that may occur in future years, our conclusion could be materially different if certain of our expectations do not occur. To the extent actual results are different, it may require a material charge to income in the
period in which such events occur. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets cannot be used in the
foreseeable future, principally net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions. In addition the Company has recorded a valuation allowance on U.S. tax credits for foreign taxes paid. Determining the amount of valuation allowance required
necessitates significant judgment. We review utilization of tax assets on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis and consider such factors as recent operating history and future business forecasts. In making this assessment we give greater weight to
evidence that is objectively verifiable comprising primarily of past operating history and reversing taxable differences. Operations in certain countries have a long history of continual tax losses, so a valuation allowance has been recorded on all
of their attributes. The income tax provision from continuing operations was increased by approximately $5,221 and $5,991 in 2013 and 2012 respectively
due to valuation allowances, approximately $1,691 and $3,000 of which related to deferred tax assets that existed at the beginning of year. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $4,472 in 2013 primarily due to the effect of enacted
reductions in the tax rates on deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance, or expiration of tax losses with a full valuation allowance, and was increased by $3,379 in 2012 due to reversals of unrecognized tax benefits with full valuation
allowances. These additional items did not result in a net charge or benefit to the tax provision. Income taxes related to the Companys income from
operations before loss in equity interests differ from the amount computed using the Federal statutory income tax rate as follows:  Year Ended December31 2013 2012 2011 Income taxes at Federal statutory rate 9,598 9,195 31,778 State income taxes, net of Federal income tax effect 1,152 217 43 Foreign tax rate differences 3,510 1,655 4,534 Change in valuation allowance 749 9,370 1,419 Reversals of accrued income tax 12,391 28,814 5,371 Interest expense on tax liabilities, net of reversals 189 3,517 1,735 Earnings not indefinitely reinvested 676 1,303 1,616 Non-deductible compensation and other expenses 1,506 1,095 3,549 Effect of foreign branch incorporation 4,478 Tax effect of restructuring items 21,754 Effect of intercompany loans 250 1,728 2,167 Sale of noncontrolling interest 18,143 
Provision for benefit from income taxes 23,004 32,978 23,504 
For the years ended December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 the Company has recorded a tax benefit provision in discontinued
operations of $6,407, $1,624 and $5,130, respectively. These amounts include a provision of $0, $9,710 and $591, respectively, for valuation allowances on recorded deferred tax assets relating to Careers-China. In the years ended December31,
2013, 2012 and 2011, the discontinued operation tax provision include tax benefits of $540, $8,086 and $1,461, respectively, on certain tax losses in discontinued operations that pass through to continuing operations due to the form of ownership.

A provision has not been made for United Statesor additional foreign taxes on substantially all
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Company plans to utilize these undistributed earnings to finance expansion or operating requirements of subsidiaries outside of the United States or due to local country restrictions. Such
earnings will continue to be indefinitely reinvested but could become subject to additional tax if they were remitted as dividends or were loaned to the Company or United Statesaffiliates, or if the Company should sell its stock in the foreign
subsidiaries. Due to various complexities in computing the residual US tax liability particularly when the timing or form of future repatriations has not been determined, it is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax, if any, that
might be payable on undistributed foreign earnings. The Company estimates its undistributed foreign earnings for which deferred taxes have not been provided are approximately $24,107. 
The Company evaluates its reinvestment assertions with respect to foreign earnings at each reporting period. During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company
changed its reinvestment assertion with respect to unremitted earnings in South Korea. In 2013, 2012 and 2011, the Company repatriated approximately $13,385, $38,000, and $0 respectively, of cash from its subsidiary in South Korea. In November 2013,
the Company entered in to an agreement to sell a 4999% interest in JobKorea Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary in South Korea, to HQ Korea for an aggregate purchase price of $90,000. The transaction, which is accounted for as a sale of a
noncontrolling interest resulted in a sale for tax purposes. A tax provision of $30,853 was recorded on the transaction of which $12,709 was charged to stockholders equity and $18,143 was charged to the continuing operations tax provision. The
Company utilized substantially all of its existing U.S. tax operating loss carryovers to offset the tax liability that would otherwise be due on the transaction. As a result of the sale the remaining 5001% investment retained by the Company is
owned through an entity characterized as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes. Accordingly, the Companys share of future earnings will be generally taxable in the United States, as if distributed. 
As of December31, 2013 and 2012, the Company has recorded a liability for $53,078 and $63,465, respectively, which includes unrecognized tax benefits of
$30,005 and $40,075, respectively, and estimated accrued interest and penalties of $23,074 and $23,390, respectively. Interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of income tax expense in the
consolidated statement of operations. Interest accrued on unrecognized tax benefits included in the 2013, 2012 and 2011 income tax provision in the statement of operations was $2,932, $3,794, and $4,838, respectively. In 2013, 2012 and 2011 interest
expense was recorded net of reversals of prior years interest and penalties of $3,248, $9,609, and $1,967 respectively. The net of tax effect of interest, penalties and reversals thereof was a credit of $189 and $3,517 in the years ended
December31, 2013 and 2012, respectively and a charge of $1,735 in the year ended December31, 2011. A reconciliation of the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:  2013 2012 2011 Balance, beginning of period 40,075 76,818 81,815 Gross increases: tax positions taken in prior periods 515 8,380 Gross decreases: tax positions taken in prior periods 13,042 8,943 5,056 Gross increases: tax positions taken in current year 2,457 3,114 2,829 Gross decreases: tax positions taken in current year Gross decreases: settlement of tax examinations 39,294 2,770 
Balance, end of period 30,005 40,075 76,818 
If the unrecognized tax benefits at December31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were recognized in full, $30,005, $40,075, and
$76,818, respectively, would impact the effective tax rate. During 2013, the Company recognized previously unrecognized tax positions of $12,979 which on
a net of tax basis favorably impacted the effective rate by $12,391 as a result of settlements of tax examinations and lapses of statutes of limitations. The Company also reversed accrued interest on unrecognized tax positions of $3,248, which
favorably impacted the effective rate by $1,963. The tax matters reversed relate primarily to characterization of certain intercompany loans for tax purposes and allocation of income among jurisdictions.

During 2012, the Company completed a tax examination with the United States Internal Revenue Service which
covered the tax years 2006 through 2009. As a result of settlement of this tax examination the Company recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits of $38,024 and reversed an asset for recoverable foreign taxes of $7,956 both of which, on a net
of tax basis, impacted the effective rate by $29,059. The Company also recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits of $5,680 which were offset in full by a valuation allowance and had no net effect on the tax provision. The Company also reversed
accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of $8,034 which, on a net of tax basis, impacted the effective rate by $4,860. The tax matters recognized related to the allocation of income among tax jurisdiction and the benefits related to
certain tax net operating losses. In addition, the Company settled certain state and local tax examinations and revised certain estimates to prior accrued state liabilities. As a result, the Company recognized $1,806 of previously unrecognized tax
benefits and reversed accrued interest related to these unrecognized benefits of $1,575 which together on a net of tax basis impacted the effective tax rate by $2,128. Additionally, the Company increased its tax provision for unrecognized tax
benefits of $7,100 relating to an ongoing international tax examination. The total effect on the tax provision for the year ended December31, 2012, due to adjustments of prior accruals and settlement of tax examinations, was a tax benefit of
$28,814, a benefit for reversal of interest of $5,814, and a provision for recording a valuation allowance of $5,680. During 2011, the Company recognized
previously unrecognized federal tax benefits due to an adjustment of $3,570 to the accrual for certain prior year tax positions and effective settlement of state and local tax examinations in the United States. As a result of the effective
settlement of tax examinations, the Company recognized $2,770 of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which on a net of tax basis, impacted the effective tax rate by $1,801. The Company also reversed accrued interest related to unrecognized tax
benefits of $1,967, which on a net of tax basis, impacted the effective tax rate by $1,190. The total benefit reflected in the tax provision for the year ended December31, 2011, due to adjustments of prior accruals and settlement of tax
examinations, was a reversal of prior year tax of $5,371 and a benefit for reversal of interest of $1,190. The Company conducts business globally and as
a result, the Company or one or more subsidiaries is subject to United Statesfederal income taxes and files income tax returns in various states and approximately 40foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is
subject to tax examinations by taxing authorities including major jurisdictions such as Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States as well as other countries in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region. The Company is generally no longer subject to
examinations with respect to returns that have been filed for years prior to 2006 in Germany, 2011 in the United Kingdom, and 2009 in the United States. Tax years are generally considered closed from examinations when the statute of limitations
expires. The United States Internal Revenue Service has recently commenced a tax examination which covers tax years 2010-2012. No adjustments have been proposed as the examination is in a very early stage. 
The Company estimates that it is reasonably possible that unrecorded tax benefits may be reduced by an amount ranging from $0 to $14,000 in the next twelve
months due to expirations of statutes of limitations or settlement of examinations.

Earnings per share calculations for each quarter include the weighted average effect of stock issuances and common stock equivalents for the quarter; therefore, the sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts may not
equal full-year earnings per share amounts, which reflect the weighted average effect on an annual basis. Diluted earnings per share calculations for each quarter include the effect of stock options, non-vested restricted stock units and non-vested
restricted stock, when dilutive to the quarter. In addition, basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share may not add due to rounding.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Monster Worldwide maintains disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule13a-15e, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Companys management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives and the Companys management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. The Company has carried out an evaluation, as
of the end of the period covered by this report, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were
reasonably effective in ensuring that material information relating to the Company is made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
The Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Securities
Exchange Act Rules13a-15f or 15d-15f. The Companys internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of
published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems
determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Companys
management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
COSO in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework 1992. Based on this assessment, the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believe that as of December31, 2013
the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. There have been no significant changes in the
Companys internal controls or in other factors which could materially affect internal controls subsequent to the date the Companys management carried out its evaluation. 
The Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Board of Directors and Stockholders Monster Worldwide, Inc.
New York, New York We have audited Monster Worldwide,
Inc.s the Company internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework 1992 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission the COSO criteria. The Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A companys internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; 2provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Monster Worldwide, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the consolidated balance sheets of Monster Worldwide, Inc. as of December31, 2013 and 2012 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2013 and our report dated February10, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
