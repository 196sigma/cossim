46 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Rush Enterprises, Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rush
Enterprises, Inc., a Texas corporation, and subsidiaries as of
December31, 2002 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December31, 2003.
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Rush
Enterprises, Inc., and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December31, 2003, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. As
discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill
and other Intangible Assets.

ENTERPRISES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS Rush Enterprises, Inc. the Company was incorporated in June 1996
under the laws of the State of Texas.
The Company, founded in 1965, now operates a Heavy-Duty Truck segment, a
Construction Equipment segment and a Retail segment. The Heavy-Duty Truck segment operates a regional network of 37
truck centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the trucking needs
of its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty
trucks; parts, service and body shop facilities; and financial services,
including assisting in the financing of new and used truck purchases, insurance
products and truck leasing and rentals.
The Companys truck centers are located in areas on or near major
highways in Texas, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arizona, Florida, Alabama
and New Mexico. The Construction
Equipment segment, formed during 1997, operates a John Deere equipment center
in Houston, Texas. A portion of this
segment, that operated five John Deere Equipment Centers in Michigan, was
discontinued during 2002 see Note 3.
Dealership operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment,
aftermarket parts and service facilities, equipment rentals and the financing
of new and used equipment see Note 19.
The Retail segments primary line of business is the retail sale of farm
and ranch supplies including fencing, horse and cattle trailers, veterinarian
supplies and western wear. The Retail segment is currently operating as a
discontinued operation pending disposal see Note 3. In February 2003, the Company acquired the common stock of Orange
County Truck and Trailers, Inc. Orange County, a Peterbilt dealer in
central Florida. The acquisition
provides Rush with the exclusive rights to sell Peterbilt trucks and parts from
three new locations in central Florida, including Orlando, Haines City, and
Tampa. The transaction was valued at
approximately $54 million, with the purchase price paid in cash. In April 2003, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc., which consisted of a dealership location in Mobile,
Alabama. Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc.s
primary line of business is the sale of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty
trucks, parts and service. The
transaction was valued at approximately $14 million, with the purchase price
paid in cash. As part of the Companys corporate reorganization in connection with
its initial public offering Offering in June 1996, the Company acquired, as
a wholly owned subsidiary, a managing general agent the MGA to manage all
of the operations of Associated Acceptance, Inc. AA. W. Marvin Rush, the sole shareholder of AA,
is prohibited from the sale or transfer of the capital stock of AA under the
MGA agreement, except as designated by the Company. Therefore, the financial position and operations of AA have 52 been included as part of the Companys consolidated financial position
and results of operations for all periods presented. Effective at the close of business on July 9, 2002 the Record Date,
pursuant to action taken by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting of the
Company held July 9, 2002, and described in the Proxy Statement dated May 15,
2002, the Board of Directors of the Company reclassified the outstanding common
stock, $001 par value per share the Old Common Stock, as Class B Common
Stock, $001 par value per share the Class B Common Stock, and declared a
stock dividend of one share of a new Class A Common Stock, $01 par value per
share, for each share of Class B Common Stock held by shareholders of record on
the Record Date. Each share of Class A Common Stock ranks substantially equal
to each share of Class B Common Stock with respect to receipt of any dividends
or distributions declared on shares of common stock and the right to receive
proceeds on liquidation or dissolution of the Company after payment of the
Companys indebtedness and liquidation preference payments to holders of
preferred shares. However, holders of
Class A Common Stock will have 1/20th of one vote per share on all
matters requiring a shareholder vote, while holders of Class B Common Stock
will retain their full vote per share.
The Companys stock trades on the NASDAQ National Market under the
symbols RUSHA and RUSHB. Prior to the
reclassification and stock dividend, the Company had 7,002,044 shares of Old
Common Stock outstanding. Subsequent to
the reclassification and stock dividend, the Company had 7,002,044 shares of
Class A Common Stock and 7,002,044 shares of Class B Common Stock
outstanding. Additionally, all stock
option information in Note 13 has been adjusted to reflect the above
transaction for all periods presented.
The adjustment has caused the total number of options to double, and the
grant price per option to be reduced by 50%. All significant interdivision and intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified for
comparative purposes. 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Estimates in Financial Statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
UnitedStates generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by specific
identification for new and used truck and construction equipment inventory and
by the 53 first-in, first-out method for tires, parts and accessories. An allowance is provided when it is
anticipated that cost will exceed net realizable value. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the useful life of the improvement, or the term of the lease,
whichever is shorter. Provision for
depreciation of property and equipment is calculated primarily on a
straight-line basis. The Company
capitalizes interest on borrowings during the active construction period of
major capital projects. Capitalized
interest, when incurred, is added to the cost of underlying assets and is
amortized over the estimated useful life of such assets. The Company did not incur any capitalized
interest related to major capital projects in the periods presented. The cost, accumulated depreciation and
amortization and estimated useful lives are summarized as follows in
thousands

54 Allowance for Doubtful Receivables and Repossession Losses The Company provides an allowance for doubtful receivables and
repossession losses after considering historical loss experience and other
factors, which might affect the collection of accounts receivable and the
ability of customers to meet their obligations on finance contracts sold by the
Company. Other Assets Other assets consist primarily of goodwill related to acquisitions of
approximately $377million as of December 31, 2002 and $425million
as of December 31, 2003. Accumulated
amortization of other assets at December31, 2002 was approximately $44
million and at December 31, 2003 was approximately $46 million. Annually, the Company assesses the
appropriateness of the asset valuations of other assets and the related
amortization period if applicable. Financial Accounting Standards
Board FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS
142, addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and
other intangible assets and supersedes APB Opinion No. 17, Intangible Assets. SFAS 142 addresses how intangible assets
that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those
acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial
statements upon their acquisition. SFAS
142 also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted
for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements. The provisions of SFAS 142 became effective
January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 is required
to be applied at the beginning of an entitys fiscal year and to be applied to
all goodwill and other intangible assets recognized in its financial statements
at that date. Impairment losses for
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that arise due to the initial
application of SFAS 142 are to be reported as resulting from a change in
accounting principle. The Company completed its initial impairment review and
recorded no impairment charges in its financial statements at the date of
adoption. However, the Company is exposed to the possibility that changes in
market conditions could result in significant impairment charges in the future,
thus resulting in a potential increase in earnings volatility. In addition, as a result of SFAS 142, the
Companys amortization expense is lower as the Company no longer amortizes
goodwill. Assuming the adoption of SFAS
142 had occurred at the beginning of 2001, net income and earnings per share
would have been as follows for the three years ended December 31, 2003 in thousands 55

Included in the Loss from discontinued operations above for 2002 are
goodwill impairment losses, net of taxes, of $13 million, related to the sale
of the Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores, and $09 million,
related to the pending sale of the Seguin DD store see Note 3. The Company has completed its impairment review for goodwill related to
continuing operations at December 31, 2003 and recorded no impairment charges
in its financial statements. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No109, Accounting for Income Taxes
SFAS109. SFAS109
requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected
future tax consequences of events that have been included in a companys
financial statements or tax returns.
Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined
based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of
assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the
years in which the differences are expected to reverse. 56 Revenue Recognition Policies Income on the sale of vehicles and construction equipment
collectively, unit is recognized when the seller and customer execute a
purchase contract, delivery has occurred and there are no significant
uncertainties related to financing or collectibility. Finance income related to the sale of a unit is recognized over
the period of the respective finance contract, based on the effective interest
rate method, if the finance contract is retained by the Company. During 2001, 2002 and 2003, no finance
contracts were retained for any significant length of time by the Company but
were generally sold, with limited recourse, to certain finance companies
concurrent with the sale of the related unit.
Gain or loss is recognized by the Company upon the sale of such finance
contracts to the finance companies, net of a provision for estimated
repossession losses and early repayment penalties. Lease and rental income is recognized over the period of the
related lease or rental agreement.
Parts and services revenue is earned at the time the Company sells the
parts to its customers or at the time the Company completes the service work
order related to service provided to the customers unit. Payments received on prepaid maintenance plans
are deferred as a component of accrued expenses and recognized as income when
the maintenance is performed. Stock Options In October 1995, Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS123, was issued.
SFAS123 defines a fair value based method of accounting for
employee stock options or similar equity instruments and encourages all
entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock
compensation plans. Under the fair value
based method, compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
value of the award and is recognized over the service period of the award,
which is usually the vesting period.
However, SFAS123 also allows entities to continue to measure
compensation costs for employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method of accounting prescribed by APB Opinion No25, Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees APB25. Because the Company has elected to continue to follow APB 25,
SFAS123 requires disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per
share as if the new fair value accounting method were adopted. 57 If
the Company had adopted the fair value accounting method under SFAS123,
the Companys net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the
pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands, except per share amounts

The fair value of these options was estimated using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with a risk-free interest rate of 60% for 2001 and
2002 and a range of 365% to 42% for 2003, volatility factors of 1891 for
2001, a range of 1792 to 1877 for 2002 and a range of 433 to 471 for 2003,
a dividend yield of 0%, and an expected option life from zero to seven years
for 2001, 2002 and 2003. Advertising Costs The Company charges advertising costs to expenses as incurred. Advertising and marketing expense related to
operations was $12 million for fiscal year 2001, $13 million for fiscal year
2002, and $14 million for fiscal year 2003. Advertising and marketing expense is included in selling, general
and administrative expense. 58 Statement of Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents generally consist of cash and other money
market instruments. The Company
considers any temporary investments that mature in three months or less when
purchased to be cash equivalents for reporting cash flows. Accounting Pronouncements In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS
143. SFAS 143 requires entities to
record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the
period in which it is incurred. The
statement requires that the amount recorded as a liability be capitalized by
increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Subsequent to initial measurement, the
liability is accreted to the ultimate amount anticipated to be paid and is also
adjusted for revisions to the timing or amount of estimated cash flows. The capitalized cost is depreciated over the
useful life of the related asset. Upon
settlement of the liability, an entity either settles the obligation for its
recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement. SFAS 143 became effective for financial
statements beginning January 1, 2003.
The application of the new accounting standard did not have a material
impact on the Companys financial statements. In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets SFAS 144. SFAS 144
supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and the accounting and
reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of
Operations-Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, and
establishes accounting standards for the impairment and disposal of long-lived
assets and criteria for determining when a long-lived asset is held for
sale. SFAS 144 removes the requirement
to allocate goodwill to long-lived assets to be tested for impairment, requires
that the depreciable life of a long-lived asset to be abandoned be revised in
accordance with APB Opinion No. 20, Accounting Changes, provides that one
accounting model be used for long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale,
whether previously held and used or newly acquired and broadens the
presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal
transactions. SFAS 144 became effective
for financial statements beginning January 1, 2002. The Company has complied
with the requirements of SFAS 144 in reporting its discontinued operations in
2002 see Note 3. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146,
Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities SFAS
146. SFAS 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be
recognized and measured initially at its fair market value in the period in
which the liability is incurred except for a liability for onetime termination
benefits that is incurred over time. The provisions of SFAS 146 became 59 effective for exit or disposal activities
initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted SFAS 146 and it did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 FIN 45,
Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for
most guarantees, including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with
operating lease agreements. It also
clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, we must recognize an
initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that
guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual
financial statements. The initial
recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective
for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15,
2002. The Company has adopted FIN 45 and it did not have a material impact on
our financial position or results of operations. In December 2002, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
Transition and Disclosure. SFAS 148
amends SFAS 123 to provide alternate methods of transition for an entity that
changes to the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS 148
amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS 123 to require expanded and more
prominent disclosure of the effects of an entitys accounting policy in the
summary of significant accounting policies section with respect to stock-based
employee compensation. The amendment of
the annual disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 is effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2002. The
Company has included the amended disclosure requirement of SFAS 148 in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and in December 2003 issued a
revised interpretation FIN 46R. FIN
46 and FIN 46R address the accounting for, and disclosure of, investments in
variable interest entities. The Company
has adopted FIN 46 and FIN 46R and they did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations. 60 In April 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 149 SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities. This statement
amends SFAS 133 to provide clarification on the financial accounting and
reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires
contracts with similar characteristics to be accounted for on a comparable
basis. The Company has adopted SFAS 149
for all contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and it did not
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. On May 15, 2003, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 150 SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. The statement established standards for classifying and measuring
as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the
issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS 150 must be applied immediately to
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003. The Company has
adopted SFAS 150 and has determined it will not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations. 3. DISCONTINUED
OPERATIONS On November 12, 2002, the Company announced that it would sell its
Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores as a result of continuing
deterioration in the Michigan construction equipment market and its location in
regards to the Companys other operations and its plans for future
expansion. The sale of the Michigan
construction equipment stores was substantially complete at December 31,
2002. Prior to the sale, Michigan
construction equipment stores were part of the Companys Construction Equipment
segment. The Construction Equipment
segment has been restated for all periods presented to exclude the Michigan
stores. On November 12, 2002 the Company decided to discontinue its Retail
segment, which operated three farm and ranch retail stores in Seguin, Hockley
and Denton, Texas. The Company decided
that the Retail segment did not fit into its long-term plans of growing its
core heavy-duty truck and construction equipment businesses. The Denton store was closed in December
2002, the Hockley store began liquidating inventory during November 2002 and
completed the liquidation on March 9, 2003.
The Company is actively marketing the Seguin store and expects to sell
the store by December 31, 2004. As a
result of these actions, the Retail segment will no longer be reported as a
separate business segment. As a result of these decisions the Company recognized nonrecurring and
unusual charges, net of income tax benefits, of $83 million $058 per diluted
share in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Following is a discussion that describes the components of the $83
million in charges based on their classification in the Companys consolidated
financial statements. 61 The $83 million in charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002
included charges, net of income tax benefits, of approximately $25 million
related to the Michigan John Deere construction equipment stores sold during
December 2002. The remaining $58
million in charges relate to closing, liquidation and pending sale of Retail
segment stores described above. These charges are included in discontinued
operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income in accordance
with SFAS 144. In addition, the results
of operations of these businesses have been classified as discontinued
operations in the Companys consolidated statements of income for all periods
presented. Similarly, certain assets of
these businesses have been separately identified in the consolidated balance
sheet as being held for sale. The
Company expects to complete the sale of these assets by December 31, 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense are no
longer being recorded with respect to the assets of these businesses in
accordance with SFAS 144. These assets
are recorded at estimated fair value less cost to sell at December 31, 2003. Changes in the estimated fair value will be
recorded in future periods as determined.

related to costs associated with infrastructure reduction, including
professional fees and facilities. No further charges related to the disposition
were incurred during 2003. Included in the $90 million DD charge for 2002 was a $51 million
loss for the sale of fixed assets, $15 million loss on the disposal of
inventory, $11 million expense for early termination benefits and a $10

4. SUPPLIER AND CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION Major Suppliers and Dealership Agreements The Company has entered into dealership agreements with various
companies Distributors. These
agreements are nonexclusive agreements that allow the Company to stock, sell at
retail and service trucks, equipment and products of the Distributors in the
Companys defined market. The
agreements allow the Company to use the Distributors name, trade symbols and
intellectual property and expire as follows 
Distributor
Expiration Dates
PACCAR
August 2004 to October 2006
John Deere
Indefinite
These agreements, as well as agreements with various other
Distributors, impose a number of restrictions and obligations on the Company,
including restrictions on a change in control of the Company and the
maintenance of certain required levels of working capital. Violation of these restrictions could result
in the loss of the Companys right to purchase the Distributors products and
use the Distributors trademarks. As of 63 December31, 2003, the Companys management believes it was in
compliance with all the restrictions and obligations of its dealership
agreements. The Company purchases most of its new vehicles and parts from PACCAR,
the maker of Peterbilt trucks and parts, at prevailing prices charged to all
franchised dealers. Sales of new
Peterbilt trucks accounted for 97%, 98% and 95% of the Companys new vehicle
sales for the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. The Company purchases most of its new construction equipment and parts
from John Deere at prevailing prices charged to all franchised dealers. Sales of new John Deere equipment accounted
for 85%, 91% and 93% of the Companys new equipment sales for the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. Primary Lenders The Company purchases its new and used truck and construction equipment
inventories with the assistance of floor plan financing programs offered by
various financial institutions and John Deere.
The financial institution used for truck inventory purchases also
provides the Company with a line of credit that allows borrowings of up to
$13,500,000 and with notes on certain real estate properties. The floor plan agreement with the financial
institution, used for truck inventory purchases, provides that such agreement
may be terminated at the option of the lender with notice of 120 days. The floor plan agreement with one of the financial institutions used
for construction equipment purchases expires in June 2004. Additionally, floor plan financing is
provided by John Deere pursuant to the Companys equipment dealership
agreement. Furthermore, the agreements
also provide that the occurrence of certain events will be considered events of
default. There were no known events of
default as of December 31, 2003. In the
event that the Companys financing becomes insufficient, or its relationship
with the current primary lenders terminates, the Company would need to obtain
similar financing from other sources.
Management believes it can obtain additional floor plan financing or
alternative financing if necessary. The Companys debt agreements include certain restrictive covenants
including maintaining a tangible net worth of at least $150 million and a debt
to tangible net worth ratio of 9 to 1.
The Company was in compliance with these and all debt covenants as of
December 31, 2003. Concentrations of Credit
Risks Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with what it considers
to be quality financial institutions.
At December31, 2003, the Company had deposits in excess of federal
insurance totaling approximately $393 million. 64 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are
reduced because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the
Companys customer base, thus spreading the trade credit risk. A majority of the Companys business,
however, is concentrated in the United States heavy-duty trucking and
construction equipment markets and related aftermarkets. The Company controls credit risk through
credit approvals and by selling certain trade receivables without
recourse. Related to the Companys
finance contracts, after the finance contract is entered into, the Company
generally sells the contracts to a third party. The finance contracts are sold both with and without
recourse. A majority of the Companys
finance contracts are sold without recourse.
Historically, bad debt expense associated with the Companys accounts
receivable and finance contracts has not been significant. 5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The Companys accounts receivable, net, consisted of the following in

Allowance for Doubtful Receivables The Company provides an allowance for uncollectible warranty
receivables. The Company evaluates the
collectibility of its warranty claims receivable based on a combination of
factors, including aging and correspondence with the applicable
manufacturer. Management reviews the
warranty claims receivable aging and adjusts the allowance based on historical
experience. The Company sells a
majority of its customer accounts receivable to a third party that is
responsible for qualifying the 66 customer for credit at the point of sale. As all credit risk is assumed by the third party, the Company
provides no allowance for customer accounts receivable. Inventory The Company provides a reserve for obsolete and slow moving parts. The reserve is reviewed and, if necessary,
adjustments are made on a quarterly basis.
The Company relies on historical information to support its
reserve. Once the inventory is written
down, the Company does not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is
sold. The valuation for new and used truck inventory is based on specific
identification. A detail of new and
used truck inventory is reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments to the value of
specific units are made on a quarterly basis. 8. FLOOR PLAN NOTES PAYABLE AND LINES OF CREDIT Floor Plan Notes Payable Floor plan notes are financing agreements to
facilitate the Companys purchase of new and used trucks and construction
equipment. These notes are
collateralized by the inventory purchased and accounts receivable arising from
the sale thereof. The Companys floor
plan notes have interest rates based on the Prime rate or LIBOR, as defined in
the agreements. The interest rates
applicable to these agreements ranged from approximately 335% to approximately
550% as of December 31, 2003. The
amounts borrowed under these agreements are due when the related truck or
construction equipment inventory collateral is sold and the sales proceeds
are collected by the Company, or in the case of construction equipment rentals,
when the carrying value of the equipment is reduced. These lines may be modified, suspended or terminated by the
lender as described in Note 4. The Companys floor plan agreement with its
primary truck lender limits the borrowing capacity based on the number of new
and used trucks that may be financed.
As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate amount of unit capacity for new
and used trucks was 1,390 and 553, respectively, and the availability for new
and used trucks was 130 and 238, respectively. The Companys floor plan agreement with one
of its construction equipment lenders is based on the book value of the
Companys construction equipment inventory.
As of December31, 2003, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity
with this lender was $105 million, with approximately $45million
outstanding. Additional amounts are
available under the Companys John Deere dealership agreement. At December31, 2003, approximately
$15million was outstanding pursuant to the John Deere dealership
agreement. 67 Amounts

Lines of Credit The Company has a
separate line of credit agreement with a financial institution that provides
for an aggregate maximum borrowing of $135 million, with advances generally
limited to 75% of the Companys new parts inventory. Advances bear interest at prime less 05%, which was 35% on
December 31, 2003. Advances under the
line-of-credit agreement are secured by new parts inventory. The line of credit agreement contains
financial covenants. The Company was in
compliance with these covenants on December31, 2003. Either party may terminate the agreement
with 30days written notice. As of
December31, 2002 and 2003, advances outstanding under this line-of-credit
agreement amounted to $135 million. As
of December31, 2003, there were no funds available for future
borrowings. This line is discretionary
and may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of the lender. The
Company has four additional separate secured lines of credit that provide for
an aggregate maximum borrowing of $136 million. Advances outstanding under these secured lines of credit in
aggregate were $42 million, leaving $94 million available for future
borrowings as of December 31, 2003. 68 9. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt was comprised of the following in thousands

The interest rates on the Companys variable
interest rate notes are based on LIBOR and the Prime rate on December31,
2003. Interest rates on the notes
ranged from approximately 337% to 422% on December 31, 2003. Payments on the
notes range from $1,945 to $67,000 per month, plus interest. Maturities of these notes range from April
2004 to September 2014. The Companys fixed interest rate notes are
primarily with financial institutions and had interest rates ranging from
approximately 386% to 1079% on December31, 2003. Payments on the notes range from $220 to $34,833
per month, plus interest. Maturities of
these notes range from January 2004 to January 2016. The proceeds from the issuance of the notes
were used primarily to acquire land, buildings and improvements, transportation
equipment and leasing vehicles. The
notes are secured by the assets acquired with the proceeds of such notes. 10. DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument held by
the Company 69 Current assets and current liabilities The carrying value approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these
items. Long-term debt -
The fair value of the Companys long-term debt is based on secondary market
indicators. Since the Companys debt is
not quoted, estimates are based on each obligations characteristics, including
remaining maturities, interest rate, credit rating, collateral, amortization
schedule and liquidity. The carrying
amount approximates fair value. 11. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN The Company has a defined contribution plan
the Rush Plan, which is available to all Company employees and the
employees of certain affiliates. Each
employee who has completed six months of continuous service is entitled to
enter the Rush Plan. Participating
employees may contribute from 1% to 50% of total gross compensation. However, certain higher paid employees are
limited to a maximum contribution of 15% of total gross compensation. For the first 10% of an employees
contribution, the Company, at its discretion, may contribute an amount equal to
25% of the employees contributions for those employees with less than five
years of service and an amount equal to 50% of the employees contributions for
those employees with more than five years of service. During the year ended December31, 2001, the Company
incurred expenses of approximately $16 million related to the Rush Plan. During the year ended December31,
2002, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $15 million related to
the Rush Plan. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company incurred expenses of approximately $16 million
related to the Rush Plan. The Company currently does not provide any
postretirement benefits nor does it provide any postemployment benefits. 70 12. LEASES Vehicle Leases The Company leases vehicles primarily over periods ranging from one to
ten years under operating lease arrangements.
These vehicles are subleased to customers under various agreements in
its own leasing operation. Generally,
the Company is required to incur all operating costs and pay a minimum rental
and an excess mileage charge based on maximum mileage over the term of the
lease. Vehicle lease expenses for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, were approximately $54
million, $50 million and $53 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments for noncancelable vehicle leases in effect

under the Companys Incentive Plan. On April8, 1996, the Board of Directors
of the Company declared a dividend of one common share purchase right a
Right for each share of common stock outstanding. Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
Company one share of Class A Common Stock and one share of Class B Common Stock
at a price of $1750 per share the Purchase Price. The Rights are not
exercisable until the distribution date, as defined in the Rights
Agreement. The Rights will expire on
April7, 2006 the Final Expiration Date, unless the Final Expiration
Date is extended or unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by the
Company. In March 2001 and 2002, the Company granted
options under the Incentive Plan to purchase an aggregate of 212,200 and
250,000 shares, respectively, of the Old Common Stock to employees. Each option
granted becomes exercisable in three annual installments beginning on the third
anniversary of the grant date. The
options are exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the Companys Old
Common Stock at the grant date.
However, each option has now been divided into two options, one option
for 72 the purchase of Class A Common Stock and one
option for the purchase of Class B Common Stock. Each of the options is exercisable at one-half of the fair value
of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. In March 2003, the Company granted options
under the Incentive Plan to purchase an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock and 93,000 shares of Class B Common Stock. Each option granted becomes exercisable in three
annual installments beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date. During 2000, the Company granted options
outside of any plan to purchase an aggregate of 169,258 shares of Old Common
Stock to employees. A total of 69,258
of these options were terminated in 2001 and 2002. The remaining 100,000
options were divided into two options, one for Class A Common Stock and one for
Class B Common Stock, and are exercisable at a price equal to one-half of the
fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock at the grant date. These options are exercisable four years
from the grant date. During 1997, the Board of Directors and
shareholders adopted the Rush Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Non-Employee Director
Stock Option Plan the Director Plan.
The Director Plan is designed to attract and retain highly qualified
non-employee directors, reserving 300,000 shares of Old Common Stock for
issuance upon exercise of any awards granted under the Plan. Under the terms of the Director Plan, each
non-employee director received options to purchase 10,000 shares of the Old
Common Stock as of the date of adoption or on their respective date of
election, all of which are fully vested and are exercisable immediately, and
expire ten years from the grant date.
During the year ended December31, 2002, 30,000 options were
granted and were exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the
Companys Old Common Stock on the grant date. However, each option has now been
divided into two options, one option for the purchase of Class A Common Stock
and one option for the purchase of Class B Common Stock. Each of the options is exercisable at
one-half of the fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock on the grant
date. During the year ended December
31, 2003, 60,000 options of Class A Common Stock were granted under the terms
of the Director Plan. During 2001, the Company granted options
outside any plan to purchase an aggregate of 60,000 shares of Old Common Stock
to non-employee directors, all of which are fully vested and were exercisable
immediately, and expire ten years from the grant date. The options were
exercisable at a price equal to the fair value of the Companys Old Common
Stock on the grant date. However, each
option has now been divided into two options; one option for the purchase of
Class A Common Stock and one option for the purchase of Class B Common
Stock. Each of the options is
exercisable at one-half of the fair value of the Companys Old Common Stock on
the grant date. 73 A summary of the Companys stock option activity and related information

In October 1997, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate
of 171,875 shares of the Old Common Stock to C. Jim Stewart Stevenson in
connection with the purchase of the assets of the John Deere construction
equipment store. The warrants were
exercisable during the five-year period commencing October6, 1997, at an
exercise price equal to $600 per share.
These warrants expired without being exercised during 2002. 74 In March 1998 and 2000, the Company issued, to certain employees, warrants
to purchase an aggregate of 1875% of the common stock of Rush Retail Centers,
Inc., its wholly owned subsidiary, for $375,000. The warrants were exercisable on various dates between March 2001
and March 2003 and expire ten years from the grant date. None of these warrants were exercised as of
December 31, 2003. 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share for all periods have been restated to reflect the
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per
Share SFAS 128, which established standards for computing and presenting
earnings per share EPS for entities with publicly held common stock or
potential common stock. This statement
requires dual presentation of basic and diluted EPS on the face of the income statement
for all entities with complex capital structures. Basic EPS were computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS differs from basic EPS due to
the assumed conversions of potentially dilutive options and warrants that were
outstanding during the period. The
following is a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the
basic and diluted per share computations for net income.

16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is contingently liable to finance
companies for certain notes initiated on behalf of such finance companies
related to the sale of trucks and construction equipment. The majority of finance contracts are sold
without recourse to the Company. The
Companys liability related to finance contracts sold with recourse is
generally limited to 5% to 20% of the outstanding amount of each note initiated
on the behalf of the finance company.
The Company provides an allowance for repossession losses and early
repayment penalties. Finance contracts initiated and sold during
the years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003, were $1499 million 1441 million and $1651 million, respectively. The Company is involved in various claims and
legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes it is unlikely that the
final outcome of any of the claims or proceedings to which the Company is a
party would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position
or results of operations; however, due to the inherent uncertainty of
litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular
claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the Companys
results of operations for the fiscal period in which such resolution occurred. 77 17. ACQUISITIONS In August 2001, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of El
Paso Trucks, which consisted of two dealership locations in El Paso, Texas and
Las Cruces, New Mexico. The transaction was valued at $25million with
the purchase price paid in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase; operations of the business acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective date of
acquisition. The purchase price has
been allocated based on the fair values of the assets at the date of
acquisition as follows inthousands

In November 2001, the Company purchased substantially all the assets of
Perfection, which operates an oil and gas up-fitting business, a medium-duty
truck accessory and up-fitting business and a parts distribution business in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The assets acquired were valued at $67million
with a purchase price of $42 million paid in cash. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase; operations of the business acquired have been included in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements from the respective date of
acquisition. The purchase price was
less than the fair value of the assets acquired. The purchase price has been allocated by reducing the property
and equipment with a fair value of $19 million to $0, and inventory with a
fair value of $31 million to $25 million, and recording accounts receivable,
net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, at its fair value of $17 million. In February 2003, the Company acquired the
common stock of Orange County, a Peterbilt dealer in central Florida. The acquisition provides the Company with
the exclusive rights to sell Peterbilt trucks and parts from three new
locations in central Florida, including Orlando, Haines City and Tampa. The transaction was valued at approximately
$54 million, with the purchase price paid in cash. The Orange County acquisition has been
accounted for as a purchase; operations of the business acquired have been

Since the Orange County acquisition was a

substantially all of the assets of Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc., which consisted
of a dealership location in Mobile, Alabama.
Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc.s primary line of business is the sale of new
Peterbilt and used heavy-duty trucks, parts and service. The Peterbilt of Mobile, Inc. acquisition has
been accounted for as a purchase; operations of the business acquired have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the

Accounting Standards No131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information SFAS131.
This statement requires that public business enterprises report certain
information about operating segments in complete sets of financial statements
of the enterprise and in condensed financial statements of interim periods
issued to shareholders. It also
requires that public business enterprises report certain information about
their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and
their major customers. As mentioned previously, the Company announced in November 2002 its
decision to sell its John Deere construction equipment stores in Michigan, and
discontinue its DD operations. In
connection with this decision, financial information related to the Companys
construction equipment operations in Michigan will not be included in the
Construction Equipment segment below, and the Retail Segment will no longer be
presented as a separate operating segment.
Following is a brief description of the activities of each of the
Companys business segments. The Company has two reportable segments: the Heavy-Duty Truck segment and the Construction Equipment
segment. The Heavy-Duty Truck segment operates a regional network of truck
centers that provide an integrated one-stop source for the trucking needs of
its customers, including retail sales of new Peterbilt and used heavy-duty
trucks, aftermarket parts, service and body shop facilities, and a wide array
of financial services, including the financing of new and used truck purchases,
insurance products and truck leasing and rentals. The Construction Equipment
segment operates a full-service John Deere dealership that serves the Houston,
Texas metropolitan and surrounding areas.
Dealership operations include the retail sale of new and used equipment,
aftermarket parts and service facilities, equipment rentals, and the financing
of new and used equipment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on income before income
taxes not including extraordinary items. The Company accounts for
intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third
parties, that is, at current market prices.
There were no material intersegment sales during the years ended
December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003. 81 The Companys reportable segments are strategic business units that
offer different products and services.
They are managed separately because each business unit requires
different technology and marketing strategies.
Business units were maintained through expansion and acquisitions. Assets held for sale and goodwill related to
discontinued operations are included in the Heavy-Duty Truck segment. The following table contains summarized
information about reportable segment profit or loss and segment assets for the
years ended December31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 in thousands

attributable to three operating segments of the Company. Those segments include a tire company, an
insurance company, and a hunting lease operation. None of those segments has ever met any of the quantitative
thresholds for determining reportable segments. 83
