DATA  A.Description of Business
Mercury Computer Systems, Inc. the Company
or Mercury designs, manufactures and markets high-performance, real-time digital signal and image processing computer systems that transform sensor-generated data into information that can be displayed as images for human interpretation
or subjected to additional computer analysis. These multicomputer systems are heterogeneous and scalable, allowing them to accommodate several different microprocessor types and to scale from a few to hundreds of microprocessors within a single
system. The primary markets for the Companys products are defense electronics, medical imaging, and other Original Equipment Manufacturers OEM solutions. These markets have computing needs that benefit from the unique system
architecture developed by the Company.  B.Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  USE OF
ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  Revenue from system sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title
and risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is fixed or determinable, collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured, and customer acceptance criteria, if any, have been
successfully demonstrated.  Certain contracts with customers
require the Company to perform tests of its products prior to shipment to ensure their performance complies with the Companys published product specifications and, on occasion, with additional customer-requested specifications. In these cases,
the Company conducts such tests and, if they are completed successfully, includes a written confirmation with each order shipped. As a result, at the time of each product shipment, the Company believes that no further customer testing requirements
exist and that there is no uncertainty of non-acceptance by its customer. In the rare instance that customer payment is conditioned upon final acceptance testing by the customer at its own facility, the Company does not recognize any revenue until
the final acceptance testing has been completed and written confirmation from the customer has been received.  The Company does not provide its customers with rights of product return, other than those related to warranty provisions that permit repair or
replacement of defective goods. The Company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon product shipment.  Installation of the Companys products requires insignificant effort that does not alter the capabilities of the Companys products and may be
performed by its customers or other vendors. If an order includes installation or 
40  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
training services that are undelivered at the time of product shipment, the Company defers revenue equal to the fair value of the installation or training
obligations until such time as the services have been provided. The Company determines these fair values based on the price typically charged to its customers who purchase these services separately.  In limited circumstances, the Company engages in long-term contracts to
design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. For these contracts, the Company recognizes revenue using the percentage-of-completion method of contract accounting, measuring progress towards completion based on contract cost incurred to
date as compared with total estimated contract costs. The use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract costs, including assumptions relative to the length of time to
complete the contract, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, anticipated increases in wages and prices for subcontractor services and materials, and the availability of subcontractor services and materials. The Companys
estimates are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of its engineers, program managers and other personnel, who review each long-term contract monthly to assess the contracts schedule, performance, technical matters and
estimated cost at completion. When adjustments in estimated contract costs are determined, such revisions may have the effect of adjusting in the current period the earnings applicable to performance in prior periods. Anticipated losses, if any, are
recognized in the period in which determined.  For transactions
involving the licensing of standalone software products and of software that is not incidental to the product, the Company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the software has occurred, the price is
fixed or determinable, and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The Companys standalone software products are not deemed essential to the functionality of any hardware system and do not require installation by the
Company or significant modification or customization of the software. The fair value of maintenance agreements related to standalone software products is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement.  DEFERRED REVENUES
AND CUSTOMER ADVANCES  Deferred revenues and customer advances include amounts billed and collected on uncompleted contracts and amounts billed on annual maintenance contracts.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  Cash equivalents, consisting of money market funds and U.S. government and
U.S. government agency issues with original maturities of 90 days or less, are carried at fair market value.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  The Company classifies investments in marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and periodically
re-evaluates such classification. There were no securities classified as trading or held-to-maturity as of June 30, 2003 and 2002. Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair market value. Unrealized gains or losses on
available-for-sale securities are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income until disposition of the security. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available-for-sale securities
are included in other income or expense. For determinations of gain or loss, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.  The fair market value of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities represents the quoted market prices at the
balance sheet dates. Debt securities with original maturities greater 
41  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
than 90 days and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short-term marketable securities. Debt securities that have remaining maturities
greater than one year are classified as long-term marketable securities.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, marketable securities and accounts
receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions which management believes are of high credit quality. At June 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had approximately $6,737 and $6,191, respectively, on deposit or
invested with its primary financial and lending institution. There are no significant concentrations of investments in corporate debt securities with any single issuer of debt securities.  The Company provides credit to customers in the normal course of business. Collateral is not required for accounts
receivable, but ongoing credit evaluations of a customers financial condition are performed. At June30, 2003, three customers accounted for 27%, 21% and 15% of the Companys receivables, respectively. AtJune 30, 2002, three
different customers accounted for 18%, 17% and 11% of the Companys receivables, respectively.  INVENTORY  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out FIFO basis, or market value.  GOODWILL AND
ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Acquired intangible assets result from the Companys acquisition of Myriad Logic, Inc. see Note G and consist of identifiable intangible assets, including completed technology and a licensing agreement.
Acquired intangible assets are reported at cost, net of accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of four years. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a
business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is not amortized in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill is assessed
for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. If the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair
value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess.  LONG-LIVED
ASSETS  Long-lived assets primarily include
property and equipment and acquired intangible assets. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of
these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value
based on a discounted cash flow analysis.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  The Companys financial instruments include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, employee life insurance policies, capital lease obligations and
notes payable. The carrying amount of cash equivalents, 
42  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
accounts receivable and capital lease obligations approximate their fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying amount of Company-owned life
insurance policies approximates fair value. Also, based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for notes payable, the carrying value of notes payable approximates fair value.  PROPERTY AND
EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment are recorded
at cost. Equipment under capital lease is recorded at the present value of the minimum lease payments required during the lease period. Depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method:
Computer equipment
3years
Machinery and equipment
5 years
Furniture and fixtures
5 years
Buildings
1530years
Building improvements
10 years
Expenditures for
additions, renewals and betterment of property and equipment are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. As assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations.  CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  The Company capitalizes software development costs incurred after a
products technological feasibility has been established and before it is available for general release to customers. Amortization of capitalized software costs commences once the product is available for general release and is computed on an
individual product basis based on the greater of a the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to total anticipated gross revenues for that product, or b the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product.
Software development costs qualifying for capitalization were not material for the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  ADVERTISING COSTS 
The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. During the years
ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, advertising expenses totaled $210, $313 and $367, respectively, and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. 
43  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY 
The Companys product sales include a one-year hardware warranty. At
time of product shipment, the Company accrues for the estimated cost to repair or replace potentially defective products. Estimated warranty costs are based upon prior actual warranty costs for substantially similar transactions. The following table
presents the changes in the Companys product warranty liability for the year ended June 30, 2003:  Balance at June 30, 2002 835 Accruals for warranties issued during the year 1,625 Settlements made during the year 1,535 Balance at June 30, 2003 925  INCOME TAXES  The
Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Companys consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance
against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  NET INCOME PER SHARE  Basic net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus additional common shares that would
have been outstanding if potential dilutive common shares had been issued for granted stock options.  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  The Company has several stock-based employee compensation plans. The Company
accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by Accounting Principles Board APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and related interpretations.
Accordingly, no compensation expense is recorded for options issued to employees in fixed amounts with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair market value of the Companys common stock at the date of grant. The Company has adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, as amended by SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, through disclosure only. All stock-based awards to
non-employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 123.

The weighted average
grant-date fair values for options granted during the twelve months ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $1409, $2375 and $2449, respectively, per option. The fair value of options at date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:  Years Ended June 30 2003 2002 2001 Option life
6years 6years 6years Risk-free interest rate
437 468 497 Stock volatility
81 81 80 Dividend rate
0 0 0  The weighted-average
fair value of purchase rights granted in fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan were $912, $1674 and $1352, respectively. The fair value of the employees purchase rights was estimated using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 00%; an expected life of six months; expected volatility of 79% for fiscal 2003, 81% for fiscal 2002 and 80% for fiscal 2001; and risk-free interest rates of 107%
for fiscal 2003, 175% for fiscal 2002, and 363% for fiscal 2001.  During the year ended June 30, 2003, the stock option agreements of certain employees were modified to provide accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods, which resulted in the recognition of $47 of stock-based compensation expense
in that period. During the year ended June 30, 2002, the stock option agreements of certain employees were modified to provide accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods, which resulted in the recognition of $1,073 of stock-based compensation
expense in that period. In addition, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $864, $79 and $411 during the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for stock options granted to non-employees. Such amounts reflect the
fair value of options upon their final vesting dates as well as adjustments for the revaluation of a portion of the unvested options at each period-end. The fair value of these non-employee stock option grants was calculated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss, which includes foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities. 
45  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
For purposes of comprehensive income disclosures, the Company does not record tax provisions or benefits for the net changes in the foreign currency
translation adjustment, as the Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. Items included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income at June 30, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:  June30,2003
June30,2002
Foreign Currency Translation 220 22
Unrealized Gain loss on securities 94 258 314 280  FOREIGN CURRENCY  Euros
are used as the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in France and the Netherlands, while local currency is used as the functional currency for the Companys subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Japan. The accounts of
foreign subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at period-end for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations. The related translation adjustments are reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. Gains losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense and are immaterial for all periods presented.  RECLASSIFICATIONS  Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior years financial
statements to conform to the current years presentation.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure SFAS 148.
SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation as originally provided by SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. In
addition, SFAS 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123 to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based compensation and the effect of the method used on
reported results. The transitional requirements of SFAS 148 are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for financial reports containing condensed financial
statements for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted the disclosure requirements in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. As the Company did not make a voluntary change to the fair value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee awards, the adoption of SFAS 148 did not have any impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 149 SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS 149 amends and clarifies accounting and reporting of derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities under SFAS 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The Company does not expect that the
adoption of SFAS 149 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 
46  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150 SFAS
150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability. For all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, SFAS 150 is effective immediately. For all
other instruments, SFAS 150 goes into effect at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 150 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.  In November 2002, the FASB issued Emerging Issues
Task Force 00-21 EITF 00-21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. EITF 00-21 requires revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to be divided into separate units of accounting. If the deliverables in the
arrangement meet certain criteria, arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values. Applicable revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units
of accounting. The guidance in EITF 00-21 is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect that the adoption of EITF 00-21 will have a material impact on its financial
position or results of operations.  In January 2003, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by a business of variable interest entities in which it is the primary beneficiary. The Interpretation was
effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003; for variable interest entities created before February 1, 2003, the Interpretation is effective for periods beginning after June
15, 2003. The Company does not expect that the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

G.Acquisition  On April 1, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of Myriad Logic, Inc. Myriad. Myriad is a developer of I/O technology based in
Silver Spring, Maryland. The acquisition of Myriad expanded Mercurys capability to provide more of a total system solution and additional system integration services. The total purchase price of $7,948 consisted of $7,500 in cash plus $448 of
transaction costs directly related to the acquisition. Myriads operating results are included in the consolidated statement of operations from April 1, 2002.  The purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as follows:
Accounts receivable 1,260 Inventory 806 Other assets 290 Completed technology 3,100 Licensing agreement 300 Goodwill 4,225 Current liabilities 775 Deferred tax liabilities 1,258 7,948  The amortization

Estimated future amortization expense for acquired intangible assets remaining at June 30, 2003 is $850 for fiscal 2004 850 for fiscal 2005, and $639 for fiscal 2006.  Goodwill of
$4,225 recorded as of June 30, 2003 is allocated entirely to the Defense Electronics reporting unit. There has been no change to the amount of goodwill during the year ended June 30, 2003. In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company performed an annual
assessment for impairment of its goodwill in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 by applying a fair-value based test and concluded that no impairment existed.  I.Commitments and Contingencies  LEGAL CLAIMS  In July 1999, a former employee alleged a wrongful termination action against the Company and certain officers of the Company. The former employee sought
severance pay, the right to purchase 60,000 shares of the Companys common stock at a price of $200 per share, the right to exercise stock options to purchase 96,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $200 per share, reimbursement
of relocation costs and bonus compensation. The Company and the former employee entered into binding arbitration in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, in December 2002, an award was entered in favor of the employee on one count, and for the
50  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
Company and certain officers of the Company on the remainder of the counts. As a result of the award, the Company recorded an expense in the second quarter
of fiscal 2003 of approximately $800,000, which was included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In January 2003, all obligations under the award were settled.  The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does
not believe these actions will have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of its operations.  PURCHASE COMMITMENTS  As of June 30, 2003, the Company has entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain components used in its
normal operations. The purchase commitments covered by these agreements are for less than one year and aggregate approximately $60 million.  LEASE COMMITMENTS 
The Company leases certain facilities, machinery and equipment under operating leases expiring in various years through 2007. The leases contain
various renewal options. Rental charges are subject to escalation for increases in certain operating costs of the lessor. Rental expense during the years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $930, $834 and $475, respectively. Minimum lease
payments under these operating leases are as follows:  YearEndingJune30 2003 867
2004 830
2005 576
2006 445
2007 98 Total minimum lease payments 2,816  GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS  In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that include provisions requiring the Company to indemnify, hold harmless and
reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally the Companys customers, in connection with any patent, or any other intellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to
the Companys products. These indemnification obligations generally run until the applicable statute of limitations lapses. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification
obligations, in certain cases, is unlimited. The Company has never incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification obligations. As a result, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these obligations is
minimal. Accordingly, the Company has recognized no liabilities for these obligations as of June 30, 2003.  To the extent permitted by Massachusetts law, the Companys by-laws, as amended, require the Company to indemnify any current or former director,
officer or employee of the Company appointed or elected by the board of directors or stockholders of the Company, or who has served or is serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, trustee, principal, partner, employee or other
agent of any other organization, against all expenses incurred by such person in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of 
51  MERCURY COMPUTER SYSTEMS, INC.  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSContinued 
his or her serving or having served in such capacity. Because no claim for indemnification has been made by any person covered by the relevant provisions of
the Companys by-laws, the Company believes that its estimated exposure for these indemnification obligations is currently minimal. Accordingly, the Company has recognized no liabilities for these obligations as of June 30, 2003.  J.Notes Payable  Notes payable consisted of the following:  June 30 2003

In January 2003, the Company announced a reorganization of its business units. As of January 2003, the Wireless Communications group no longer existed as a stand-alone business unit
and its resources and personnel were allocated to the Defense Electronics and OEM Solutions groups. The Company began reporting its operating segment results pursuant to this new structure in the quarter ended March 31, 2003. Segment information for
prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  Foreign revenue and long-lived assets represent less than 10% of the Companys total revenue and total long-lived assets as of or for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Foreign
revenue is based on the country in which the Companys legal subsidiary is domiciled.  Customers comprising 10% or more of the Companys revenues for the periods shown below are as follows:  YearsEndedJune30 2003 2002 2001 Customer A

interest. The quarterly payments were contingent upon IBMs continued use of the technology. If IBM defaulted, Mercury had the right to recover the
assets, including a patent and other intellectual property. The Company recorded contingent payments as gains when received. The Company recognized gains of $5,800, $6,400 and $6,400 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company received the final payments due from IBM for the sale of the SSBU in March 2003.  On February 8, 2002, the Company sold its entire interest in the AgileVision joint venture to Leitch Technology Corporation. The Company received no
proceeds and recorded a $78 gain related to the sale of the joint venture interest during the quarter ended March 31, 2002.  P.Equity Loss in Joint Venture  On September 1, 1999, the Company formed AgileVision LLC, a joint venture with the Sarnoff Corporation. The intent of the venture was to use
Mercurys technology in the design, development and delivery of products and solutions expected to reduce the cost of digital TV infrastructure for the broadcast and cable markets. During the years ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, the Company
recognized losses of $1,752 and $3,310, respectively, related to the operations of AgileVision. On February 8, 2002, the Company sold its entire interest in the AgileVision joint venture to Leitch Technology Corporation.  Summarized income statement results for AgileVision LLC were as follows:

Q.Related
Party Transactions  In 1996, the Company entered into a
contract with NDC Development Associates, Inc. Northland to perform design, development, permitting and management activities related to the construction of new corporate facilities. An officer and principal of Northland is an
immediate family member of the Companys chief executive officer. In January 2003, to assist with the design, permitting activities and oversight of the construction of a new facility, the Company entered into another agreement with Northland.
This current arrangement was subject to a competitive pricing analysis and review by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to ensure that the terms of the arrangements were fair and no less favorable to the Company than could be obtained

The Company has arrangements with other parties that do not meet the technical disclosure
requirements of related parties and are not material in the aggregate. These individual arrangements either fall under reporting thresholds or are with non-immediate family members of executive officers of the Company. The Company believes that the
