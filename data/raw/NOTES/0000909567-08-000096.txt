ITEM 8FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Consolidated Balance Sheets as at December31, 2007, and 2006 and the Consolidated Statements
of Income, Shareholders Equity and Cash Flow for the years ended December31, 2007, 2006, and
2005, are reported on by KPMG LLP, Chartered Accountants. These statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States and in Canada. A
reconciliation of the differences between United States and Canadian GAAP is included on Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements. MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company are the responsibility of management and
have been prepared in accordance with Unites States GAAP with a reconciliation to Canadian GAAP
and, where appropriate, reflect estimates based on managements judgement. In addition, all other
information contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K is also the responsibility of management. The Company maintains systems of internal accounting and administrative controls designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the financial information provided is accurate and complete and
that all assets are properly safeguarded. The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfills its responsibility
for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the Consolidated
Financial Statements. The Board appoints the Audit Committee, comprised of non-management
directors, which meets with management and KPMG LLP, the external auditors, at least once a year to
review, among other things, accounting policies, annual financial statements, the result of the
external audit examination, and the management discussion and analysis included in the Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The Audit Committee reports its finding to the Board of Directors so that the
Board may properly approve the financial statements. Additional commentary on corporate governance
appears in the Companys proxy statement for the 2008 Annual and Special Meeting of its
Shareholders and the information therein is incorporated herein by reference. 27 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Vitran Corporation Inc. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vitran Corporation Inc. the
Company as of December31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December31, 2007. Our audit also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index
under PartIV, a2. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Vitran Corporation Inc. as of December31, 2007 and
2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles vary in certain significant respects from Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles. Information relating to the nature and effect of such
differences is prescribed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January1, 2007, Vitran
Corporation Inc. changed its method of accounting for income tax uncertainties in accordance with
guidance provided in FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an
Interpretation of FASB Statement 109 and on January1, 2006, Vitran Corporation Inc. changed its
method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with guidance provided in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No123R, Share-Based Payments. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board United States, Vitran Corporation Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO and our report
dated February7, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. Chartered Accountants, Licensed Public Accountants s/ KPMG LLP Toronto, Canada

Description of the business   
Vitran Corporation Inc. Vitran or the Company is a North American provider of
freight services and distribution solutions to a wide variety of companies and
industries. Vitran offers less-than-truckload LTL service throughout Canada and the
United States. Vitran Logistics offers supply chain solutions in Canada and the United
States, including warehousing, inventory management and flow-through distribution
facilities, as well as freight brokerage services. Vitran also provides same-day and
next-day truckload services in the United States.   
b
Basis of presentation   
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated on consolidation.   
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United
States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP with a reconciliation to
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles in note 18. The Ontario Business
Corporations Act OBCA regulations allow issuers that are required to file reports
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States to file financial
statements under United States GAAP to meet their continuous disclosure obligations in
Canada. Prior to 2006, Vitran prepared its consolidated financial statements in
accordance with Canadian GAAP with a reconciliation to United States GAAP. Commencing
the first quarter of 2008, the reconciliation to Canadian GAAP will no longer be
required.   
All amounts in these consolidated financial statements are expressed in United States
dollars, unless otherwise stated.

New accounting pronouncements   
FSP FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No48, amends FASB
Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Tax, to provide guidance on
how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the
purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. The FSP is to be adopted
upon initial adoption of FIN 48 with retroactive treatment if required. The Company
adopted FIN 48 January1, 2007, consistent with the provisions of the FSP, with no cumulative
effect adjustment recorded at adoption. 33 Notes to Consolidated Financial

New accounting pronouncements continued   
SFAS Statement 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Including an amendment of SFAS Statement 115, permits entities to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on
a contract-by-contract basis. SFAS Statement 159 will be adopted January1, 2008, as
required by the statement. The requirements of SFAS Statement 159 are not expected to
have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   
SFAS Statement 157, Fair Value Measurements, defines fair values, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and requires enhanced disclosures about fair
value measurements. This statement applies when other accounting pronouncements require
or permit fair value measurements. SFAS Statement 157 will be adopted January1, 2008
as required by the statement.   
EITF 06-11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment
Awards, requires that the tax benefit received on dividends associated with share-based
awards that are charged to retained earnings should be recorded in additional paid-in
capital and included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential
future tax deficiencies on share-based payment awards. EITF 06-11 will be adopted
January1, 2008 as required by the guidance. The requirement of EITF 06-11 will not
have an effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   
d
Foreign currency translation   
A majority of the Companys shareholders, customers and industry analysts are located in
the United States. Accordingly, the Company has adopted the United States dollar as its
reporting currency.   
The United States dollar is the functional currency of the Companys operations in the
United States. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of the Companys Canadian
operations.   
Each operation translates foreign currency-denominated transactions into its functional
currency using the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction.   
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into
the functional currency of the operation using the year-end rate of exchange giving rise
to a gain or loss that is recognized in income during the current period. 34 Notes to Consolidated Financial

d
Foreign currency translation continued   
For reporting purposes, the Canadian operations are translated into United States
dollars using the current rate method. Under this method, all assets and liabilities
are translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are
translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. The resulting translation
adjustment is recorded as a separate component of shareholders equity. United States
dollar debt of $722million 2006 $852million is designated as a hedge of the
investment in the United States dollar functional operation, such that related
transaction gains and losses are recorded in the separate component of shareholders
equity.   
In respect of other transactions denominated in currencies other than the Canadian
dollar, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at the
year-end rates. Revenue and expenses are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on
the transaction dates. All of the exchange gains or losses resulting from these other
transactions are recognized in income.   
e
Revenue recognition   
The Companys LTL and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations
recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as
incurred. Revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management services
are provided.   
f
Accounts receivable   
Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $25million
at December31, 2007 2006 $22million.   
g
Cash and cash equivalents   
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on account and short-term investments with
maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are stated at cost, which
approximates market value.

Inventory   
Inventory consists of tires and spare parts and is valued at the lower of average cost
and replacement cost. 35 Notes to Consolidated Financial

Property and equipment   
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is
provided on a straight-line basis from the date assets are put in service over their
estimated useful lives as follows   
Buildings
30315 years   Leasehold interests and improvements
Over term of lease   Vehicles:
Trailers and containers
12 years   Trucks
8 years   Machinery and equipment
510 years     
Tires purchased as part of a vehicle are capitalized as a cost to the vehicle.
Replacement tires are expensed when placed in service.   
j
Goodwill and intangible assets   
As at September30, 2007, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test and
concluded there was no impairment. The change in goodwill is attributable to
translating the Canadian dollar-denominated goodwill to the United States dollar
reporting currency and to the acquisition of a subsidiary and acquisition of a business
note 2.   
Intangible assets consist of not-to-compete covenants and customer relationships and are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected lives ranging from three to eight
years.   
k
Income taxes   
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will
be realized in full or in part. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year
that includes the date of enactment. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No48,

Income taxes continued   
in Income Taxes, on January1, 2007 as described in note 8. FIN 48 requires that
uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two-step process, whereby ithe Company
determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained
based on the technical merits of the position and iifor those tax positions that meet
the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company would recognize the largest
amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.   
l
Share-based compensation   
Under the Companys stock option plan, options to purchase common shares of the Company
may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of the Company by the Board of
Directors or by the Companys Compensation Committee. There are 820,200 options
outstanding under the plan. The term of each option is 10years and the vesting period
is five years. The exercise price for options is the trading price of the common shares
of the Company on The Toronto Stock Exchange on the day of the grant.   
For all stock option grants prior to January1, 2003, share-based compensation to
employees was accounted for based on the intrinsic value method under APB No25 and
related interpretations. On January1, 2003, in accordance with a transitional option
permitted under amended SFAS 148, the Company had prospectively applied the
fair-value-based method to all stock options granted on or after January1, 2003. The
Company recognized share-based compensation for all stock options granted on or after
January1, 2003 and presented the disclosures required by SFAS 123.   
On January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, using the
modified prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective
transition method, the consolidated financial statements have not been restated to
reflect the impact of SFAS 123R.   
Under SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective method, compensation expense is
recognized for all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of,
January1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
original provisions of SFAS 123 and compensation expense is recognized for all
share-based payments granted on or after January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. 37 Notes to Consolidated Financial

The Company recorded in income $01million related to the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle as of January1, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 123, the Company
recognized compensation expense assuming all awards will vest and reversed recognized
compensation expense for forfeited awards only when the awards were actually forfeited.
SFAS 123R requires an estimate of forfeitures when recognizing share-based
compensation expense. Note 9b provides supplemental disclosure for the Companys
stock options.

Advertising costs   
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs amounted to $784 in 2007

Impairment of long-lived assets   
An impairment is recognized when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset to be held
and used exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected from its use and disposal,
and is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair
value. A long-lived asset should be tested when events or circumstances indicate that
its carrying amount may not be recoverable. During 2007 and 2006, the Company has not
identified any indicators that would require testing for an impairment.   
o
Derivative instruments   
Derivative instruments are used to hedge the Companys exposure to changes in interest
rates. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value
based on quoted market prices and are recorded in either current or non-current assets
or liabilities based on their maturity. Changes in the fair values of derivatives are
recorded in income or other comprehensive income, based on whether the instrument is
designated as a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. Gains or
losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified
to income in the period the hedged item affects income. If the underlying hedged
transaction ceases to exist, any associated amounts reported in other comprehensive
income are reclassified into income at that time. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in
income in the current period. 38 Notes to Consolidated Financial

Claims and insurance accruals   
Claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated total cost of claims, including
amounts for claims incurred but not reported, for cargo loss and damage, bodily injury
and property damage, workers compensation, long-term disability and group health. In
Canada and the United States, the Company has self-insurance retention amounts per
incident for auto liability, casualty and cargo claims. In the United States, the
Company has self-insurance retention amounts per incident for workers compensation and
employee medical. In establishing these accruals, management evaluates and monitors
each claim individually, and uses factors such as historical experience, known trends
and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability.

Deferred share units   
The Company maintains a deferred share unit DSU plan for all directors. Under this
plan, all directors receive units at the end of each quarter based on the market price
of common shares equivalent to Cdn. $2,50000. The Company records compensation expense
and the corresponding liability each period initially for Cdn. $2,50000 and
subsequently based on changes in the market price of common shares.   
In addition to the directors DSU plan, the Company adopted a DSU plan for senior
executives. Under this plan, eligible senior executives receive units at the end of
each quarter based on the market price of common shares equivalent to the senior
executives entitlement. The entitlement amount varies based on the senior executives
position in the Company and the years of eligible service. The maximum entitlement
amount varies between $2,50000 and $20,00000 per annum. The Company records
compensation expense and the corresponding liability each period based on the market
price of common shares. 39 Notes to Consolidated Financial

Use of estimates   
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year. Significant estimates are
used in determining, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred
tax assets, claims and insurance accruals, share-based compensation, intangible asset
values and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.   2.

credit facility maturing July31, 2012. The Company had $560million bearing interest
at 631%, outstanding under the term facility at December31, 2007. The provisions of
the term facility impose certain financial maintenance tests. At December31, 2007, the
Company was in compliance with these financial maintenance tests. The Company had an additional $29million, bearing interest at 474%, outstanding under
a separate term credit facility maturing on September30, 2010. This term credit
facility was assumed as part of the acquisition of PJAX on October2, 2006.   b

Income taxes continued   
At December31, 2007, the Company had approximately $237million of net operating loss
carryforwards available to reduce future years taxable income for which a deferred tax asset
has been recognized. The net operating loss was generated in 2007 and will expire in 2027 if
not utilized.   
The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No48, Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes, on January1, 2007. The implementation of Interpretation 48 did not result
in a change in the estimated liability for unrecognized tax benefits at January1, 2007. At
December31, 2007, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $21million,
of which an estimated $19million if recognized would have an impact on the effective tax
rate.   
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the tax
provision. At December31, 2007, the Company did not recognize a material amount of interest
and penalties. The Company had approximately $06million accrued for interest and
penalties.   
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in U.S. and Canadian federal
jurisdictions, and various states, provinces and foreign jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue
Service and Canada Revenue Agency had in 2007 commenced examinations of the 2003, 2004 and
2005 income tax returns. The examinations are expected to be completed by 2008. These
audits may impact the Companys unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12months; however, the
estimated financial outcome is indeterminable at this time. Overall, the years 1999 to 2006
remain open to examination by tax authorities.

Stock options   
The Company provides a stock option plan to key employees, officers and directors to
encourage executives to acquire a meaningful equity ownership interest in the Company
over a period of time and, as a result, reinforce executives attention on the long-term
interest of the Company and its shareholders. Under the plan, options to purchase
common shares of the Company may be granted to key employees, officers and directors of
the Company by the Board of Directors or by the Companys Compensation Committee. There
are 820,200 options outstanding under the plan. The term of each option is 10years and
the vesting period is five years. The exercise price for options is the trading price
of the common shares of the Company on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day of the
grant. The Company adopted SFAS Statement 123R on January1, 2006 as described in
note 1l.   
The weighted average estimated fair value at the date of the grant for the options
granted during 2007 was $712 2006 $769 per share.

Risk management activities The Company is exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing variable rate
debt. The Company has entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps on variable rate
term debt and revolving debt. The swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The
effective portions of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and are recognized into earnings in the same period in
which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Ineffective portions of changes in
fair value are recognized into earnings as they occur. At December31, 2007, the notional
amount of the swaps was $689million, with the average pay rate being 494% and the average
receive rate being 483%. The swaps mature at various dates up to December31, 2011. 52  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Financial instruments   
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank overdraft, accounts receivable, and
accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate the carrying values because of the
short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of the Companys long-term debt,
determined based on the future cash flows associated with each debt instrument discounted
using an estimate of the Companys current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of
comparable maturity, is approximately equal to the carrying value at December31, 2007 and
2006. 55 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Total rental expense under operating leases was $156million for the year ended December31,
2007 2006 $163million; 2005 $173million. The Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual values of certain assets under operating
leases. If the market value of the assets at the end of the lease terms is less than the
guaranteed residual value, the Company must, under certain circumstances, compensate the
lessor for a portion of the shortfall. The maximum exposure under these guarantees is $22
million. 15. Employee benefits The Company sponsors defined contribution plans in Canada and the United States. In Canada,
the Company matches the employees contribution to their registered retirement savings plan up
to a maximum contribution. In the United States, the Company sponsors 401k savings plans.
The Company matches a percentage of the employees contribution subject to a maximum
contribution. The expense related to the plans was $21million for the year ended December
31, 2007 2006 $20million. 56 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Contingent liabilities   
The Company is subject to legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. In
the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, with respect to these actions,
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. Legal costs are expensed as incurred.

United States and Canadian accounting policy differences   
In accordance with the provisions of the OBCA, issuers that are required to file reports with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States are allowed to file financial
statements under United States GAAP to meet their continuous disclosure obligations in Canada.
Vitran has included a reconciliation highlighting the material differences between its
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with United States GAAP compared to
its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP as described
below. This disclosure is required for a finite period of time under the Ontario Securities
Commission regulations, subsequent to the adoption of United States GAAP. Prior to 2006,
Vitran prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian GAAP with a
reconciliation to United States GAAP. 57 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

The adoption of SFAS 123R, Share-Based Payments, as described in note
1l only applies to United States GAAP. Therefore, the effect of a change in
accounting principle does not impact Canadian GAAP net income or shareholders
equity.   ii
The Company had foreign exchange losses of $22million that did not
represent a substantially complete liquidation of a foreign operation. In previous
years, the Company had foreign exchange gains of $09million that did not represent
a substantially complete liquidation of a foreign operation. Under Canadian GAAP,
these gains were recognized upon the transfer into income of the related cumulative
translation adjustment. Under United States GAAP, there is no reduction of the
cumulative translation adjustment account. Retained earnings under Canadian GAAP on
a cumulative basis is decreased by $14million 2006 increased $09million with
a corresponding increase 2006 decrease to the cumulative translation adjustment
included in accumulated other comprehensive income. 58  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued

Share-based compensation   
Effective January1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R as described in note 1l.
SFAS 123R requires compensation expense be recognized for all share-based payments
granted prior to, but not yet vested, as of January1, 2006, based on the grant date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. This is not
required under Canadian GAAP based on the transitional provision of CICA 3870,
Stock-Based Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments, which Vitran adopted January1,
2003. Canadian GAAP requires pro forma net income and income per share disclosure for
stock option grants during 2002.   
The following table outlines the impact if the compensation cost for the Companys stock
options granted from January1, 2002 through to December31, 2002 were determined under
the fair value-based method. The Company has applied the pro forma disclosure provisions
of the standard to these awards. The pro forma effect of awards granted prior to January
1, 2002 has not been included.

Derivative accounting and financial instruments   
Previously under Canadian GAAP, gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as
hedges and that manage the underlying risks of anticipated transactions are not recorded
until the underlying hedged item is recorded in net income and hedge ineffectiveness is
not recorded until settlement. On January1, 2007, the Company adopted CICA 3865,
Hedges, in accordance with the transitional provisions. Under the transitional
provisions, any hedging relationships that existed and satisfy all the conditions of CICA
3865 are adjusted to the carrying amounts that would have resulted had CICA 3865 always
been applied. Based on the transitional provision there is no longer a difference in
accounting for derivatives for the Company between United States and Canadian GAAP.   
On January1, 2007, the Company adopted CICA 3855, Financial Instruments Recognition
and Measurement. Management evaluated the effect of the standard on the consolidated
financial statements and concluded that the Company does not have a difference between
United States and Canadian GAAP upon adoption of the standard.   
d
Comprehensive income   
On January1, 2007, the Company adopted CICA 1530, Comprehensive Income, in accordance with the
appropriate provisions of the standard. The Company reports comprehensive income as part of its
United States GAAP reporting, therefore, the adoption of this standard eliminates this presentation
difference between United States and Canadian GAAP. However, there may be measurement differences
between comprehensive income under United States and Canadian GAAP. 60 Consolidated Supplemental Schedule of Quarterly Financial Information
