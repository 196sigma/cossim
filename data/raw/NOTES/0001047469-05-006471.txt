We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BroadVision,Inc. the Company as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BroadVision,Inc. at
December31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December31, 2004, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the effectiveness of the Company internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission COSO and our report dated March11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and an
adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting due the existence of material weaknesses. s/

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    
To
The Board of Directors and Stockholders of BroadVision, Inc. and Subsidiaries: 
We
have audited management assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that BroadVision, Inc. and Subsidiaries the
Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
A
company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. A company internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 3 provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim
financial statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management assessment. As of December 31, 2004, 1the
Company accounting and finance department was not adequately staffed, trained and supervised; 2management review of account reconciliations was not adequate to detect errors in certain
account reconciliations, and 3the Company procedures for reviewing the accuracy of maintenance revenue data entered into the Company accounting system were not adequate to detect
keypunch or other errors or omissions. None of the foregoing control deficiencies resulted in adjustments to the 2004 annual or interim consolidated financial statements. However, each of these
control deficiencies results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement to the Company annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. Accordingly,
management has determined that each of these control deficiencies constitutes a material weakness. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit
tests applied in our audit of the Company consolidated 
57  financial
statements as of and for the year ended December31, 2004, and this report does not affect our report dated March 11, 2005 on those consolidated financial statements. 
In
our opinion, management assessment that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion,
because of the effects of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. 
We
do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management statements regarding corrective actions taken by the Company after December31, 2004. 
We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BroadVision, Inc
as of December31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income loss, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December31, 2004 and our report dated March11, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. s/

BROADVISION,INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements      December31, 2004    
Note1Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Business 
BroadVision,Inc. collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company was incorporated in the state of Delaware on May13, 1993 and has been a
publicly-traded corporation since 1996. BroadVision develops, markets, and supports enterprise portal applications that enable companies to unify their e-business infrastructure and
conduct both interactions and transactions with employees, partners, and customers through a personalized self-service model that increases revenues, reduces costs, and improves
productivity. 
Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the Company opinion, the consolidated financial statements presented herein include all necessary adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring adjustments, to fairly state the
Company financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods indicated. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from estimates. Revenue Recognition 
Overview 
The Company revenue consists of fees for licenses of the Company software products, maintenance, consulting services and customer training. The Company
generally charges fees for licenses of its software products either based on the number of persons registered to use the product or based on the number of Central Processing Units CPUs on which
the product is installed. Licenses for software whereby fees charged are based upon the number of persons registered to use the product are differentiated between licenses for development use and
licenses for use in deployment of the customer website. Licenses for software whereby fees charged are on a per-CPU basis do not differentiate between development and deployment usage.
The Company revenue recognition policies are in accordance with SOP97-2, as amended; SOP 98-9, and the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin
No104, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. 
The
Company licenses its products through its direct sales force and indirectly through resellers. In general, software license revenues are recognized when a non-cancelable
license agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay, the software product has been delivered, there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance,
the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer, which generally
occurs when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier. In case of electronic delivery, delivery occurs when the customer is given access to the licensed programs. If
collectibility is not considered probable, revenue is recognized when the fee is collected. Subscription-based license revenues are recognized 
63  ratably
over the subscription period. The Company enters into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to the Company based upon a percentage of list price. The Company
does not grant its resellers the right of return. Revenue generated under reseller agreements is recognized upon obtaining evidence of the resale of the license rights from the reseller to one or more
end users. 
The
Company recognizes revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of SOP97-2, as amended by SOP 98-9. Revenues recognized from
multiple-element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements, such as licenses for software products, maintenance, consulting
services or customer training. The determination of fair value is based on objective evidence, which is specific to the Company. The Company limits its assessment of objective evidence for each
element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so, for an element not yet sold separately. If
evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements, then revenue is recognized using the residual method. Under the residual
method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue. 
The
Company records unearned revenue for software license agreements when cash has been received from the customer and the agreement does not qualify for revenue recognition under the
Company revenue recognition policy. The Company records accounts receivable for software license agreements when the agreement qualifies for revenue recognition but cash or other consideration has
not been received from the customer. 
Services Revenue 
Consulting services revenues and customer training revenues are recognized as such services are performed. Maintenance revenues, which include revenues bundled
with software license agreements that entitle the customers to technical support and future unspecified enhancements to the Company
products, are deferred and recognized ratably over the related agreement period, generally twelve months. The
Company consulting services, which consist of consulting, maintenance and training, are delivered through BVGS. Services that the Company provides are not essential to the
functionality of the software. In accordance with EITF 01-14, which the Company adopted as of January1, 2002, the Company records reimbursement by its customers for
out-of-pocket expenses as an increase to services revenues. 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments 
We consider all debt and equity securities with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Short-term cash investments consist of debt and equity securities that have a remaining maturity of less than one year as of the date of the balance sheet. Cash and cash investments that
serve as collateral for financial instruments such as letters of credit are classified as restricted. Restricted cash in which the underlying instrument has a term of greater than twelve months from
the balance sheet date are classified as non-current. 
64  Management
determines the appropriate classification of cash investments at the time of purchase and evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. All cash investments to
date have been classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value with related unrealized gains or losses reported as other comprehensive income loss, net of tax.
Total short-term and long-term investment unrealized gains losses was $49,000 as of December31, 2003. Total realized gains during fiscal years 2004 and 2003 were
$573,000 and $11million, respectively, and are included in other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Our
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments consisted of the following as of December31, 2004 and 2003 in thousands: Classified on Balance Sheet as Purchase/

Under the criteria set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No86, Accounting for the Cost of Computer
Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility in the form of a working model has been established at which time such costs are capitalized and recorded at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. The costs
incurred subsequent to the establishment of a working model but prior to general release of the product have not been significant. To date, the Company has not capitalized any costs related to the
development of software for external use. 
Advertising Costs 
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense, which is included in sales and marketing expense, amounted to $82,000, $122,000, and $571,000 in
2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. 
Prepaid Royalties 
Prepaid royalties relating to purchased software to be incorporated and sold with the Company software products are amortized as a cost of software licenses
either on a straight-line basis over the 
65  remaining
term of the royalty agreement or on the basis of projected product revenues, whichever results in greater amortization. Allowances and Reserves 
Occasionally, the Company customers experience financial difficulty after the Company records the sale but before payment has been received. The Company
maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company normal payment terms are generally 30 to
90days from invoice date. If the financial condition of the Company customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be
required. 
Restructuring 
The Company has approved certain restructuring plans to, among other things, reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. These restructuring charges were
taken to align the Company cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. The Company restructuring charges are comprised primarily of:
iseverance and benefits termination costs related to the reduction of the Company workforce; iilease termination costs and/or costs associated with permanently vacating its
facilities; iiiother incremental costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan; and ivimpairment costs related to certain long-lived assets abandoned. The
Company accounts for severance and benefits termination costs in accordance with EITF 94-3 for exit or disposal activities initiated prior to January1, 2003.
Accordingly, the Company records the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions have been met: imanagement with the appropriate level of authority approves a
termination plan that commits the Company to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination; iithe benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in
sufficient detail to enable
the employees to determine the termination benefits; iiithe plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their locations and their job classifications; and
ivthe period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely. The termination costs recorded by the Company are not associated with nor do they benefit
continuing activities. The Company accounts for severance and benefits termination costs for exit or disposal activities initiated after January1, 2003 in accordance with SFAS146.
SFAS146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred. This differs
from EITF 94-3, which required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of an entity commitment to an exit plan. 
Prior
to the adoption on January1, 2003 of SFAS146, the Company accounted for the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment in accordance with EITF
88-10. Accordingly, the Company recorded the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the Company. 
The
Company accounts for the costs associated with lease termination and/or abandonment in accordance with EITF 88-10. Accordingly, the Company records the costs associated
with lease 
66  termination
and/or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the Company. Under EITF 88-10, the Company records the liability associated with lease
termination and/or abandonment as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs, less probable sublease income. The Company accounts for costs related to long-lived
assets abandoned in accordance with SFAS No144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and, accordingly,
charges to expense the net carrying value of the long-lived assets when the Company ceases to use the assets. 
Inherent
in the estimation of the costs related to the Company restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to
accomplish the restructuring. In determining the charge related to the restructuring, the majority of estimates made by management related to the charge for excess facilities. In determining the
charge for excess facilities, the Company was required to estimate future sublease income, future net operating expenses of the facilities, and brokerage commissions, among other expenses. The most
significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce the Company lease obligations. The Company based its estimates of sublease income, in
part, on the opinions of independent real estate experts, current market conditions and rental rates, an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made, the status of
negotiations with potential subtenants, and the location of the respective facility, among other factors. 
These
estimates, along with other estimates made by management in connection with the restructuring, may vary significantly depending, in part, on factors that may be beyond the
Company control. Specifically, these estimates will depend on the Company success in negotiating with lessors, the time
periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases. Adjustments to the facilities reserve will be required if actual lease exit costs or
sublease income differ from amounts currently expected. The Company will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and, if appropriate, record changes to its restructuring
obligations in current operations based on management most current estimates. Legal Matters 
The Company current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the Company can estimate the amount and range of loss. The Company has recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims, where there is a range of loss. Because of the
uncertainties related to both the determination of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the amount and range of loss in the event of an unfavorable outcome, the Company is unable to make a
reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from the remaining pending litigation. As additional information becomes available, the Company will assess the potential liability related to
its pending litigation and revise its estimates, if necessary. Such revisions in the Company estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the Company results of operations and
financial position. 
Property and Equipment 
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives two to eight years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of 
67  the
remaining life of the lease term or their estimated useful lives. Depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $37million 113million, and $182million, respectively. In 2004 the company recorded asset impairments in connection with the settlements reached with several landlords for termination of
leases, including transferring ownership of certain furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements with a net book value of $85million to the previous landlords. The Company recorded asset
impairments of approximately $515,000 during fiscal 2003 in connection with the Company restructuring plan, which are included in the restructuring charge recorded in the Company Consolidated
Statement of Operations. In 2002, the Company recorded a $31million asset impairment from the physical count of the Company assets. 
Valuation of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company periodically assesses the impairment of long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of SFAS144. The Company assesses the
impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with SFAS No141, Business Combinations and SFAS142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS142 as of January1, 2002. Please see Note4 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
Employee Stock Option and Purchase Plans 
The Company accounts for employee stock-based awards in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion 25, Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
No44 FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensationan Interpretation of APB Opinion 25, and related interpretations. As such, compensation expense is
recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price. Pursuant to SFAS123, the Company discloses the pro forma effects of using
the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation arrangements. The Company accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS123 and Emerging Issues Task Force EITF 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees For Acquiring or in
Conjunction with Selling Goods or Services.
The
Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations when accounting for its stock option and stock purchase plans. In accordance with APB Opinion 25, we apply the intrinsic
value method in accounting for employee stock options. Accordingly, the Company generally recognizes no compensation expense with respect to stock-based awards to employees. 
For
the year ended December31, 2004, the Company recorded compensation income of $19,000 as a result of a vesting modification of a grant to a third-party consultant common stock
in the Company. During the year ended December31, 2003, the Company recorded compensation expense of $342,000. This charge was recorded as a result of granting a third-party consultant shares
of our common stock and a vesting modification to a grant for a terminated employee. The compensation charge was calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Of the total charge, $131,000 is recorded in
general and administrative expense, $67,000 is recorded in sales and marketing expense and the remaining $144,000 is related to employees terminated under the Company restructuring plan and
therefore is included in the restructuring charge.

On
February7, 2002, the Board of Directors approved an increase by an amount not to exceed 5% of the number of shares outstanding for issuance under the Company Employee Stock
Purchase Plan the Purchase Plan. The Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock equivalent to a percentage of the employee earnings, not to exceed 15%, at a price equal to
85% of the fair market value of the common stock at dates specified by the Board of Directors as provided in the Plan. Under the Purchase Plan, the Company issued approximately 2,070,070, 365,049, and
555,278 shares to employees in the years ended December31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Under SFAS123, compensation cost is recognized for the fair value of the employees'
purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with no expected dividends, an expected life of approximately 24months, and the following weighted-average

On
July24, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a one-for-nine reverse split of its common stock. The reverse split was
effective as of 8:00p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July29, 2002. Each nine shares of outstanding common stock of the Company automatically converted into one share of common stock. The
Company common stock began trading on a post-split basis at the opening of trading on the Nasdaq National Market on July30, 2002. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and related financial information contained herein have been retroactively restated to give effect for the July2002 reverse
stock split. 
Earnings Per Share Information 
Basic income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, less shares subject to repurchase. Diluted
income loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from outstanding stock options and warrants
using the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the basic and diluted net income loss per share computational data for the periods presented. Excluded from the computation of diluted
loss per share 
70  for
the years ended December31, 2003, and 2002, are options and warrants to acquire 1,231,000, and 552,000 shares of common stock, respectively, because their effects would be

During fiscal 2004, the Company changed the functional currencies of all foreign subsidiaries from the U.S. dollar to the local currency of the respective
countries. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the period.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency assets and liabilities are included in other income expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Comprehensive Income Loss 
Comprehensive income loss includes net income loss and other comprehensive income loss, which consists of unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities and cumulative translation adjustments. Total comprehensive income loss is presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Stockholders'
Equity. Total accumulated other comprehensive income loss is displayed as a separate component of stockholder equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The

Income taxes are computed using an asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and
deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred tax assets is
reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 
The
Company analyzes its deferred tax assets with regard to potential realization. The Company has established a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets to the extent that
management has determined that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized based upon the uncertainty of their realization. The Company has
considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance. 
Segment and Geographic Information 
The Company operates in one segment, electronic commerce business solutions. The Company chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Company CEO.
The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region and by product for purposes of making operating
decisions and assessing financial performance. 
Reclassifications 
Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
72  New Accounting Pronouncements 
In January2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities. FIN 46 expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets, liabilities and
activities of another entity. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either idoes not have equity
investors with voting rights or iihas equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. FIN 46 requires a variable interest entity
to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity
residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to older
entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December15, 2003. Disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after January31, 2003. We do not
expect the adoption of SFAS146 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In
May2003, the FASB issued SFAS150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity. SFAS150 requires that certain financial instruments, which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity, must now be accounted for as liabilities. The
financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock, certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other
assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock. SFAS150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May31, 2003, and otherwise is
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June15, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS150 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. 
In
December2004, the FASB issued SFAS No123 revised 2004 Share-Based Payment, or SFAS123R, which replaces SFAS
No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or SFAS123, and supercedes APB Opinion No25 Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period beginning after June15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously
permitted under
SFAS123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. We have
not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS123R. We are assessing the requirements of SFAS123R and expect that its adoption will have a material impact on
the Company results of operations and earnings loss per share. 
In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No153 SFAS153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No29, Accounting
for Nonmonetary Transactions. SFAS153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in
paragraph21b of APB Opinion No29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it 
73  with
an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS153 is effective for periods beginning after June15, 2005. We do not expect that adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material effect
on our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or liquidity.

and amortization expense for the years ended December31, 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $37million, $113million, and $182million, respectively.
In 2004, the Company transferred ownership of certain furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements with a net book value of $85million to previous landlords as a part of a settlement
relating to future real estate obligations. The Company recorded asset impairments of approximately $515,000 during fiscal 2003 in connection with the Company restructuring plan, which is included
in the Company restructuring charge recorded in the Company Statement of Operations. In 2002, the Company recorded a $31million asset impairment as a result of the physical inventories of
the Company assets. 
Note3Goodwill and Other Intangibles 
On January1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS142, Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Under
SFAS142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but are tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value approach, and whenever
there is an impairment indicator. Other intangible assets continue to be valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Pursuant to SFAS142, the Company is required to test its goodwill for
impairment upon adoption and annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company concluded that, based upon the market value of its
stock in relation to the Company net book value at December31, 2004 and 2003, there was no impairment of goodwill as of December31, 2004 and 2003. 
The
process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In estimating the fair value of the Company, the Company made
estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows. The Company forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company is using to manage the
business. Changes in these estimates could change the Company conclusion regarding impairment of goodwill and 
74  potentially
result in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge, for all or a portion of the goodwill balance at December31, 2004. 
Additionally,
upon adoption of SFAS141 and 142, the Company no longer amortizes its non-technology based intangible asset, or assembled workforce. Amortization
expense for completed technology intangibles was $886,000 and $35million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of December31, 2003, completed technology intangibles had been fully
amortized.

November2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of up to $200million of convertible debentures to five institutional
investors. The Company issued an initial $160million of debentures, which will be convertible into common stock at a fixed conversion price of $276 per share. The notes bear interest at a
rate of six percent per annum and are repayable in either cash or common stock beginning in June2005 for a period of up to three years, depending on the occurrence of certain events. Payment
of both principal and interest may be made in either cash or, provided that the Company obtains shareholder approval, common stock of the Company. The Company intends to pay these debentures by
issuing stock. As of December31, 2004, a total of $160million in face value convertible debentures was outstanding. These debentures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at
December31, 2004, at the discounted amount of $120million. The 
75  Company
is recording the difference between the face value and discounted amount as additional interest expense over the estimated life of the debentures. The Company may be required to make
additional repayments of up to $1million per month under the notes, contingent upon maintaining certain minimum net cash on hand balances. Our payment of these additional amounts may be in
cash and/or common stock pursuant to similar terms as the payment of regular installment amounts. In connection with this transaction, the Company also issued warrants to purchase shares of its common
stock. See Note9. 
As
December31, 2004 and December31, 2003, outstanding term debt borrowings were approximately $10million and $19million, respectively. Borrowings bear
interest at the bank prime rate 525% as of December31, 2004 and 400% as of December31, 2003 plus up to 125%. Principal and interest are due in monthly payments through maturity
based on the terms of the facilities. Principal payments of $637,000 are due in 2005, and payments of $390,000 are due thereafter. In
November2004, the Company renewed and amended its revolving credit facility. The amount available under the revolving line of credit is $200million. Borrowings under
the revolving line of credit are collateralized by all of the Company assets and bear interest at the bank prime rate 525% as of December31, 2004 and 40% as of December31,
2003. As of December31, 2004 and 2003, $200million and $270million, respectively, remaining outstanding under the Company renewed and amended revolving credit facility.

Company has provided a valuation allowance for all of its deferred tax assets as of December31, 2004 and 2003, due to the uncertainty regarding their future realization. The
total valuation allowance decreased $298million from December31, 2003 to December31, 2004. The decrease in valuation allowance relates primarily to changes in accrued
liabilities. As of December31, 2004, the Company had federal and state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $4464million and $1213million respectively, available to
offset future regular and alternative minimum taxable 
77  income.
In addition, the Company had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $111million and $30million, respectively, available to offset
future tax liabilities. The Company federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards expire in the tax years 2005 through 2024, if not utilized. The state net operating loss carryforwards
expire in the tax years 2005 through 2014. The state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal
and state tax laws limit the use of net operating loss carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. The Company believes such an
ownership change, as defined, may have occurred and, accordingly, certain of the Company federal and state operating loss carryforwards may be limited in their annual usage. 
During
the year, the Company performed additional procedures to determine the amount of tax attribute carry-forwards. As a result of this analysis, a decrease in the Deferred Tax Assets
and a
corresponding Valuation Allowance was made. Since there is a full Valuation Allowance on the Deferred Tax Assets, there is no provision impact as a result of this change. In
accordance with SFAS5, the Company maintains reserves for estimated income tax exposures for many jurisdictions when the exposure item becomes probable and estimable.
Exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Exposures can also be affected by changes in
applicable tax law or other factors, which may cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate. Management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for
income tax exposures; however, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. As of December31, 2004, the Company has recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately
$31million. 
Note7Commitments and Contingencies 
Warranties and Indemnification 
The Company provides a warranty to its customers that its software will perform substantially in accordance with documentation typically for a period of
90days following receipt of the software. The Company also indemnifies certain customers from third-party claims of intellectual property infringement relating to the use of its products.
Historically, costs related to these guarantees have not been significant and the Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on its future results of operations. Our
software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual property infringement claims. To date, no such claims have been filed against us. 
The
Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer is, or was, serving in such capacity. The term of the
indemnification period is for so long as such officer or director is subject to an indemnifiable event by reason of the fact that such person was serving in such capacity. The maximum potential amount
of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that limits its exposure
and enables the Company to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result of the Company insurance policy coverage, the Company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification
agreements is 
78  insignificant.
Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of either December31, 2004 or 2003. The Company assesses the need for an indemnification reserve on
a quarterly basis and there can be no guarantee that an indemnification reserve will not become necessary in the future. Leases 
The Company leases its headquarters facility and its other facilities under noncancelable operating lease agreements expiring through the year 2010. Under the
terms of the agreements, the Company is required to pay property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs. 
A
summary of total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating lease agreements, including future minimum facilities payments for properties that are part of
restructuring is as follows in millions: Years ending December 31, 
Total future
minimum lease
payments 2005 254 2006 60 2007 09 2008 05 2009 and thereafter through October 2010 05 Total minimum facilities payments 333 Of
this accrual, $219million relates to payments due in fiscal 2005 under lease termination agreements, and $114million relates to future minimum lease payments, fees
and expenses, net of estimated sublease income and planned company occupancy. The future minimum lease payment accrual is net of approximately $28million of sublease income to be received
under non-cancelable sublease agreements signed prior to December31, 2004. See Note9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Equity Investments 
In January2000, the Company entered into a limited partnership agreement with a venture capital firm under which it was obligated to contribute capital
based upon the periodic funding requirements. The total capital commitment was $20million, of which $11million had been contributed through December31, 2003. In
September2004, the Company sold its interest in the partnership agreement for approximately $576,000 in cash and recorded a loss of approximately $230,000. That loss is included in Other
Income Expense, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. As a result of this sale, the Company obligation to make future capital contributions has been extinguished. 
Standby Letter of Credit Commitments 
Commitments totaling $243million and $198million in the form of standby letters of credit were issued on the Company behalf from financial
institutions as of December31, 2004 and 2003, 
79  respectively,
in favor of the Company various landlords to secure obligations under the Company facility leases. 
Legal Proceedings 
On June7, 2001, Verity,Inc. filed suit against the Company alleging copyright infringement, breach of contract, unfair competition and other
claims. In August2003, the Company reached a confidential settlement with Verity,Inc. with respect to our outstanding litigation. The detailed terms and conditions of this settlement
are confidential and cannot be disclosed without the consent of each party. The settlement did not have a material effect on the Company business, financial condition or results of operations. 
On
July18, 2002, Avalon Partners,Inc., doing business as Cresa Partners Cresa, filed a suit against the Company in the Superior Court of the State of California, San
Mateo County, claiming broker commissions related to the Company termination and restructuring of certain facilities leases associated with our restructuring plans taken during the second quarter of
2002. The Company settled with Avalon Partners,Inc., doing business as Cresa Partners Cresa with a one-time payment of $22million to Cresa in April2003. On
June 10, 2004, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company MetLife filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, naming the Company as a
defendant. The complaint alleged that the Company was liable for unlawful detainer of premises leased from the plaintiff. The plaintiff thereafter filed a First Amended Complaint alleging that the
Company no longer held possession of the premises but was in breach of the lease. In February 2005, MetLife and the Company reached agreement and executed documents regarding a settlement of the
pending lawsuit under which the Company will pay MetLife an aggregate of $1,927,500 in consideration for termination of the lease, dismissal of the lawsuit and in full settlement of approximately $31
million of past and future lease obligations. The first of three installment payments was made in February 2005, with the second due in May 2005 and the third due in September 2005. 
On
January 7, 2005, we announced that we had reached agreement with the SEC to settle administrative proceedings in connection with the restatement of our financial results for the third
quarter of fiscal 2001. No fines or financial penalties associated with the settlement. Without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, we consented to the SEC entry of an administrative order that
included findings that we issued a false and misleading earnings press release and misleading quarterly report. The order requires that we cease and desist from committing or causing violations of
specified provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC found that a former executive in charge of professional services who left BroadVision in 2002 was responsible for the improper accounting.
The restatement concerned revenue related to one software license agreement. Following receipt of payment in full by the customer, we recognized revenue on that agreement in its entirety in the third
quarter of 2001. We subsequently determined that the revenue should instead be recognized ratably over the four-year life of the agreement, and announced on April 1, 2002 that we were restating our
financial statements for the third quarter of 2001 to effect this change. We have been accounting for the revenue ratably in all periods since the third quarter of 2001. 
80  The
Company is also subject to various other claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with legal counsel, the
ultimate disposition of these matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company business, financial condition or results of operations. Although management currently believes that the
outcome of other outstanding legal proceedings, claims and litigation involving the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition,
litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company business, results of operations or
financial condition. 
Note8Restructuring 
The Company approved restructuring plans to, among other things, reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities. These restructuring and asset impairment charges
were taken to align our cost structure with changing market conditions and to create a more efficient organization. In fiscal 2004, the Company reached agreement with several landlords to extinguish
approximately $155million of obligations related to excess facility leases, which contributed to a pre-tax net restructuring credit during the year of $235million.
Pre-tax restructuring charges of $354million and $1104million were recorded during the years ended December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For each period, the
Company recorded the low-end of a range of assumptions modeled for the restructuring charges, in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting for
Contingencies. Adjustments to the restructuring accrual will be made in future periods, if necessary, based upon the then current actual events and circumstances. 
The
following table summarizes the restructuring accrual activity recorded during the three-years ended December31, 2004 in thousands: Severance
and Benefits
Facilities/
Excess Assets
Total Accrual balances, December31, 2001 930 89,859 90,789 Restructuring charges 8,707 101,742 110,449 Cash payments 8,026 78,019 86,045 Non-cash portion 107 18,891 18,998 Accrual balances, December31, 2002 1,504 94,691 96,195 Restructuring charges 1,509 33,847 35,356 Cash payments 2,342 23,829 26,171 Accrual balances, December31, 2003 671 104,709 105,380 Restructuring charges credits 1,114 24,659 23,545 Cash payments 961 46,711 47,672 Accrual balances, December31, 2004 824 33,339 34,163 The
severance and benefits accrual for each period includes severance, payroll taxes and COBRA benefits related to restructuring plans implemented prior to the balance sheet date. The
facilities/excess assets accrual for each period included future minimum lease payments, fees and expenses, net of estimated sublease income and planned company occupancy, and related leasehold
improvement amounts payable subsequent to the balance sheet date for which the provisions of EITF 94-3 or 
81  SFAS146,
as applicable, were satisfied. See further discussion below. In determining estimated future sublease income, the following factors were considered, among others: opinions of
independent real estate experts, current market conditions and rental rates, an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made, the status of negotiations with potential
subtenants, and the location of the respective facilities. 
The
nature of the charges and credits in 2004 were as follows: 
Severance and benefitsThe Company recorded a related charge of $11million during the twelve months ended
December31, 2004, related to workforce reductions as a component of the Company restructuring plans executed during the year. The Company estimates that the accrual as of December31,
2004, will be paid in full by December31, 2005. 
Facilities/excess assetsDuring the twelve months ended December31, 2004, the Company recorded a facilities-related
restructuring credit of $247million. During the third and fourth quarters of 2004, the Company reached agreements with certain landlords to extinguish approximately $155million of
future real estate obligations. The Company made cash payments of $190million during the third quarter and $17million during the fourth quarter, and is, as of December31,
2004, obligated to make additional cash payments of $219million in fiscal 2005. Standby letters of credit of $219million were issued on our behalf from financial institutions as of
December31, 2004, in favor of the landlords to secure the fiscal 2005 payments. Accordingly, $219million, along with additional letters of credit securing other long-term
leases of $23million, has been included in restricted cash in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December31, 2004. The Company also transferred ownership of certain
furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements with a net book value of $85million to the previous landlords. 
As
a component of the settlement of one of the previous leases, the Company has a residual lease obligation beginning in 2007 of approximately $91million. The Company may make
an additional cash payment of $45million if it exercises an option to terminate this residual real estate obligation prior to the commencement of the lease term January2007. This
option to terminate the residual lease obligation is accounted for in accordance with SFAS146 and is a part of the restructuring credit of $246million recorded in fiscal 2004. 
In
connection with one of the buyout transactions, the Company issued to the landlord a five-year warrant to purchase approximately 700,000 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $500 per share, exercisable beginning in August2005. See Note10. As
of December31, 2004, $28million of estimated future sublease income is netted against the restructuring accrual. 
The
nature of the charges in 2003 is as follows: 
Severance and benefitsThe $15million charge in fiscal 2003 related to workforce reductions as a component of the
Company restructuring plans executed during the year. 
Facilities/excess assetsDuring the twelve months ended December31, 2003, the Company recorded a facilities-related
restructuring charge of $338million. This charge related to the Company revisions of estimates with respect to the planned future occupancy and anticipated future subleases. 
82  These
revisions were necessary due to a reduction in planned future BroadVision space needs and a further decline in the market for commercial real estate. The Company estimated future sublease timing
and rates based upon current market indicators and information obtained from a third party real estate expert. 
The
nature of the charges in 2002 is as follows: 
A
pre-tax charge of $1104million was recorded during fiscal 2002 to provide for restructuring actions and other related items. The Company recorded the
low-end of a range of assumptions modeled for the restructuring charges, in accordance with SFAS No5, Accounting
for Contingencies. The high-end of the range was estimated at $1178million for the charge related to fiscal 2002. 
Severance and benefitsThe Company recorded a charge of approximately $87million during fiscal year ended
December31, 2002 for restructuring-related severance and benefit costs. Included in the $87million is $107,000 of non-cash charges related to a one-time
compensation charge taken as a result of granting certain terminated employees extended vesting of stock options beyond the standard vesting schedule for terminated employees. The compensation charge
was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Approximately $817,000 of severance and benefits related costs remained accrued as of December31, 2001 as a result of the Company
2001 restructuring plan. Approximately $80million of severance and benefits and other costs were paid out during fiscal 2002 and the remaining $10million of severance, payroll taxes
and COBRA benefits was paid through December31, 2003. The Company restructuring plan included plans to terminate the employment of approximately 430 employees in North and South America and
approximately 95 employees throughout Europe and Asia/Pacific during the first three quarters of fiscal 2002, impacting all departments within the Company. The employment of approximately 525
employees was terminated during fiscal year 2002. 
Facilities/excess assetsDuring fiscal year 2002, the Company revised its estimates and expectations with respect to its
facilities disposition efforts due to further consolidation and abandonment of additional facilities and to account for changes in estimates used in the Company 2001 restructuring plan based upon
actual events and circumstances. Total lease termination costs include the impairment of related assets, remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income. The
estimated costs of abandoning these leased facilities, including estimated sublease income, were based on market information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by
the Company. Based on the factors above, a facilities/excess assets charge of $1017million was recorded during fiscal year 2002 and includes non-cash asset impairment charges of
approximately $189million. 
As
of December31, 2004, the total restructuring accrual of $342million consisted of the following in millions: Current
Non-Current
Total Severance and Termination 09 09 Excess Facilities 254 79 333 Total 263 79 342 83 
The
Company estimates that the $09million severance and termination accrual will be paid in full by December31, 2005. We expect to pay the excess facilities amounts
related to restructured or abandoned leased space as follows in millions: Years ending December31, 
Total future

payments 2005 254 2006 60 2007 09 2008 05 2009 and thereafter through October 2010 05 Total minimum facilities payments 333 Of
this excess facilities accrual, $219million relates to payments due in fiscal 2005 under lease termination agreements, and $114million relates to future minimum
lease payments, fees and expenses, net of estimated sublease income and planned company occupancy. 
Activity

2,448,759 471 The
warrant issued in connection with the real estate transaction has a term of five years, and is exercisable beginning in August2005. The warrant issued in
connection with the convertible debentures also has a term of five years and is exercisable beginning in May2005. 
In
accordance with EITF 00-19, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company Own
Stock, the warrants have been included as a short-term liability and were originally valued at fair value on the date of issuance. The warrants are revalued each
period until and unless the warrants are exercised. During fiscal 2004, the Company recorded charges related to the change in fair value from the date of issuance of the 2004 warrants to
December31, 2004, of $754,000. This amount is included as a component of Other Income Expense, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations. If the warrants are exercised
prior to their termination, their carrying value will be transferred to equity. 
Common Stock 
On July24, 2002, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had approved a one-for-nine reverse split of its common stock.
The reverse split was effective July29, 2002. Each nine shares of outstanding common stock of the Company automatically converted into one share of common stock. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements and related financial information contained herein have been retroactively restated to give effect for this stock split. 
During
fiscal 2003 there were no increases in the aggregate number of shares of common stock available to be issued under the Company Equity Incentive Stock Option Plan. During
May2001, the Board of Directors and the stockholders approved an increase in the aggregate number of shares of common stock available to be issued under the Company Equity Incentive Stock
Option Plan by 12,000,000 shares. 
The
Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations when accounting for its stock option and stock purchase plans. As of December31, 2002, the Company had reserved
96million shares of common stock for issuance under its Equity Incentive Plan. Under this plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive or nonqualified stock options at prices not less than
100% or 85%, respectively, of the fair market value of the Company common stock, as determined by the Board of Directors, at the date of grant. The vesting of individual options may vary but in each
case at least 25% 
86  of
the total number of shares subject to options will become exercisable per year. These options generally expire ten years after the grant date. When an employee option is exercised prior to vesting,
any unvested shares so purchased are subject to repurchase by the Company at the original purchase price of the stock upon termination of employment. The Company right to repurchase lapses at a
minimum rate of 20% per year over five years from the date the option was granted or, for new employees, the date of hire. Such right is exercisable only within 90days following termination of
employment. During the year ended December31, 2004, no shares were repurchased. There were 133 unvested shares that were repurchased by the Company during the year ended December31,
2003 at a weighted-average price of $781. As of December31, 2002, 270 shares were subject to repurchase. The
Company President and Chief Executive Officer CEO has options to purchase 1,704,444 shares of common stock at an average exercise price of $3863 per share. The table below is

the year ended December31, 2004, the Company recorded compensation income of $19,000 as a result of a vesting modification of a grant to a third-party consultant common stock
in the Company. During the year ended December31, 2003 the Company recorded compensation expense of $342,000. This charge was recorded as a result of granting terminated employees continued
vesting of their stock options for a period beyond their actual termination date. The compensation charge was calculated using the Black-Scholes model. $131,000 of the charge is recorded in general
and administrative expense, $67,000 is recorded in sales and marketing and the remaining $144,000 is included in restructuring charge as it related to employees terminated under the Company
restructuring plan. 
During
the year ended December31, 2002 the Company recorded compensation expense of $846,000. This charge was recorded as a result of granting terminated employees continued

Note12Subsequent Events 
On January7, 2005, the Company reached agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle administrative proceedings in connection with
the Company restatement of its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2001. There were no fines or financial penalties associated with the settlement. Without admitting or denying any
wrongdoing, BroadVision consented to the Commission entry of an administrative order that included findings that the Company issued a false and misleading earnings press release and misleading
quarterly report. The order requires that the Company cease and desist from committing or causing violations of specified provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC found that a former
executive in charge of professional services who left the Company in 2002 was responsible for the improper accounting. The restatement concerned revenue related to one software license agreement.
Following receipt of payment in full by the customer, the Company recognized revenue on that agreement in its entirety in the third quarter of 2001. The Company subsequently determined that the
revenue should instead be recognized ratably over the four-year life of the agreement, and announced on April1, 2002 that it was restating its financial statements for the third
quarter of 2001 to effect this change. The Company has been accounting for the revenue ratably in all periods since the third quarter of 2001. 
On
June10, 2004, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company MetLife filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, naming the Company as
a defendant. The complaint alleged that the Company was liable for unlawful detainer of premises leased from the plaintiff. The plaintiff thereafter filed a First Amended Complaint alleging that the
Company no longer held possession of the premises but was in breach of the lease. On February10, 2005, the Company announced that MetLife and the Company reached agreement and executed
documents regarding a settlement of the pending lawsuit under which the Company will pay MetLife an aggregate of $1,927,500 in consideration for termination of the lease, dismissal of the lawsuit and
in full settlement of approximately $31million of past and future lease obligations. The first of three installment payments was made in February2005, with the second due in
May2005 and the third due in September2005. This settlement is not expected to have a significant impact on our Consolidated Results of Operations in the quarter ending
March31, 2005.

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
the rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended for our company. Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the rules promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of
December31, 2004, the end of the period covered by this report. This conclusion was based on the identification of three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of
December31, 2004, as described in the following subsection. 
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to
provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how
well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. An
internal control material weakness is a significant deficiency, or aggregation of deficiencies, that does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that material misstatements in
financial statements will be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees in the normal course of their work. An internal control significant deficiency, or aggregation of deficiencies, is one
that could result in a misstatement of the financial statements that is more than inconsequential. 
Our
management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December31, 2004, and this assessment identified three material weaknesses. These
material weaknesses, and our responsive measures, are summarized below: 1.Two
senior accounting managers in our finance department, with a combined ten years of experience working for us, resigned during the fourth quarter of 2004, and we failed to either
hire adequate replacements or adequately train and supervise our existing accounting staff to ensure that the absence of the senior accounting managers would not negatively impact our controls over
financial reporting. Further, in February2005, our Vice President Corporate Controller resigned and left the Company. Subsequent to December31, 2004, we have taken the
following steps to remediate this material weakness Promoted
an experienced member of our finance staff to the position of Director of Accounting overseeing all North American general accounting activities, and initiated a
search for a qualified candidate to fill the vacated position although we currently have no plans to replace the Vice President Corporate Controller position;
Established
clear responsibilities among our accounting personnel and increased their formal interaction and coordination; 
92  Committed
to implement a more comprehensive training program; and
Increased
our chief financial officer responsibilities for overseeing more routine accounting matters until the open personnel position is filled. As
our future staffing is dependent upon filling the open position and retaining existing employees, we are currently unable to determine when this material weakness will be fully remediated. 2.Management
reviews of key account reconciliations failed to detect inconsistencies between amounts stated in the reconciliations of the respective accounts and the general ledger.
These failures are also attributed to inadequate staffing and training, as further described in the preceding paragraphs, and we expect that our remediation efforts associated with our staffing and
training issues also will address this material weakness.
3.Our
procedures for reviewing the accuracy of maintenance contract data were inadequate and could result in a failure to detect and correct keypunch or other errors or omissions.
Subsequent to December31, 2004, in an effort to remediate the risks associated with this issue, we developed a detailed database of worldwide maintenance revenues by contract and developed key
reports from that data. The reports have been designed to detect errors or omissions related to key maintenance data. Further, we have trained the revenue accounting team on how to carefully analyze
the reports to ensure that inaccuracies are detected and corrected. We believe these steps have fully remediated this weakness. 
In
making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO
in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Because of the material weaknesses described in the preceding paragraphs, our management believes that, as of December31, 2004, our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria. 
Our
independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. It appears on page57. 
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
During the quarter ended December31, 2004, we implemented the following changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting: We
have developed additional procedures in the area of monitoring compliance with regulatory tax compliance and computations of the financial statement impact on income
taxes.
The
Director of Finance assumed additional responsibilities for the administration of on-line banking systems and we have established additional system
procedures regarding terminated employees, both in an effort to reduce the risk of unauthorized cash transactions.
We
have implemented additional policies and procedures in order to protect computer networks and user desktop computer systems from computer viruses.
We
have prepared detailed job descriptions for all IT and finance employees in order to achieve clearer communications with employees on job responsibilities Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal
controls will prevent all error and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met. Further, the design of a control 
93  system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error
or fraud may occur and not be detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.
