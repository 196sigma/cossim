financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. The financial statements of Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the year
ended December31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased
operations and whose report dated February7, 2002, expressed an unqualified
opinion on those statements. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Kos

53 Table of Contents KOS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. General Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Kos or the Company develops prescription
pharmaceutical products principally for the cardiovascular and respiratory
markets. On July28, 1997, the Company received clearance from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration FDA to market Niaspan for the treatment of mixed lipid
disorders, a condition in which a patient is observed to have several
abnormalities in the levels of the fatlike substances, called lipids, that
contribute to heart disease. Niaspan is the only once-a-day prescription and
the first extended-release formulation of any type of product with niacin as
the active ingredient ever approved by the FDA for the treatment of mixed lipid
disorders. Niaspan is indicated for the following: ireduce elevated total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, commonly referred to as LDL
or bad cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, another lipid particle, and
increase low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, commonly referred to as HDL
or good cholesterol; iireduce very high serum triglycerides, which are
fatty substances in the blood that contribute to heart disease; iiireduce
elevated total and LDL cholesterol when used in combination with a bile-binding
resin, which is a different class of drugs that reduces bad cholesterol; iv
reduce recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction, or the recurrence of nonfatal
heart attacks; and vpromote the regression or slow the progression of
atherosclerosis, which is a medical condition involving the narrowing of the
arteries to the heart, when combined with bile-binding resins. Additionally,
Niaspans prescribing information references its ability to significantly
reduce lipoprotein a, which is referred to as the very bad cholesterol and
is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease. On January28, 2002, the Company launched Advicor, a new solid-dose drug
containing Niaspan and lovastatin, which is a currently marketed
cholesterol-lowering drug, for the treatment of mixed lipid disorders. The
Company believes that a once-a-night tablet with the combined complementary
properties of its Niaspan product and lovastatin represents an effective method
for treating patients with mixed lipid disorders. The Company is currently developing several other products in solid-dose
and inhaled dosage forms. No assurance can be given that the Companys products can be successfully
marketed, that products under development can be successfully formulated or
manufactured at acceptable cost and with appropriate quality, or that required
regulatory approvals will be obtained. The Company is subject to a number of
other risks including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to market
acceptance, future capital needs and uncertainty of additional funding,
including its ability to meet all of the conditions necessary to obtain funding
under its credit facilities with Michael Jaharis; uncertainties related to the
protection afforded by the Companys patents and patent applications;
uncertainties related to foreign regulatory approvals; uncertainties related to
patents and trademarks, including interference and risk of infringement;
uncertainties related to competition and technological changes, government
regulation, dependence on product development collaborators, limited
manufacturing experience and risk of scale-up, dependence on single sources of
supply; and no assurances of adequate third party reimbursement. The likelihood
of the success of the Company also must be considered in light of the
uncertainty caused by problems, expenses, complications, and delays frequently
encountered in connection with the development of new business ventures. 54 Table of Contents 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the results of the Company
and its subsidiaries, Aeropharm Technology, Inc. and Kos Life Sciences, Inc.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions made by
management in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements include
the allowance for doubtful accounts; reserves for inventory obsolescence,
product returns, chargebacks, rebates, discounts and other sales allowances;
estimation of customer inventory levels; and the valuation allowance on
deferred income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
original maturity of 90days or less to be cash equivalents. As of December31,
2003, $17,800,000 of cash and cash equivalents were pledged as collateral on
outstanding letters of credit. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company specifically analyzes its trade receivables and provides
reserves for items determined not to be collectable. In addition, the Company
provides general reserves for a portion of receivables where items, generally
based on age, are deemed to represent a significant risk of loss. Historically,
the Company has not had significant write-offs. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
using the first-in, first-out method. Components of inventory cost include raw
materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead. The Company considers factors
such as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such
inventories, remaining shelf life, and current market conditions to determine
whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Certain raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its
Niaspan and Advicor products are available from a limited number of suppliers.
The Company is dependent on its suppliers to allocate a sufficient portion of
their capacity to meet the Companys needs. Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is
measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such
evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain
long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such
assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. 55 Table of Contents The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets held for
sale by comparing the assets carrying amount with its fair value less cost to
sell. No assets were held for sale as of December31, 2003 or 2002. Fair Value of Financial Instruments As of December31, 2003 and 2002, the carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair
value due to the short term nature of these accounts. The fair value of notes
payable to shareholder is determined using interest rates in effect as of the
balance sheet date and, because interest expense is payable utilizing variable
rates that re-price frequently, the carrying value approximates fair value. Concentration of Credit Risk The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with a major financial
institution. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit
standing of this institution to limit its credit risk exposure. The Company conducts a significant amount of its sales with a limited
number of large pharmaceutical wholesalers and warehousing chains. Accordingly,
86% of the trade accounts receivable before allowances at December31, 2003,
were represented by five of these customers. The Company performs periodic
evaluations of the financial condition of all customers to limit its credit
risk exposure, but does not obtain collateral. The Company has no significant
off-balance-sheet concentrations of credit risk. Revenue Recognition Sales and the related cost of sales are recognized at the time product
arrives at the customers location. The Companys largest customers are
distributors who warehouse product and, in turn, sell that product to retailers
and others. Net sales consist of gross sales to the Companys customers less
provisions for expected returns from customers, customer discounts, and rebates
and chargebacks to managed care organizations with whom the Company has
contracts. These provisions totaled $82,967,000, $44,369,000, and $19,542,000
for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Included
in Accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are
$20,283,000 and $11,070,000, at December31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
related to these provisions. Accounting for Product Returns Impact on Revenue Recognition The Company periodically evaluates the volume of its Niaspan and Advicor
products that are in customer inventories or elsewhere in the distribution
channel to determine whether increased risk of product returns exists. For the
period from the introduction of its products through December31, 2002, Kos
return risk expectations were consistently based on its limited product return
experience given the early stage nature of its products and of the Company.
Accordingly, Kos established a specific return risk estimate based on estimated
inventory levels in the distribution channel that was used to determine the
amount of revenue that could be recorded during a given period. During the
quarter ended March31, 2003, as a result of the significant history of minimal
returns for both products since their introduction, Kos revised its return risk
estimates to reflect the historically low product return patterns. This change
in accounting estimate resulted in the Company recognizing as revenue all
product shipments made during the year ended December31, 2003, as well as
$111million of its prior period product shipments not previously recognized
as revenue because of its previous product return risk exposure estimates. The
impact of this change in estimate increased the Companys reported revenues,
net income, and basic and diluted earnings per share by $111million, $99
million, and $045 per share and $024 per share, respectively, for the year
ended December31, 2003. The Company will continue to monitor wholesaler
inventory levels, and, if the Companys product return risk exceeds acceptable
levels, the Company may 56 Table of Contents be required to not recognize the revenue and related costs associated with
the excess inventory until such return risk is mitigated. Advance Payment Received on License Agreement On October23, 2002, the Company signed an exclusive international
commercialization agreement with Merck KGaA Merck to market the Companys
Niaspan and Advicor products outside the United States, Canada and Japan. Under
terms of the agreement, Merck will provide Kos up to $61million in licensing,
milestone and reimbursement payments, including $15million of upfront
payments, of which $125million are refundable to Merck by Kos if it fails to
achieve certain regulatory milestones. The milestone payments are dependent on
the achievement of certain regulatory approvals and sales thresholds. Kos will
also receive 25% of net sales of the products in the territory, which includes
the cost of goods sold. Merck will be responsible for conducting Phase IV
clinical studies and commercialization activities while Kos is responsible for
obtaining initial marketing authorization in all major European countries and
for the supply and manufacturing of the products. Through December31, 2003,
Kos has received $15million in upfront and reimbursement payments from Merck.
Of this amount, $229,000 was offset against research and development expenses
during the year ended December31, 2003. The majority of these payments,
however, will be recognized as revenue in future periods upon Kos achieving
certain regulatory milestones. Co-Promotion and Strategic Alliance Arrangements During 1999, the Company entered into a co-promotion collaboration
agreement with Knoll Pharmaceutical Company Knoll, for the promotion and
marketing of Knolls Mavik and Tarka products Mavik and Tarka are registered
trademarks of Abbott Laboratories within the United States the Knoll
Agreement. Under the terms of the Knoll Agreement, the Company was to receive
an increasing percentage of revenue based on sales thresholds. The Company
recorded $72million of co-promotion revenue as a result of the Knoll
Agreement for the year ended December31, 2001. On March2, 2001, Abbott
Laboratories Abbott announced that it had finalized its acquisition of
BASFs pharmaceutical business, which included the global operations of Knoll.
The Company and Abbott agreed to terminate the Knoll Agreement effective
January1, 2002. The Company entered into an agreement, effective May3, 2000, with DuPont
Pharmaceuticals Company DuPont to form a strategic alliance for the purpose
of co-promoting the Companys Advicor product in the United States and Canada
the DuPont Agreement. Under the terms of the DuPont Agreement, the Company
and DuPont would have shared in the future development and commercialization of
the Advicor product. Specifically, DuPont had agreed ito make equity
investments in the Company of up to $30million through the date of FDA
approval of the Advicor product; iito pay the Company $175million in
milestone payments upon FDA approval of the Advicor product; iiito fund up
to $325million for future clinical development of the Advicor product; and
ivto share equally in the costs associated with promoting the Advicor
product and share equally in product profits after deducting a royalty to the
Company. On May31, 2000, DuPont made a $20-million equity investment in the
Company in exchange for 1,250,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock. On June
7, 2001, DuPonts parent company, E.I. du Pont Nemours, announced that it had
entered into an agreement to sell DuPont to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
BMS and on October1, 2001, BMS completed its acquisition of DuPont. On
December17, 2001, the Company entered into an agreement with BMS pursuant to
which the DuPont Agreement was terminated and BMS paid Kos $45million the
BMS Payment. The BMS Payment, offset by approximately $6million of
promotional expenses due to Kos by BMS at the time of termination, was recorded
as Other Income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
the year ended December31, 2001. On October17, 2003, the Company entered into a three-year agreement with
Takeda Pharmaceuticals North America, Inc. Takeda to co-promote Niaspan and
Advicor in the United States. Pursuant to this 57 Table of Contents agreement, Takeda will utilize its U.S.-based sales force to promote
Niaspan and Advicor in addition to its own product. Takeda is responsible for
providing a promotional effort that is expected to significantly increase the
amount of product details performed per year, and for all costs associated with
its sales force, including promotional materials and samples. The Company is
responsible for manufacturing and supplying both products and will collect and
record all sales associated with its products. Takeda will receive a royalty on
incremental net sales of the products in the United States above a certain
baseline amount. This co-promotion arrangement has a three-year term commencing
January2004 and provides for residual payments to Takeda after the three
years, if the parties do not renew the agreement. Fixed Assets Fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease
terms as follows

3-5   Laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
10   Leasehold improvements 
Shorter of 7-10   
years or lives of   
leases Effective January1, 2002, the Company made certain prospective changes in
the estimated useful lives of most of its fixed assets. This change was made to
better reflect how the assets are expected to be used over time and to provide
a better matching of revenues and expenses. The effect of this change on net
loss for 2002 was not material. Research and Development Expenses All research and development expenses are reflected in the Companys
consolidated statements of operations as incurred. Advertising Expense The Company records the cost of its advertising efforts when services are
performed or goods are delivered. The Company recorded $6,829,000, $7,279,000,
and $6,781,000 in advertising expense for the years ended December31, 2003,
2002, and 2001, respectively. 58 Table of Contents Net Income Loss Per Share Basic earnings lossper share is determined by dividing the Companys
net income lossby the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding. Diluted income lossper share also includes dilutive Common

Income Taxes The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS
No109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which requires, among other things,
recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to
deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax
bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss carryforwards to
the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not. As of
December31, 2003, the Company had available approximately $1467million of
net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2004 and 2021. 59 Table of Contents The composition of the net deferred tax assets is as follows

The Company has an accumulated deficit as of December31, 2003, of
approximately $2339million. Excluding the impact of the BMS Payment, the
Company generated full-year income before provision for income taxes for the
first time in 2003. Management has re-evaluated the continuing need for a
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and, based on the history of
net losses, concluded that there is not sufficient evidence as of December31,
2003, to conclude that the Company will more likely than not realize all or a
portion of its deferred tax assets. However, if in the future management
concludes that some or all of its deferred tax assets will more likely than
not be realized, then the Company will be required to recognize such assets by
reversing all or the applicable portion of the valuation allowance. There was no provision for income taxes for the years ended December31,
2002 and 2001. Although the Company has sufficient net operating losses to
offset taxable income, the use of net operating losses is limited under federal
alternative minimum tax rules to 90% of taxable income. Similar rules apply to
state taxing jurisdictions where state income tax is based on an apportionment
of federal taxable income. Consequently, the Company recorded a provision for
income taxes of $2,878,821 for the year ended December31, 2003 to reflect
$1,259,368 in federal alternative minimum tax and $1,619,453 in state income
tax liabilities that cannot be offset by utilizing the Companys net operating
loss carryforwards. A reconciliation between the statutory federal income tax
expense and the income tax expense at the Companys effective rate for the
years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is set forth below

60 Table of Contents Reporting of Comprehensive Income or Loss SFAS No130 Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full set
of financial statements. Comprehensive income or loss refers to revenues,
expenses, gains and losses that are not included in net income or loss but
rather are recorded directly in stockholders equity, such as certain
unrealized gain or loss items. The Companys reported net income lossequals
comprehensive income lossfor all periods presented. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation As permitted by SFAS No148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
SFAS 148, which amended SFAS No123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation, the Company accounts for options issued to employees and to
outside directors after June30, 2000 under Accounting Principles Board
APB Opinion No25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25.
Except for compensation cost of $774,000, included in Selling, general and
administrative in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations,
related to the modification of a terminated employees options in 2003, no
compensation cost has been recognized on options issued to employees because
the exercise price of such options was not less than the market value of the
Common Stock on the date of grant. Had compensation cost for options issued to
employees been determined consistent with SFAS 148, the Companys net income
lossand net income lossper share would have been the Pro forma amounts

61 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued
Interpretation No46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities on
Interpretation of ARB No51 FIN 46, to expand upon and strengthen
existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in
its financial statements the assets, liabilities and activities of another
entity. In December2003, the FASB issued FIN 46R to clarify certain
provisions of FIN 46 and to modify the effective date of such provisions for
public companies. Until now, a company generally has included another entity in
its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through
voting interests. FIN 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity,
as defined, to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a
majority of the expected losses as defined from the variable interest
entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual
returns or both. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest
entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a
significant variable interest. Based on the revised guidance, all public
companies must apply the provisions of FIN 46R to variable interests commonly
referred to as special-purpose entities an SPE, where such interests were
created prior to February1, 2003, no later than periods ending after December
15, 2003. Interests created in non-SPE variable interest entities after January
31, 2003 but before December31, 2003 are subject to the provisions of the
original FIN 46 in 2003, but the provisions of FIN 46R must be adopted no
later than the first reporting period ending after March15, 2004. The
provisions of FIN 46R must be applied to all variable interests created after
December31, 2003 upon initial involvement with the variable interest entity.
The adoption of FIN 46 is not expected to have a material impact on the
Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB
reached consensus on EITF 00-21 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables EITF 00-21. EITF 00-21 addresses how to determine whether an
arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of
accounting. EITF 00-21 also provides guidance regarding the separation of
deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement and the allocation of total
arrangement consideration to the discrete units of accounting for situations
not governed by existing, higher-level authoritative literature. EITF 00-21 is
effective for revenue arrangements entered into in periods including quarterly
periods beginning after June30, 2003. Companies are permitted, but not
required, to apply the consensus guidance to existing arrangements as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in accordance with APB
Opinion No20, Accounting Changes. The adoption of EITF 00-21 did not impact
the Companys financial position or results of operations because the Company
does not currently have any multiple-deliverables revenue arrangements. 3. Trade Accounts Receivable, net Trade accounts receivable consist of the following

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $3,310,964, $2,110,538, and
$2,766,244 for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. 6. Goodwill In late 1999, the Company acquired, for total consideration of $11
million, substantially all of the assets and intellectual property of IEP
Group, Inc. the IEP Acquisition. In connection with this transaction, the
Company recorded goodwill of $803,000 representing the excess of the cost of
the assets acquired over their estimated fair value. The pre-acquisition
results of IEP Group, Inc. IEP were not material to the Companys results
of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2001, in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, the Company recorded a goodwill
impairment loss of $642,551, based on its determination of fair-value of such
goodwill. Prior to recording such impairment loss, the Company had recognized
amortization expense of $80,318 for the year ended December31, 2001.
Accordingly, the Company recorded $722,869 of amortization expense during the
year ended December31, 2001. 63 Table of Contents 7. Accrued Expenses The components of accrued expenses are as follows

8. Notes Payable to Shareholder On December19, 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Michael
Jaharis, Chairman Emeritus of the Companys Board of Directors and its
principal shareholder, whereby Mr.Jaharis agreed to replace the previous
$30-million credit facility extended to the Company on July1, 1998 which was
to expire on December31, 2002, with a new facility expiring on June30, 2008
the Additional Standby Facility. In connection with this new credit
arrangement, the Company granted to Mr.Jaharis non-detachable warrants to
purchase 1,000,000 shares of the Companys Common Stock at an exercise price
based on the market price of the Companys Common Stock on the date that the
first draw under this facility occurs. The Company had no borrowings
outstanding under the Additional Standby Facility as of December31, 2003.
Borrowings, when outstanding, will bear interest at the prime rate 40% as of
December31, 2003, and will be subject to the terms and conditions of
borrowings made under the Supplemental Credit Facility, as defined below. On September1, 1999, the Company formally agreed to the terms of a
$50-million funding arrangement initially entered into with Mr.Jaharis on
October7, 1998 the Supplemental Credit Facility. On July21, 2001, the
Company replaced its existing $50million promissory note payable to Mr.
Jaharis with two, $25million, promissory notes, one payable in the name of Mr.
Jaharis and the other payable in the name of Mr.Jaharis wife. With this
promissory note replacement, all of Mr.Jaharis existing rights and
obligations under the Supplemental Credit Facility, with respect to one-half of
the outstanding amount, were transferred to Mrs.Jaharis, and were subsequently
transferred by Mrs.Jaharis to a limited partnership the Limited
Partnership that she controls. All other terms and conditions of the
Supplemental Credit Facility remained unchanged. Borrowings under the
Supplemental Credit Facility were convertible at $491 per share and accrued
interest at the prime rate. On November25, 2003, in connection with an equity
offering of the Companys Common Stock pursuant to an effective shelf
registration statement, the limited partnership controlled by Mrs.Jaharis
exercised its right to convert $6,137,500 of borrowings outstanding under the
Supplemental Credit Facility into 1,250,000 shares of the Companys Common
Stock. Those shares were then sold by such limited partnership as part of the
equity offering. The Company did not receive any proceeds from such sale by the
limited partnership controlled by Mrs.Jaharis. On December31, 2003, all then
remaining borrowings under the Supplemental Credit Facility, which totaled
$43,862,500 and bore interest at the prime rate, were converted into shares of
the Companys Common Stock. The Supplemental Credit Facility terminated as of
December31, 2003. On December21, 1999, Mr.Jaharis agreed to extend another $50-million
loan to the Company the Standby Facility. Borrowings made under the Standby
Facility totaled $30million as of December31, 2003, are due June30, 2005,
and are also subject to most of the terms and conditions of borrowings made
under the Supplemental Credit Facility, including the condition that the death
of lender shall not have 64 Table of Contents occurred. In lieu of a conversion feature, the Company has granted to Mr.
Jaharis non-detachable warrants to purchase 6,000,000 shares of the Companys
Common Stock at $500 per share, which approximated the market value of the
Companys Common Stock on the effective date of the Standby Facility. The
warrants are exercisable at any time until June30, 2006. The exercise of a
significant number of the warrants issued under the Standby Facility will cause
material dilution to existing shareholders of the Company. As of December31, 2003, all of the Companys assets were pledged as
collateral for the Additional Standby Facility and the Standby Facility. The Company recorded $3,321,000, $4,040,000 and $6,081,000 of interest
expense for the years ended December31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
related to its credit facilities with Mr.Jaharis and his transferees. 9. Major Customers Sales to customers that were at least 10% of the Companys net sales are

shares effective on the date of the Companys Annual Shareholders Meeting. The
exercise price of such options is the fair market value of the underlying
Common Stock on the date the option is granted. The Company considered the
provisions of SFAS No123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS
123 using the Black-Scholes method to approximate the related charge to
expense for all options granted to outside directors through June30, 2000.
Subsequent to June30, 2000, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 44,
which allows grantors to account for options to outside directors under APB 25.
The Company provides the required disclosures of pro forma net income loss
and related per share amounts under the fair value method in Note 2 hereto in
accordance with SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148. Assumptions used in the

United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, against the Company, the members of the Companys Board of Directors,
certain officers of Kos, and the underwriters of the Companys October1997
offering of shares of Common Stock. In its complaint, the plaintiff asserts, on
behalf of itself and a putative class of purchasers of the Companys Common
Stock during the period from July29, 1997, through November13, 1997, claims
under: isections 11, 12a2 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933; ii
sections 10b and 20a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule10b-5
promulgated thereunder; and iiifor common law fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. The claims in the lawsuit
relate principally to certain statements made by the Company, or certain of its
representatives, concerning the efficacy, safety, sales volume and commercial
viability of the Niaspan product. The complaint sought unspecified damages and
costs, including attorneys fees and costs and expenses. Upon Kos motion, the
case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint
against the Company and the individual Kos defendants on January7, 1999. On
May24, 1999, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed an appeal on
June7, 1999, with the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
11th Circuit. On July16, 2002, the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Courts dismissal of the
plaintiffs claims with prejudice. The plaintiffs petitioned the Court of
Appeals for a rehearing of the appeal, which was denied by the Court of
Appeals. Recently, one of the plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of
Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court from the 11th
Circuit decision, which was denied by the United States Supreme Court. On January23, 2002, the Company received notice from Barr Laboratories,
Inc. Barr that it had filed with the FDA an Abbreviated New Drug
Application ANDA that, if approved, would allow Barr to market a generic
version of the Companys 1000 mg Niaspan product. As a result, on March4,
2002, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Barr in the
Southern District of New York SDNY. On March11, 2002, the Company filed an
amended complaint the Amended Complaint. In this lawsuit, the Company
asserted that Barr has infringed Kos 6,080,428 and 6,129,930 patents. On March
25, 2002, Barr answered the Amended Complaint the Answer by denying that
the 428 and 930 patents are valid and infringed, and seeking a declaratory
judgment to that effect. On August19, 2002, Barr amended its Answer to add
counterclaims requesting a declaratory judgment that two other patents owned by
Kos, U.S. Patent Number 5,126,145 and 5,268,181, are not infringed, and that
the 181 patent is invalid. On July9, 2002, the Company received notice from Barr that it had filed
an ANDA with the FDA that would, if approved, allow Barr to market generic
versions of the Companys 500 mg and 750 mg Niaspan products. On August13,
2002, the Company filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against Barr also
in the SDNY. Again, the Company asserted that Barr has infringed the 428 and
930 patents. On September3, 2002, Barr answered the complaint by denying
infringement and alleging that the patents are invalid. Barr also sought a
declaratory judgment that the 428, 930, 145, and 181 patents are not
infringed, and that the 428, 930, and 181 patents are invalid. The two cases
were consolidated on September23, 2002. On September30, 2002, the Company received notice from Barr that it had
filed a Supplemental ParagraphIV Certification relating to Kos 6,406,715
patent. The Company filed a third lawsuit on
November12, 2002, against Barr in the SDNY asserting infringement of this
patent. On December3 72 Table of Contents 2002, Barr answered the complaint by denying that the
715 patent is valid and infringed, and seeking a declaratory judgment of
invalidity. Barr also sought a declaratory judgment that the 428, 930, 145,
and 181 patents are not infringed, and that the 428, 930 and 181 patents
are invalid. The third case was consolidated with the first two on January23, 2003. On
March4, 2003, Kos replied to Barrs declaratory judgment counterclaims by
denying that Kos patents are invalid or not infringed. Kos also sought a
declaratory judgment that one or more of Barrs products will infringe the 145
and 181 patents. During the course of the litigation, Barr has also suggested
claims of anti trust and unenforceability. Kos has received several notices
from Barr Laboratories that Barr has filed a Supplemental ParagraphIV
Certification to each ANDA to provide for U.S. Patent No6,676,967. The first
notice was received by Kos on January21, 2004 and the latest on February23,
2004. Kos is currently evaluating its options. On August6, 2003, the Company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit
against Andrx Corporation and Andrx Laboratories, Inc. Andrx in the U.S.
