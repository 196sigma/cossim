  \caption{\textbf{Institutional Ownership and Accounting Comparability}}
  \caption*{\Fontvi In each year, I sort industries by average accounting comparability and group them into $COMP$ quintiles. I then aggregate all industry-year observations within each quintile across the entire sample period. The first column reports the mean institutional ownership percentage of firms within each industry quintile. Industry types are based on Thomson Reuters' classification: 1) bank trust departments; 2) insurance companies; 3) insurance companies; 4) independent investment advisors; 5) other institutions (e.g. pension funds, foundations, and university endowments).}
