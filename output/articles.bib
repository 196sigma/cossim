Abstract = {{We attempt to measure the effect of competition on bias in the context
   of analyst earnings forecasts, which are known to be excessively
   optimistic because of conflicts of interest. Our natural experiment for
   competition is mergers of brokerage houses, which result in the firing
   of analysts because of redundancy (e.g., one of the two oil stock
   analysts is let go) and other reasons such as culture clash. We use this
   decrease in analyst coverage for stocks covered by both merging houses
   before the merger (the treatment sample) to measure the causal effect of
   competition on bias. We find that the treatment sample simultaneously
   experiences a decrease in analyst coverage and an increase in optimism
   bias the year after the merger relative to a control group of stocks,
   consistent with competition reducing bias. The implied economic effect
   from our natural experiment is significantly larger than estimates from
   OLS regressions that do not correct for the endogeneity of coverage.
   This effect is much more significant for stocks with little initial
   analyst coverage or competition.}},

   factors and transaction costs that are proportional to liquidity. The

Abstract = {{This article develops and applies new measures of portfolio performance
   which use benchmarks based on the characteristics of stocks held by the
   portfolios that are evaluated. Specifically, the benchmarks are
   constructed from the returns of 125 passive portfolios that are matched
   with stocks held in the evaluated portfolio on the basis of the market
   capitalization, book-to-market, and prior-year return characteristics of
   those stocks. Based on these benchmarks, `' Characteristic Timing `' and
   `' Characteristic Selectivity `' measures are developed that detect,
   respectively, whether portfolio managers successfully time their
   portfolio weightings on these characteristics and whether managers can
   select stocks that outperform the average stock having the same
   characteristics. We apply these measures to a new database of mutual
   fund holdings covering over 2500 equity funds from 1975 to 1994. Our
   results show that mutual funds, particularly aggressive-growth funds,
   exhibit some selectivity ability, but that funds exhibit no
   characteristic timing ability.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary
   bootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators and
   constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly dependent
   stationary observations. Previously, a technique based on resampling
   blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to construct
   confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional joint
   distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed. This
   procedure has been generalized by constructing a `'blocks of blocks''
   resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures even for a
   multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional) joint
   distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These methods
   share the construction of resampling blocks of observations to form a
   pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may be
   recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context of
   applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require the
   resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on the
   original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures lack this
   property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed stationary
   and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary procedure is
   based on resampling blocks of random length, where the length of each
   block has a geometric distribution. In this article, fundamental
   consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary resampling
   scheme are developed.}},

We find that changes in ownership by institutions with large positions in a firm are consistent with informed trading. However, other previously documented proxies for private information produce results more consistent with risk-based trading (e.g., investment style) or insignificant in the presence of other proxies (e.g., fiduciary type). We also find that informed trading is more prevalent in small firms and when the large positions are taken by investment advisers and large institutions.},

In equilibrium, the quantity and quality of information affect asset prices.

   on simple earnings-based heuristics in evaluating firm performance, so
   we expect public banks to have more incentives to report steadily
   increasing earnings. Consistent with this expectation, we find that
   relative to private banks, public banks: (1) report fewer small earnings
   declines, (2) are more likely to use the loan loss provision and
   security gain realizations to eliminate small earnings decreases, and
   (3) report longer strings of consecutive earnings increases. These

Based on the ``realizable'' and the ``earned'' criteria of SFAC No. 5 (FASB in Concepts statement no. 5.

In this study, I examine the effects of selling-price estimates in revenue recognition on the contracting and informational roles of financial statements. Particularly, I examine the setting of SOP 97-2 (AICPA in Software revenue recognition. Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, AICPA, New York, 1997) that removed software firms' flexibility to recognize revenues using selling-price estimates.

abstract ={This study documents an association between changes in institutional ownership during a calendar quarter and abnormal returns at the time of subsequent announcements of quarterly earnings. The result is driven by the portfolio returns of the extreme deciles of changes in institutional ownership, suggesting that institutions trade based on information about future earnings, but that such trading is not widespread. We also find that the difference between earnings announcement returns of the extreme deciles of change in institutional ownership is much greater when change in institutional ownership of a stock is driven by relatively few institutions, measured using the skewness of the distribution of change in institutional ownership of the stock. This result suggests that when fewer differentially informed investors make disproportionately large purchases or sales of stocks, a greater amount of the information on which they base their trades is not impounded in prices until the subsequent earnings announcement. Finally, we show that our results obtain for institutional investors with short-term focus, such as independent advisors, investment companies and insurance companies, but not for institutional investors with long- term focus, such as internally managed pension funds, educational institutions, and private foundations. This result further supports our conclusions regarding informed trading by institutions based on information about forthcoming earnings.},

The association between firm-level opacity and informed trading is most pronounced where country-level disclosure infrastructures are less developed and for those investors for whom the incentives and opportunities to acquire private information are greatest. A difference-in-differences analysis of the returns earned by institutions in opaque stocks suggests that this information advantage is economically significant. "

Following an expansion (contraction) in the availability of bank loans, leverage ratios of bank-dependent firms significantly increase (decrease) relative to firms with bond market access. Concurrent changes in the composition of financing sources lend further support to the role of credit supply and debt market segmentation in capital structure choice.},

abstract="We investigate the effects of mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption on the comparability of financial accounting information. Using a set of alternative comparability measures, our results suggest that the overall comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption is marginal. We hypothesize that firm-level heterogeneity in IFRS compliance explains the limited comparability effect. To test this conjecture, we first hand-collect data on IFRS compliance for a sample of German and Italian firms and find that firm-, region-, and country-level incentives systematically shape IFRS compliance. We then use these compliance determinants to explain the variance in the comparability effect of mandatory IFRS adoption and find that only firms with high compliance incentives experience substantial increases in comparability. Moreover, we document that firms from countries with tighter reporting enforcement experience larger IFRS comparability effects, and that public firms adopting IFRS become less comparable to local GAAP private firms from the same country.",

Abstract = {{This paper examines whether institutional investors create or reduce
   incentives for corporate managers to reduce investment in research and
   development (R\&D) to meet short-term earnings goals. Many critics argue
   that the frequent trading and short-term focus of institutional
   investors encourages managers to engage in such myopic investment
   behavior. Others argue that the large stockholdings and sophistication
   of institutions allow managers to focus on long-term value rather than
   on short-term earnings. I examine these competing views by testing
   whether institutional ownership affects R\&D spending for firms that
   could reverse a decline in earnings with a reduction in R\&D. The
   results indicate that managers are less likely to cut R\&D to reverse an
   earnings decline when institutional ownership is high, implying that
   institutions are sophisticated investors who typically serve a
   monitoring role in reducing pressures for myopic behavior. However, I
   find that a large proportion of ownership by institutions that have high
   portfolio turnover and engage in momentum trading significantly
   increases the probability that managers reduce R\&D to reverse an
   earnings decline. These results indicate that high turnover and momentum
   trading by institutional investors encourages myopic investment behavior
   when such institutional investors have extremely high levels of
   ownership in a firm; otherwise, institutional ownership serves to reduce
   pressures on managers for myopic investment behavior.}},

These findings persist after controlling for contemporaneous earnings performance and other potentially influential variables, such as risk, growth, and firm size. While it is difficult to draw unambiguous causal conclusions, these results are consistent with disclosure model predictions that expanded disclosure leads investors to revise upward valuations of the sample firms' stocks, increases stock liquidity, and creates additional institutional and analyst interest in the stocks.},

The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they are apt to consider attention to small matters as not for their master's honour, and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it.

abstract="As part of its push for more plain English in disclosures, the SEC argues that firms should use more concrete language to make abstract concepts clearer to investors. We use two experiments to show that, when concrete language is highlighted in a prospectus, investors are significantly more willing to invest in a firm than when abstract language is highlighted. Furthermore, we show the effect of concrete language is particularly important when investors feel more psychologically distant from a firm. Drawing on psychology theory, we predict and find that concrete language increases investors' feelings of comfort in their ability to evaluate an investment. Our study contributes to the literature on how language choices in disclosures affect investors' judgments by demonstrating that a simple, yet potentially powerful reporting tool of emphasizing concrete language may attract investors who may otherwise be reluctant to invest.",

Previous theoretical work on disclosure of new information by firms has demonstrated that releasing public information will often make all shareholders worse off, due to an adverse risk-sharing effect. This paper uses a general equilibrium model with endogenous information collection to demonstrate that there exists a policy of disclosure of information which makes all shareholders better off than a policy of no disclosure. The welfare improvement occurs because of explicit information cost savings and improved risk sharing. This provides a positive theory of precommitment to disclosure, because it will be unanimously voted for by stockholders and will also represent the policy that will maximize value ex ante. In addition, it provides a "missing link" in financial signalling models. Apart from the effects on information production analyzed in this paper, most existing financial signalling models are inconsistent with a firm taking actions which facilitate future signalling because release of the signal makes all investors worse off.},

   show that co-search intensity captures the degree of similarity between
   firms. Our results highlight the potential of the collective wisdom of
   investors extracted from co-search patterns in addressing long-standing
   benchmarking problems in finance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We examine the valuation performance of a comprehensive list of value
   drivers and find that multiples derived from forward earnings explain
   stock prices remarkably well: pricing errors are within 15 percent of
   stock prices for about half our sample. In terms of relative
   performance, the following general rankings are observed consistently
   each year: forward earnings measures are followed by historical earnings
   measures, cash flow measures and book value of equity are tied for
   third, and sales performs the worst. Curiously, performance declines
   when we consider more complex measures of intrinsic value based on
   short-cut residual income models. Contrary to the popular view that
   different industries have different ``best{''} multiples, these overall
   rankings are observed consistently for almost all industries examined.
   Since we require analysts' earnings and growth forecasts and positive
   values for all measures, our results may not be representative of the
   many firm-years excluded from our sample.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we examine the relation between corporate governance and
   institutional ownership. Our empirical results show that the fraction of
   a company's shares that are held by institutional investors increases
   with the quality of its governance structure. In a similar vein, we show
   that the proportion of institutions that hold a firm's shares increases
   with its governance quality. Our results are robust to different
   estimation methods and alternative model specifications. These results
   are consistent with the conjecture that institutional investors
   gravitate to stocks of companies with good governance structure to meet
   fiduciary responsibility as well as to minimize monitoring and exit
   costs.}},
